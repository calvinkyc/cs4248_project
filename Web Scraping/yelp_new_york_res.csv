0,Came here for NYC cookies to give as gifts - the family loved them! These cookies are the perfect texture and great warm! Be aware that they are very very sweet.
1,"Putting in my $0.02 on Levain among the 5,000+ reviews! I was really excited to try the Internet's most hyped cookie. At $4.50, this cookie lives up to its reputation! We came in on a random weekday and the cookies were fresh and ready. I grabbed the chocolate chip walnut and my friend got the chocolate chip, both were absolutely delightful, warm, and full of buttery, sugary goodness. They are also just so good the next day too. Definitely worth trying a Levain cookie and I highly recommend you walk over to Central Park to walk around and enjoy your cookie on a walk in the park."
2,"Of course they are good. Get them, try them, share them, heat them slightly...enjoy that classic nyc favorite. I have to say, given nycs cookie scene is on fire right now....these are still great, but I wouldn't be surprised if some other cookie cult like shops surpass it soon. In my heart, when Rocco dispirito said he loved this place, I knew I would too.  Here's to classic nyc."
3,"This is the second time I've tried these cookies. Before I write my review, I wanted to give a quick shout out to Lydia who works in customer relations. I previously had an unpleasant experience at the upper west side location and she reached out to me almost immediately to apologize. Not only did she listen to all of my feedback and concerns, but she ensured me that she would reach out to staff at the location to provide more training. She also ended up refunding me for the cookie I purchased and generously mailed out a box of cookies for me. This is a company that truly values and appreciates their customers. I would definitely recommend this bakery to my friends.Now, about the cookies. Pros: cookies are very large, so you only really need one to fill you up! Lots of chocolate chips in the chocolate chip cookie, which makes it very chocolatey. It's not too sweet. I ended up having my cookies shipped to me, and I was told to pop them in the oven at 350 deg for 5 minutes. This was the perfect setting, and led to an ooey-gooey center when I broke the cookie in half (believe me I was skeptical about this description at first too, but it's real). Cons: price of one cookie is $4.50. However, based on the size of the cookie, you definitely get your moneys worth. The cookie has a crisp exterior and a soft interior. I personally like my cookies soft all around. It seems the cookies get hard quick, and probably need to be warmed up if you bring them home from the store."
4,"We had these cookies mailed to us... from my husband's employer in NY. So random, but we welcome it. We loved it! This was a nice surprise, it was delivered right to our front door, all the way from the big apple to CA. Amazing. And these cookies are something else. It's so delicious!! The cookies are huge and it looks like mini muffins. Haha it was rather daunting at first, but after the first bite, you'll want to keep eating and before you know it, it's all gone! :/ Anyways, we had the honor to try their oatmeal raisins, choco chip walnut, dark choco choco, and dark choco peanut butter.  And not one of those cookies were a letdown. They were so goood! We ate them as is and apparently after we talked to some of my hubby's coworkers, the cookies would have been better had we microwaved it for a bit? Oh well. It was all gone by then lol. I can't wait to go to NY to get these in person, in the store!"
5,"What can I say? It's Levain's cookies, everyone knows how good they are and indeed it was freakin' warm gooey and delicious. The most delicious chocolate walnut and peanut butter chocolate cookies ever.About 5 dollars per cookie though. Good for those on occasion cravings."
6,"I have never heard of this place before until I received a gift box of assorted cookies. I am not a big cookie fan and I wasn't sure what to expect. When it was delivered, it felt like a ton--it was so heavy for such a small box. It is truegood things come in small packages! It was so nicely wrapped. None of the cookies were broken upon delivery! I received  a chocolate chip, peanut butter chocolate, chcocolate chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin cookie--4 cookies don't seem like much but these were thick, heavy and packed in deliciousness. Every bite I took of the cookie, I got either chocolate chip, nuts, raisin in eachbite. So, so good! Rather than eating each cookie in one sitting, I managed to split it into thirds...so that gift box of 4 cookies lasted quite awhile.I am a cookie lover now! Levain you changed me! Looks like I can find you at my local Whole Foods--Thanks Levain!!"
7,"Chocolate chip walnut cookie was increChocolate chip walnut cookie was incredible back when I could eat gluten. So happy they made a gluten free version I can have now adays! Not as good as the original of course, but still great. 5 stars because levain is great food, but also a fun and unique experience."
8,"Oh my word I am speechless !  This cookie is everything and a bag of chocolate chips!  This is one of the most moist, tasty and savory cookies a cookie lover can have.  This chocolate chocolate chip was heaven and the packaging perfect.  I can't wait to try another flavor oatmeal raisin here I come"
9,"By far some of my favorites treats in New York! The line is always out the door (but no worries at the longest a 10-minute wait), but well worth it. If it's your first time I would go for the classic chocolate chip and double chocolate chip cookies. They're both amazing and I can't pick a favorite so I always get both and split and have the rest the next day, Be aware - they are a lot bigger than they look but definitely worth the calories."
10,The have the thicccccc cookies. I don't know how they make them so thicc. Highly recommend them no matter what time of the day and no matter what season!
11,"Warm, chocolatey, and definitely worth the hype!! The perfect treat after spending the day exploring the city."
12,What an incredible establishment. I'm going to keep this review short and sweet.. Try the chocolate walnut cookie. Hands down one of the best cookies I have ever had in my life.
13,"Mouth watering okey gooey cookies. I've had cookies like Levain before but never actually tried the real version. Hot off the press and a better take on the classic cookie. I undoubtedly appreciate a gooey cookie, one that oozes the minute you crack it and fills your mouth with a little warm cookie dough on the inside and a slightly crunchier outside. I love that Levain bakery has more than just your typical cookies, they also have pastries which look delicious. While I haven't tried the pastries, If they're anything like the cookies they would be outstanding. Levain offers a handful of flavors such as two chip, a their original which is walnut and chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin and dark chocolate peanut butter. I wanted to try them all but I opted for the original and Two chip. I would say that the original was my favorite of the two. It has that crunch from the walnuts and a delicate nutty flavor that pairs perfectly with the rich chocolate flavor."
14,"This place is amazing!Customer service was so welcoming.Such great flavor in their huge and delicious cookies, wow!When I looked at their cookies for the first time my mouth watered instantly.. I couldn't just settle for one flavor so we chose three and all were five stars. We got the chocolate chip walnut, oatmeal raisin, and double chocolate chip.There was no inside seating so we took our cookies and sat on a near by bench in front and dug in! It took us two full days to finish all three cookies because you get such a sugar rush from just a couple of bites!Before visiting my fiancé kept seeing these bags with Levain on it. He thought it was a jewelry store or something of that nature until I came across the place on my map. I guess it's really popular here and I'm glad I got to try it!"
15,"Levain is worth the hype and 100% worth a visit to if you're visiting NYC. I really, really like Levain. BUT it's not my favorite cookie in New York (see: Chip, Maman, Culture Espresso). The cookies are slightly crispy on the outside, extra chewy on the inside, and the best when served warm. They are absolutely massive and thus slightly undercooked on the inside."
16,"My husband and I came here to get the cookies! He's particularly obsessed with bitter and likes how the chocolate here isn't too sweet. He got the chocolate walnut cookie and I got the 2 chip cookie. He said mine was more bitter. I wish they had a milk chocolate option, but they're still very good, fresh, and warm!"
17,"I'm obsessed with this bakery!! Their cookies are to DIE FOR  Would definitely recommend sharing these cookies as they're so big and intense, but well worth it. One of the best bakeries on the UWS."
18,The BEST chocolate chip cookie I've ever eaten! Thick and gooey and rich and every bit worth the hype!!
19,"A nice thick doughy cookie if you don't like crispy/crunchy ones. I loved the chocolate chip walnut and the dark chocolate. It wasn't warm and gooey when I got it though, although the chocolate chips were semi-melted."
20,"As an entrepreneur, I appreciate great customer service first and foremost. I love the customer service at the Soho location. The store is well kept super clean and the entire staff is always working as a team. Often times employees are not aware but some of us watch The employees where we are spending our money. I have walked out of stores where there was no unity or teamwork. It makes consumers at ease to see teamwork. Susan at the Lafayette location helped us tonight she was super sweet. I would recommend this place to people who loves great baked goods and exceptional customer service."
21,We enjoyed this bakery a lot. Is it the best ever? That's hard for me to judge. I did eat the banana chocolate chip bread kinda quick and the cookies were thick and chock full of chocolate. We were lucky there was barely a line and it was the perfect late morning snack. Service was friendly and the coffee was delish. Prices were about what you would expect in the UWS. Definitely worth a visit!
22,These Cookies are Delicious!!!! It's a full meal..... There is no words for this But You must go and try for yourself.
23,"Want a gooey, chocolatey, sugary, cookie that will keep you craving more and more?'Nuff said. Go buy them. Even better, order them and save yourself the line. :)"
24,"Dulce de Leche cookies and cortado, do I need to say anything else? I love this place. The experience has been standardized and it is always great to have the same level of awesome customer service paired with their warm delicious cookies and coffee. You cannot miss this place."
25,"Stopped by Levain twice during my weekend NYC visit and I'm not even a sweets person. Cookies were warm and gooey in the center. You will definitely need coffee or tea to wash all the sweetness down. Also got a latte which I wasn't a fan of. It was super strong!! If you can handle a lot of caffeine then their coffee is for you. Brought a box of cookies back home to Cali and they stayed good for over a week in an airtight container. If you toss the cookie in the microwave for 10 seconds or so, they come out just like a fresh one. Gooey in the center and melted chocolate chips."
26,"I am ashamed to say that while I've heard of Levain before, I was not enticed to go try it until I watched that scene in TATBILB. And I was missing out!We came here on a weekday to get dessert after lunch and some coffee. We ate it before going to the museum. We just got their walnut chocolate chip cookie. It is a big cookie, so I would recommend sharing. It was hot and melted, so delicious but so sweet. I also ordered a coffee with milk. The staff is really nice and I love the branding of the store. There's also free postcards! I got to bring one home.I wish I came here with a larger group so we could try more cookies. Until next time!"
27,Cookie spheres. Nuff said :P really friendly staff and delicious sugar coma inducing cookies and pastries. Sort of New York prices but who cares.
28,"Going to keep this review short and sweet, unlike the long lines you might experience on the weekends. Large, crunchy on the outside and gooey inside cookies that are highly addicting. If you're a chocolate lover - definitely get the double chocolate cookie - but be warned, it's VERY chocolate-y. My favorite is the two chip, followed closely by the chocolate chip walnut cookie."
29,"When craving cookies make sure to go where you can appreciate the product. Double Chocolate Peanut Butter cookie taste BOMB when you pop it in the microwave for 10 seconds... Currently they only allow 4 people at a time, so you might walk up to a short but quick pace line. A whole in the wall well needed!"
30,"Cookies always on point. I had a double chocolate, the GOAT of their cookies. I've had slightly different cookies that I consider better. But this place rocks."
31,"There's a reason this place is so famous. Just go - you won't regret it. I've been to multiple locations and always have a consistent experience. The key is to get the cookies while they're fresh and hot! If you do not like doughy consistency with your cookies, then you won't like these. The cookies are pretty big and rich, so I can never eat a whole one in one sitting. I've ordered the: -Chocolate Chip Walnut: my favorite!-Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter: good, but oh so rich. -Oatmeal Raisin: my second favorite!"
32,"Delicious cookies with a crispy outside and soft & gooey (undercooked) inside!! Only tried the chocolate chip cookies, thought they were solid (amazing but not the best I've had). Always seems to be a line at this bakery, but on the plus side of that, the cookies are always fresh, and the line seems to move fast. Definitely worth a try!!"
33,"Omg wow, insanely good cookies. YummmmmmmmmmmmmMmmmmmmMmmmmmmMmmmmmmMmmmmmmMmmmmmm"
34,"Massive but delicious cookies. They lived  up to the hype for sure. I've seen these cookies with the dramatic videos showing people splitting them down the middle to reveal the melty and gooey chocolate chips. They looked so good but we are all the way on the West Coast... Fast forward a year or so, my cousins that live in Los Angeles now headed back home to NYC and brought us back some. I was grateful to finally get to try some of Levain's famous cookies. The chocolate chip walnut was so very good. The cookie batter was moist and the chocolate chips themselves were a great semi-sweet taste that every cookie should have. The oatmeal raisin is also very good. One of the better oatmeal raisin cookies I've had... The last one I tried was the dark chocolate with peanut butter chips inside them. This one wasnt as great as I'd hoped. It was too rich for me and my least favorite of the three I got to try. The first two were really good cookies. They are HUGE. The following week, I decided to order a signature cookie assortment for Levain to be delivered to my lady for our anniversary. It's a 4-pack of cookies for $27 + $19 for 2-day shipping. She got one each of Chocolate Chip Walnut, Dark Chocolate Chocolate Chip, Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Chip and Oatmeal Raisin. She was one happy camper when it was delivered at her work. It arrived as expected with a custom message on a postcard from me and was packaged well. I was happy with that online order and I'm glad I did it. I cant wait to go back to NYC so I can finally try Levain Bakery in person. The baguettes look so good. I gotta have em... Until then, I'm left with ordering the cookies."
35,"Simply the best chocolate chip cookie available anywhere. I had heard this before but had never tried, dissuaded by the lines outside. Now I know why people are willing to wait for these nuggets of perfection!"
36,If you want to try the best cookies then you have to go to Levain bakery. They have multiple locations so I'm pretty sure it won't be too hard to find. The cookies are pricey but they are pretty big so it's worth it. So good with some coffee/tea.
37,"I love this place, one of the best chocolate cookies ever, the blueberry taste very good too. Yum! Highly recommended! Enjoy :)"
38,"Living up to its iconic name of being gooy and a mountain of a cookie. Served nice and warm these cookies are a staple of nyc! Inside the store they have many workers taking your order and the line moves quite fast. They even have a water pitcher for those who might a refreshing drink. We tried the chocolate walnut and the dark choco with peanut butter. To start we tasted the dark choco one, which we thought had a good distribution of peanut butter chips making for that beautiful cross section photo. Although I wasn't expecting the peanut to be in the form of a chip it was yummy nonetheless.... a little on the sweet side for me personally. The choco walnut cookie was a little too sweet for my liking to order again but it was a solid cookie! Love walnuts in my baked goods :)"
39,"The best doughy, chewy, decadent cookies! The classic leaving cookie is the walnut chocolate chip. It's a big chewy cookie with an almost doughy center. The walnuts and chocolate chips are chunky and add so much! I highly recommend asking for the cookies to be warmed when you order. Also try to eat it quickly after purchasing! These aren't as good after a few hours, but when fresh they are heaven on earth.They also now have a gluten free option, which I was so happy about. I got a large oat milk cappuccino with my walnut chocolate chip gluten free cookie. Every bite was so rich and delicious. It's pretty decadent, so I usually save half of my cookie to finish slowly. My brother got an oatmeal raisin and a peanut butter chocolate cookie with a side of milk. He loved both cookies! I didn't try his, but they both looked great. He said the chocolate peanut butter was definitely more rich than the oatmeal."
40,Do yourself a favor and stop by one of the bakeries. My cookies are always warm and the chocolate chips always melt as I take bites. Extremely fluffy and soft. I always make sure to leave room to treat myself to them. Some of the best cookies I've had across the nation.
41,"Chocolate chip cookies in which to indulge. One is so good that you should tie yourself to your chair to keep from reaching for more.If you try once, you will be a repeat consumer, for sure."
42,let's say my husband and I walked for 40 minutes to get to the bakery. We ordered two chocolate chip walnut cookies and one oatmeal raisin. The cookies were huge and heavy my husband ate it really quickly within three minutes while I savor mine throughout the day because I know that it's really good and that it has a lot of calories. I was able to bring home one of the cookies to my daughter in San Francisco but she doesn't like oatmeal cookies so I happily eat it and savored it as well I am very happy that I was able to try the cookies and look forward to having it again when I'm in NYC
43,"Best cookies ever!! Warm, crunchy outside & soft in the middle with perfect sweetness."
44,"I was worried that all the hype around this place would set my expectations too high and leave me disappointed. But boy was I wrong. These cookies are phenomenal. Dense, rich, and well worth the $4.50 price point. I tried the chocolate chip walnut and oatmeal raisin and both were perfection. I'm pretty picky when it comes to cookies... but zero complaints to be had. I will 100% be returning. Thank you Levain!"
45,"Best efffin cookies hands down. I always go for the chocolate chip. Its like a good steak, you have the nice crisp exterior and soft like butter interior"
46,"I always look forward to coming to get Levain cookies when in town and once again this did not disappoint. Cookies were freshly out of the oven, nice and warm. Gooey on the inside with a little crunch around the edges. I recommend the two chip cookie but if you are okay with a nutty cookie, the walnut chocolate chip is the OG."
47,"After lunch @ Flushings we doubled back to Manhatten for some sweets, Levain was first on the hit list.We got 1 flavors of each and they were very good.  At $4.5 each these monsters were nearly the size of a muffin!  My fav was the 2 chip chocolate chip cookie, it was stuffed with so much chocolate its reminiscent of the chocolate custard fillings inside a French chocolate croissant.  At the hotel we microwaved it for 10 sec and they tasted even better.  My endocrinologist should be worried."
48,"Look, I'm all for long, descriptive reviews that will help you make informed decisions about where you do and how you spend your money but there's really only one word necessary for this place. DELICIOUS. spend the college fund. The house fund. The retirement fund. You won't regret it. So delicious. So good."
49,Was in town for a quick visit and had to stop by the famous Levain bakery. I was a little suspicious that it was maybe over hyped but I was not! We got two cookies and they were massive. Went with the classic chocolate chip and then a chocolate cookie with peanut butter and chocolate chips. Both were awesome and a little different. You could easily share one but who wants to do that.
50,"I have never been a big fan of cookie and came here mainly because of the hype. The cookie was good and met the standards. It was thick, soft on inside and crunchy on the outside. Would def recommend this place to cookie lovers. However if you aren't a cookie person, this won't be a place that changes you mind"
51,Love love the amount of chocolates in the cookie. Wow.  Worth the walk from midtown. Wish they had more shops.
52,"If you want thick luscious cookies that will put you into an amazing food coma for hours, then look no further. Levain bakery knows where it's at! Each bite is crunchy on the outside and yet soft on the inside; it always leaves you wanting more. A must try!"
53,"Their cookies are DELICIOUS!! It's thick, yet soft inside and crunchy outside. Definitely a must try!"
54,My only reservation is the price per cookie. But it's still a high recommendation for me. Those cookies are absolutely bomb!
55,"I am definitely a member of Levain Bakery fan club! Their cookies are the softest, gooey-est ever. Just the right amount of sweet, and the perfect texture. My favorite is the chocolate chip w/ walnut cookie. Best eaten fresh. If you end up not finishing your batch the same day (likely not), just warm it up in the oven for a few minutes and it will be perfect again."
56,"*Rating based solely on FOOD* Presentation: 5Texture: 2.5Flavor: 4Would return? No Must-try: Chocolate Peanut Butter Chip CookieDisclaimer: I'm a crispy cookie type of person, which is why I don't love the texture of these. The edges are crispy but the middle, even though slightly chewy, is almost raw. If you like softer cookies then you'll love these! The flavors are amazing - I tried all 5 flavors and the most original one is chocolate peanut butter chip, but if you don't like peanut butter you probably won't like it. Classic chocolate chip and double chocolate chip tasted great as well. I think some salt on top could be beneficial here for a more complex flavor. My least favorite one was oatmeal raisin - there was something off here. Hope this helps! Z."
57,This is my favorite cookie. The chocolate chip walnut. Why is this place not five stars? Do some people not like cookies? Do some people prefer cookies that aren't crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside? Maybe some people don't think waiting for food is ever worth it?
58,"I had high hopes for this place, especially with the ratings and the line. However, the cookies were way too soft for me. They were warm, which is granted with how many they need to churn out. The packaging, however, was great and is definitely a nice dessert gift."
59,"I definately undertand the hype around this bakery. Let's start by the cookies being massive so you definately get your money's worth. Next, they taste DELICIOUS!!! Worth the line and the wait."
60,"Crazy, crazy good. Close your eyes and picture the most perfect cookie....crispy on the outside, soft and creamy on the inside with warm oozing goodness from every nook and crannies. Imagine warm creamy peanut butter oozing out of a warm chocolate cookie. It's real, it's no longer a dream!!Unlike most commercial cookies, these are NOT too sweet, so they keep you wanting another bite, until it's gone and then you're very very sad. These cookies are served warm, as if they just came out of the oven. Perfection! Oh and they are ALL delectible! Yes, I've tried them ALL!"
61,"BEST COOKIES EVERRRRR. Chocolate walnut is my absolute fave. Whenever I try a new cookie spot, I always compare it to Levain."
62,"LEGENDARY upper west-side bakery cranking out consistently good big cookies. We came to ""the cookie place"" almost a decade ago visiting some friends and I still remember the name after the single cookie we ate. It's no small feat to be considered ""NYC's best cookie"" by so many reviewers and publications.Recently, my wife passed on a lot of our baby-stuff to a coworker w/ a newborn and they mail-ordered these cookies for us as an awesome thank you.Very easy to reheat, just 5-10 minutes at 350 degrees and you can preserve them for a long time in the freezer. One whole cookie is too much for one of us and we split 1 cookie between me, my wife, and our oldest as an occasional treat.The cookies are soft and gooey in the center, slightly under baked intentionally. They are a treat warm and we love it with coffee or milk to cut some of the sweet. All of them are also irregular and not perfectly shaped giving them a cool ""small-batch"" and home made feel.Our mail-order present had the iconic chocolate chip, chocolate, and peanut butter. All of which we recommend though my personal fav. was the peanut butter."
63,"Levain has absolutely monstrously thick cookies. The pictured offender was about the size of a baseball and took me the entire day to finish. It was also absolutely delicious. However, I would have preferred a slightly smaller cookie because I was unable to enjoy the entire thing fresh. 4.50 may seem expensive for a cookie, and it is, but these are very big cookies. My friend got the dark chocolate and it also looked really good but definitely less thick."
64,"This place is just way too good. I rarely eat cookies but this place just does it right. Also, it's so huge that one cookie can last like 4-5 snacks session.I definitely want to try all the flavors eventually too.Friendly staff, good price, and amazing cookies"
65,"Never disappointed by these cookies. 100% worth the the hype!! We always stop by here when we are on the Upper Westside. My favorites are either the classic walnut chocolate chip or the chocolate peanut butter, but you really can't go wrong with any of the cookies!"
66,The team at Levain are always friendly and the  chocolate chip walnut cookies are absolutely delicious!! What more could you ask for!
67,"THICK and GOOEY cookies! I have tried all their cookies and my favorites are the Chocolate Chip Walnut Cookie and the Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookie. You can't go wrong with any of their flavors. The perfect thickness and chubbiness, not overly sweet or bland.Hands down, favorite cookie place."
68,"Move over Insomnia Cookies.  Your competition has won. I order from here regularly. Yes, the cookies are expensive, but they are so delectably chewy, moist and rich, the price is worth it.My favorites are oatmeal raisin cookie and their original chocolate walnut."
69,I travel from jersey all the time to come get these cookies. The two chip chocolate chip cookies are my favorite and are the perfect snack when I need to indulge. They have a few bakeries scattered throughout the city and they all provide the same exceptional service.
70,"The food is amazing but the staff is appallingly rude. Like unapologetically, brazenly rude. You'll like what you eat but be treated very, very bad."
71,"We got the tickets for each person who entered for ordering meals. There's long line of customers and our line certainly not moving for more than 30 minutes, plus the customers in front us seemed continuously ordered stacks and stacks of sandwiches. And we finally get rescued when one of the staff reminded about their waited service, all you have to do was walk to the back of the restaurant and they're servers waiting for you, it was that's the best decision! We ordered the famous pastrami sandwich, matzo ball soup and frankfurter, the NY best natural casing all beef dog. All are deliciously juicy and perfect! Their cucumber pickles are very crunchy and refreshing. The restrooms checked was good, although it's hidden (read the signage on the back), some water splashed on the floor, just have to be careful with your steps around. It was a great experience to be in one of legendary list of restaurants with 132 years of life history!"
72,"After years of wanting to try this I finally did. This place did not disappoint. Pastrami is the best I've ever tasted and the quality is top notch. It melts in your mouth and it's hard to stop eating especially with the amazing pickles. This place is such a nice experience and I like how they give you a ticket to get your food and you pay after eating and feel like you're going back in time of the old days where this was the style. As for the bagels, it was so good I didn't have time to take a picture. Tip: Put some pastrami in the bagel and eat up. It's sooo amazing."
73,"This place is unapologetically oldschool and an embodiment of the New York character, and every minute of it is fantastic. You'll have to see it for yourself; you'll read other reviews of the staff being totally brazen; they're right, and good! it's absolutely fantastic. The sandwiches themselves are rather pricy but frankly half of one -- perhaps accommodated by other side items -- should be ample in satisfying a standard appreciate. And, I mean, the meat is great.They have a separate area where they'll wrap up your food if you give it to them -- I saved half for my hotel room, and without having heated it up or anything it might've been the best cold leftovers I've had in my life. Somehow, I think I enjoyed eating cucumbers with a meal for the first time in my life. Did I say the meat was great? Because it is. My god"
74,"Come early to avoid long lines. Sandwiches are available even early in the morning! Pastrami is tender and flavorful. Worth coming at least once for their big Pastrami sandwiches. They asked if we wanted a table with service. She took us passed everyone and seated us (in the back smaller room). Waiter came to the table for our order. Need to pay at the counter in the main room (left side for cash; right back area if credit card)Homemade Matzo Ball Soup has 1 big tender matzo ball that can easily be cut into with a spoon. Chicken soup is slightly salty with bits of carrots and celery that were tender with still some texture $8.95Homemade ColeSlawis loose and adds a lot of creaminess for a good  sandwich$7.45Potatoe Latkes (6 halves) w/ sour cream & applesauce. Dense $13.95.  3*Hot Potatoe Knishhas a fluffy interior $5.953 Meat Platter with pastrami, brisket & corned beef is big enough to feed at least 3 people. Comes with a tower of light rye bread slices (12 cushy fresh halves) and a plate of pickles (bright ones were briny & salty; darker ones were 2x as salty) $41.95Pastrami is moist, tender, flavorful & not that saltyBrisket is tender & not that saltyCorned beef is a thicker cut, slightly salty, & almost as tender as the others Katz's Pastrami Sandwich big enough for 2 to share or 1 very hungry $24.95Black & White Cookie tender cookie with vanilla and chocolate icing $4.25Locatedon SW corner of E Houston St & Ludlow St-1 block west of Essex St -3 blocks north of Delaney St (Tenement Museum)-1mi NE of Manhattan Bridge"
75,"Sunday around 10 AM had quite a line out the door and around the corner. They were not offering table service on this day. Once we were in the door, lines at the stations were also quite long. We waited about 20 minutes to get to the counter and were able to order! Hand your ticket over the counter and they'll track all the items you purchase. Made sure to hold onto all of the tickets you have, you'll need them on the way out. after you're done eating you can pay with card at the back or pay cash up front. Paying with card you'll present your receipt at the front. This really was the best pastrami I've ever had. Perfectly seasoned and so tender. Quite pricey at $25 a sandwich, but it was an experience!"
76,Ok so I know that a pastrami sandwich is now $24.95. Overpriced ... sure it's NYC and it's the famous Katz's deli. Now you can buy and sit down after but it's very casual. I got there early like 11-12 noon and no line thank god! The Guy who made was sandwich was easy on the eye. I enjoyed watching him make my sandwich . now I know $24.95 is a lot for a sandwich but holy moly it's large . Had two meals with it. I asked for extra mustard and delicious pickles came on the side. Definitely need a doggie bag to take home
77,"I went on a Saturday for lunch, and for it being close to Russ&Daughters it was a tourists dilemma on which to choose to eat! The line was quite long and it passed the CVS doors IIRC, but it moved really fast. When you get in, you're given a ticket you should keep since that's how you'll pay, but I'm not sure why they gave everyone one. I got 3 sandwiches amongst adults, and we had some leftovers. We got the famous Pastrami (best one), Reuben, and Roast Beef sandwiches. The sandwiches, although super pricey at $25 a pop, was really flavorful, fresh, and tender. As we watched our server cut the beef, he gave us multiple free samples of each meat we ordered as a taste, and asking us if we liked it to continue with the order, which was really nice! I've also read other reviews on less friendly servers, so I guess it just depends on who you line up for once you get in. You also get free cucumbers and pickles if requested! I though the sandwiches were a little on the saltier side, but the cucumbers were able to neutralize the salt. I probably wouldn't come back here if I were ever in NYC again, but it's definitely a must try on any list of NYC foods bucket list!"
78,Finally made my way to trying this famous deli in NY and I was very much worth the wait. In fact I can't wait to go back to NYC to have a pastramis sandwich from Katz.We ordered the classic Katz pastrami hot sandwich and also a bagel breakfast pastrami sandwich. They were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. It really is in fact the best pastrami sandwich I've ever had in my life.
79,"Came by March 2022 on a Wednesday, waited in line for about 10 min, there were 2 couples ahead of me. Will was the person preparing my sandwich, I saw guys with the thicker looking bread and wanted to try it this way. I had it with Rye a few years ago, but I don't like Rye. I got the pastrami sandwich with the garlic bread and added cheese. When I say I was shocked at how delicious it was, I was having a pleasurable moment with this beautifully crafted sandwich. I don't know if it's the way Will cut that smoked pastrami, or the love he had when he stuffed that soft garlic bread with all that meat and cheese and just added love into it, but I was in food heaven when I ate into this. I added more table side mustard (because I love mustard)  and it just made it even more special. The pastrami was tender, flavorful and seasoned just perfectly. Not salty at all. I remember it being salty 5 years ago, but nope, not this time. It was delicious. The layers of meat, bread and cheese was perfect. Soft, tender, juicy, it was filling. One sandwich is definitely enough for two people. I couldn't finish one half (I also just ate a Levain cookie about 30 min prior too)Definitely taste it. It's delicious. Grab a ticket when you walk in, walk up to one of the sandwich prep guys and wait in line to order your food, get drinks and side after and they fill your little ticket. You sit down and enjoy your food, then pay when you leave. Easy, simple. The crowd is a lot better now. 5 years ago it was packed and difficult to find a spot to sit and eat. It's definitely worth it!"
80,"I've made numerous Katz's visits. But this was the first time for my Mom, which stunned me. She asked for waiter service, which I didn't expect. For me, it's all about ordering a sandwich at the counter and watching the cutter do the carving. That said, I wasn't going to argue. But we waited 20 minutes on line to get a table and we split two sandwiches. One was a pastrami with Swiss cheese and mustard, I mean, you can't come here and not get pastrami. We also got roast beef with dressing from a country in Europe and Asia that I won't identify, along with Swiss, lettuce, and tomato. Unbelievably great, the quality of the meat is simply the best in the world. I just wish the rye bread had a little more crust or some caraway seed for that extra texture. The potato salad was a little too creamy for my taste, but adding a little salt, pepper and mustard did the trick. With the pickles, I prefer the full sours here, which is odd for me, I've always been a half sour fan. But these half sours taste like cucumbers more than pickles. And again, the rye bread needed caraway seeds and crunch. I've seriously had better rye bread in LA.But the waiter service... don't do it. Ours never checked on how our food tasted and was very slow with drink refills. Also they didn't tell us that the counter at the door is cash only, so mom had to walk towards the back to pay via card. The bussers are awesome, they work quickly and are super friendly."
81,"What a zoo in here. We had to wait in line for 20 minutes before finally getting inside on a Sunday afternoon. Once inside, they give you a ticket that you must keep so that they staple the receipt to and show on your way out. Oh brother! Do they really have that many people ordering food and not paying to warrant this crazy security measure?!At any rate, once we got inside, it was another 15 minute wait to get a table. FYI, the When Harry Met Sally sign pointing to where it happened is no longer over an actually table, just a spot on the floor. One we sat, the server greeted us in about 10 minutes and took our order. All sandwiches are $24 and up. All you get with them is a plate of dill and garlic pickles. For lunch, we went with a sandwich of half brisket and half pastrami on rye. It was good, with lots of meat, but the rye bread had nothing on it. It was just bread and meat. Adding their brown mustard on the table helped give it some wetness. Overall the meat quality was top notch, the the pastrami having some nice bark on it. The brisket meat was softer than the tougher pastrami meat. To drink, we ordered the Pilsner beer (too bitter for me) and a chocolate egg cream drink which tasted like a very watered down chocolate milk. We also had a vanilla egg cream which tasted a bit better, but still very thin and watery."
82,"I was getting an itch.  A travel itch again and went back to New York City in November 2021 for a quick 3 day weekend trip.  I went with a friend, and it was his first time in New York City, so I wanted to show him the NYC basics.One of the definites is at Katz's Deli.  We tried Pastrami sandwich, potato salad, and pickles.  Generally speaking, I am not a fan of pickles, but I liked the pickles where (that were more bright green).  Definitely a fan!  #WhenHarryMetSally #NYCMustHaves"
83,My daughter said dad we need to hit that Katz's again before we fly home and hey I'm not one to say no to that deliciousness. We jumped on the subway and made our way down to this famous institution and had an awesome lunch.  It was packed to the gills and the line was down the street.  It took about 30 minutes for us to make it inside and get our carver. Oh man this place is fantastic and has ruined me on pastrami now.  Oh I can't wait until I'm back in the city and get me another sandwich
84,"This was an experience like none other. The famous Katz's Deli which I had come to know about through Food Network, is an absolute MUST visit. The place yields a line outside the door & is bustling with excitement once you enter. When you are in line you are offered a sample of your choice meat. And you have an opportunity to ask the preparer questions. (You'll want to ask questions!) For the record I have NEVER indulged in a pastrami sandwich that was so delightful. From the first bite you are hooked with no turning back. I don't know if you can actually finish a sandwich in one sitting as it is enough for 2 people. I'm going to go on record and say it doesn't get any better than this. They are famous for a reason. The interior walls showcase all the celebrities that have graced the establishment. Ample seating allows you to bask in the culture of this place. Every time I'm in New York I will visit Katz's. Absolutely OUTSTANDING!!"
85,"Yesterday my husband and I ended up at the famous Katz Delicatessen. Upon walking in you're given a ticket stub for staff to write your running total on and you're ushered into a line. I can't eat pretty much anything there because of the gluten, so I got a $3.95 beef hot dog with sauerkraut, sans bun, while my husband got a pastrami sandwich. At $24.95 for a sandwich with no sides (except a quartered pickle spear) I thought it was a rip off.Not only is their food overpriced, I had to stand in a separate line from my husband to order my hot dog and if we wanted sides or a drink, we'd have to stand in another line again. Then you have to stand in line to trade your running tab ticket for a reciept. Then you stand in a check out line with your receipt to pay. Too much standing around waiting. It took at least 35 minutes to get 1 sandwich and hot dog. My food was cold by the time my husband got his food and we didn't want to wait in another line for a side of fries. This is an a**backwards way of ordering food that is costing them sales. I would not recommend."
86,"Came here with 1 other person on a Sunday afternoon at around 2pm. They really need to redo this line system. I waited on 7 lines total. One to get in. One to get food (some lady ordered literally one of everything in front of me), one to get drinks, one to get sides, one to go to the bathroom, one to pay (no signs for where to pay cash or card, come on folks), then another to pay card, then finally one more to leave. Absolute rip off too. $45 for 2 drinks, fries, half sandwich, matzo ball soup. Won't be coming back. Fix your system."
87,"There's no other place I've ever been to in my life that has a better pastrami sandwich then Katz deli.  Been going there since I was a little girl when my dad would bring us to get the pastrami sandwich and the big fat steak fries served in a paper bag.  Nothing has changed about the atmosphere or decor in all those years and I love it.  I hope they never change anything about it no matter how old or run down looking it may become.  The servers cut the meats right in front of you and let you taste in hopes for a small tip. Although the price has gone up considerable, its worth it.  If you've never been there, you must make sure you go.  Whether you are a visitor from another state or country or just a native New Yorker, everyone should visit Katz at least once.  I promise it won't be your last visit."
88,Order:- Pastrami Sandwich (4/5)- Matzo Ball Soup (2/5) Pros:- the pastrami is so juicy and tasty- friendly staff Cons:- if you lose your ticket you have to pay $50 - the Matzo Ball soup tasted like I was eating a sponge in salty water Overall: Heard lots about this place from friends and the internet. The sandwich was yummy and the cashier told us to switch the rye bread for club and add swiss cheese. There was lots of meat packed into the sandwich but I wish there were more vegetables/chilis in it. Definitely a place to visit in NY but I would not go again. Especially since it's ~$25 for a sandwich.
89,"Had a pastrami sandwich, a chopped liver with onion side, and some coleslaw Doordashed (or equivalent) to my hotel not too far away and loved it.  Real NY Jewish deli food.  Great quality.  That order, btw, was more than enough for two not super hungry people."
90,"I have dreamed about going to Katz's deli for years! Since I was a kid. We'll 2022 I finally got to go! & man Leme tell you Katz's deli doesn't need this review, but I'm gonna write a short one anyways. F...kin amazing! Best pastrami sandwiches you'll ever have in your life! If you go to NYC and don't get Katz's deli you might as well not even go. Huge sandwich! OG Pastrami & The Rueben sandwich also amazing and sooo good!  If you haven't been do not skip Katz deli on your NY trip! Make sure you make time to go!"
91,"So many good reviews for their pastrami sandwich so you know I had to come here to try it. Luckily for us, there was no line at all so we got in and out pretty quickly. I was a little confused at how this place operates but follow the signs and you won't be too lost.We got a pastrami sandwich to share between 2 and holy moly, this sandwich is huge! It's jam packed with meat but that's what I would expect for a $25 meal. The pastrami is so tender and juicy and not overly salty. The only thing that I didn't like about the sandwich was the bread. I wish it was a different kind of bread or if it was toasted because the bread it came with kind of fell apart while you're eating it. I also loved the sides of pickles! Overall, I would definitely recommend trying this sandwich at least once in your life if you're ever in NY!"
92,"My friends wanted to order Katz's, so I decided to give it a try too. I recommend ordering online and then coming to pick up at your designated time. Although when we arrived, we had to wait about 10 more mins since they were quite busy.The sandwich is loaded with pastrami, so definitely shareable between two people. I thought the overall taste was okay, but I didn't love it. For such an expensive sandwich (~$25), the taste didn't wow me, it was pretty much just pastrami on rye bread with mustard and two pickles. If you like pastrami and want to cross this off your bucket list, go for it. If not, definitely skip."
93,"Katz's has been open since 1888 and for good reason - the food is outstanding. My friend and I took a quick trip to New York City  in January. We both agreed that Katz's was a must visit so we trekked here on a Monday night for dinner. I decided to go with the brisket sandwich, a plate of latkes for us to share and matzo ball soup. My friend traded his half of the pastrami sandwich for my brisket, a great trade as both sandwiches were delicious. The food was incredible and we were so glad we skipped lunch since we couldn't have any more to eat. The staff here is beyond friendly and couldn't be more welcoming. They probably knew we were a bit lost since this was our first time visiting (we watched YouTube videos to look like we knew what we were doing - of course I still was awkward). I would highly recommend Katz's to anyone visiting New York and I can't wait to come back when in town!"
94,"I love pastrami rachel sandwiches and I've yet to find anyone in the big apple that does it better than Katz's. Indeed, there's a reason this deli is universally celebrated. The mounds of luscious pastrami, the pillowy soft slices of fresh rye bread, the gobs of melted Swiss cheese, the creamy Russian dressing, and the crunchy coleslaw. It just hits different. To quote another New York icon, ""and if you don't know, now you know."" Bottom Line: a mecca that's worthy of a pilgrimage and a masterpiece that's worthy of a crown. Highly recommend."
95,"Despite living in NYC for a few years I had never tried Katz's. The long lines and crowds of tourists honestly felt a little intimidating.However, after trying it for the first time I can see what the fuss is all about. While the lines are long they move pretty fast. When you enter you have to make sure you go to the corresponding line (sandwiches, hotdogs, French fries etc.) The sandwich lines are typically the longest but before you know it you're at front and I loved that they give you samples of the meat as they prepare the sandwich.We order the combo sandwich with pastrami and brisket, fries, and a hotdog. The pastrami was definitely the star of the show as well as the full sour pickles. The portions are huge and great for a filling lunch while site seeing downtown!"
96,"I promised BF I'd take him to get pastrami in NYC. Since Carnegie Deli, the only NYC pastrami place I've been to before, was permanently closed, I made sure Katz's was on our schedule. Plus, for this BTS fan, it doesn't hurt to come to find their framed photo on the wall with the Katz's owners.We arrived on a super rainy night, so the line at 7 pm was pretty minimal. You order first at the counter, taste a sample of the meat you're ordering, and then choose your seat at any table to wait until your food is ready to be picked up.We went big and ordered both the pastrami and brisket! BF got a Katz ale to go with his meal while I got a diet Dr. Brown black cherry soda. Our meal overall cost $60.50, but it was soooo worth it. Mmmm, soooo good!I was sad to leave, thinking that it'll be a while before tasting Katz's again, but later I found out they do deliveries nationwide, like of their Katz's Birthday Box! Guess what BF is getting for his birthday!"
97,"The wait is long, but it's a million times worth the wait. Giving this place anything less than 5 stars would be a crime. I've been coming to eat here with my family since I was a kid & every time, it never disappoints. I mean, there's a reason why it's been in business for almost 134 years. It's an iconic staple of NYC & it always will be. My aunt and uncle took us here this time. So, my boys and my husband got to try it for their first time. My brother, his girlfriend and their kids got to try it too. Everyone was satisfied and everyone was impressed. The pastrami is known as, ""the best pastrami in the world."" Honestly, out of all the pastrami I've eaten, I'd have to agree. The matzo ball soup is also very good! Everything is good! You just can't go wrong here. If you look around, nothing about it has changed over the passed century and that's because it doesn't have to. You will see photos of celebrities and presidents who have been there. The film, ""When Harry met Sally"" was filmed there. I mean this is it, folks! Now, go get yourself a pastrami sandwich on rye or on club bread and call it a day!"
98,"Some say its Liebman's Deli in the Bronx, LA claim it's Brent's or Langer's but they are all wrong =b... No one tops the 134 year old pantheon of pastrami perfection that is Katz's.Note: This is a mail order review.HAWAII YEEPS, FREE SHIPPING!!! (for orders $100+).The heavenly pastrami is beautifully brined to impart a solid salinity before being dry rubbed with all the familiar spices, smoked, steamed, sliced, then vacuum sealed. Sous vide the packet or simply re-steam it and you have the same juicy, mouthwatering greatness sans the ""NYC hospitality"".Want to control the texture or salinity and want to slice your own? Buy the whole (roughly 4, 5, 6 lbs $90 - $120). These require three plus hours of additional boiling at home before serving. Having purchased it both ways, the whole is simply more fun.Want a Reuben? The corned beef is outstanding as well. Unlike pastrami, this is NOT smoked. It is also shipped sliced and vacuumed sealed with all the great flavor and ease of reheating as the sliced pastrami.Don't forget the hot deli mustard and pickles. A jar of full sour and crisp, snappy half sour make the experience complete.Other Jewish deli staples? Let's just say the jarred chopped liver and whitefish salad will transport you right back to the city.Best part, what you get in the deli is what you get at home. No altered recipes, no added preservatives (the chopped liver and whitefish have three and seven day expiration dates from the date of shipment).Thermal insulated boxes keep everything at temp. Rapid shipping. Zero problems.The world made smaller. Just another positive of the pandemic. Cheers."
99,"My life will never be the same! Ok so we all heard about Katz's deli. It's tradition, but it's more than that! That pastrami was heavenly and the best i've ever had. I love delis so much that I would probably have my wedding in one! I got the pastrami add coleslaw and mustard! It was a dream that I never wanted to wake up from! We thought tourist trap don't go to certain places---well i pray i am trapped inside Katz's for eternity!"
100,"The BEST pastrami sandwich EVER!!! We didn't have to wait too long to get in, but we do have to wait in line to order. Their system seems pretty organized because you're given a ticket number to hold onto until the end to pay--so DONT lose it! There is a fee that's pretty hefty to pay for a lost ticket. Tables were open seating, and it seemed like there were plenty for newcomers since the turnover rate for seats were short. Staff seemed pretty friendly based on my own experience but I can tell things can get a little crazy due to the high volume of customers they get. So the food, I'll just get too it! We got the pastrami on rye sandwich and holyyyyy it was the most tender, flavorful sandwich I ever had. It's nothing like anything I've ever had in California. Very simple looking spread, meat, cheese and bread with a side of pickles, but this sandwich packed a WHOLE lot of savory goodness. We ordered just one because it was definitely enough to you share if you're trying to leave room for other food throughout the day, but honestly this was filling for the both of us. I wish I had this one last time before I left New York, but I will definitely be back for this whenever I'm in town again."
101,The best sandwich spot in NYC hands down!!!!Been coming here since I was a kid and this place still gives me those memories.
102,"FIRST TIME IN NYC~!The number one thing all my friends told me I had to eat for my first visit to NYC, was Katz. We got extremely lucky during our visit, the line was not as crazy long as I thought it would be! We waited only 15-20 minutes (which wasn't bad at all) and we even scored seating inside! We ordered the Katz's Reuben ($25.95) with Pastrami ($1). This classic sandwich was of course made to perfection with loads of delicious Meat, Swiss, Russian & Kraut and served with a side of pickles. The meat they serve here is so moist, tender and full of flavor. To be completely honest, I have never had a sandwich this good before!A huge MAHALO to Katz for serving delicious food for all these years!"
103,"I nearly cried when I realized that I never tried Katz's when I was super nostalgic for New York. Now thanks to mail-order, their Corned Beef and Pastrami are suddenly within reach. I got a big box. Of everything I could ever want to try, and I regret nothing. The sandwiches on their fluffy rye bread, covered in their mustard, sauerkraut, and creamy Russian dressing are awesome, pulled together by a super-sour pickle. The Hot Dogs are also awesome, and that all-beef frank that extends past the bread so you get some with every bite.Square Knishes rule, paired with Salami soft and hard. Less-known is the Knoblewurst, a big-beef sausage, seasoned much like a kielbasa with a little less salt and big bite of garlic. You can taste the quality of the meat, and it's best when cut in half and seared. Throw it into a bun or build it on a bagel for breakfast. They also make fabulous bagels, btw. Kugel makes a fantastic side, and you can just pop the whole tray into the oven like that. Theirs is more sweet with sugar and cinnamon, as well as pineapple and orange, but I confess it doesn't reheat that well. I've always loved Jewish delis, and Katz is the ultimate OG. I've had some pretty close contenders, but it's hard to compete with Katz."
104,"I love Pastrami and I have tried pastrami sandwiches from different places and different states, and nothing tastes better then Katz! First, when you arrive at Katz, expect a line, but the line moves fast.  Also, due to Covid, you need to be vaccinated, and show your vaccination card to get inside the restaurant.  Once you are in, you can get on line, order your sandwich and if you choose to dine in, just find an empty table to enjoy your meal.  there is a separate station to order your drink and another separate station to order desserts.  The place is always packed, but the lines moves pretty quickly.  From my experience everyone was very friendly. Now as for the food.  I have never gotten any other sandwich beside the pastrami.  When you place your order, they give you a sample of the meat.  And they are pretty generous on the meet on the sandwich.  A whole sandwich is a pretty good size that will fill you up but you will still want more, because the meat is sooo good.  In other places pastrami meat is really salty but at Katz, its just perfection.  We also got the chocolate Babka, which is basically a chocolate bread.  We ended up getting a loaf, because they ran out of slices.  If you warm it up for few seconds in the microwave the chocolate just melts.  Its just pure delicious. Cant wait to go back! If you love pastrami, and in NYC you HAVE to try Katz!  Also, Katz deliver anywhere in the country, which is always a plus!"
105,"Exceptional pastrami, but even more impressive was the service. Oftentimes when restaurants reach legendary status the service takes a nosedive. I've always found the rude New Yorker stereotype odd. That's never been my experience after countless trips to New York. The sandwich preparer smaller talked enough to be welcoming, but no too much to be annoying. Top 3 pastrami sandwich I've had. For $28 I expected nothing less."
106,"There are those rare occasions where a place lives up to the hype. Katz's is it.I've known about this place for years, but never made the time to try it out. Finally, I decided to put it on my Food Bucket List. There is something so satisfying about checking things off.Katz' pastrami on rye was fantastic. We have good pastrami on rye in the SF Bay Area. But, this was on another level. I only had a half sandwich, along with a bowl of split pea soup (what a combo!). I cursed myself after taking the first bite for being too lazy to try Katz' before. My huge loss. It was the best pastrami I've eaten--and I've eaten a lot of pastrami.I paired my NY favorite with a chocolate egg cream. Bada-bing. I see lots of reviews about the customer service. First-timers would do well by understanding the protocol. Know what you want BEFORE getting to the cutter. Read other reviews, watch YT reviews and talk with others who have eaten there before. This is not the place where the cutter is going to help you decide. Preparation is the key.That being said, they make darn fine sandwich."
107,Came all the way from Florida to visit the famous Katz's Deli. pastrami sandwich was to die for.
108,"First time to New York...yes, I stop by Katz after watching many publicity videos and reviews on the place.  The pastrami was tender...the most tenderness I have ever had, I will give them that, but it was not the best pastrami sandwich I have ever had.  I was hoping for it to be more stronger in flavor...to really provide a smokey strong pastrami flavor.  Katz did not deliver in the flavor.  Oh, and the sandwich is $25!"
109,"My wife and I visited NYC earlier this month and had lunch one day at Katz's Delicatessen.  The 30 minute wait in line was quite pleasant as we talked with others waiting.  Once we entered the door, we were mesmerized by their cutters and the ease in which the shuttle people through.Angie and I shared a pastrami on rye, matzah ball soup, a knish, and pickles.  This was the BEST sandwich I've ever had in my life and 2nd place isn't even close.  There is a reason this iconic deli has been in business since 1888!  The matzah ball soup was so comforting and reminded me of chicken and dumplings.  This meal was so epic, we actually ordered one of their sandwich kits the week of Christmas so our son could try the pastrami!  I foresee us ordering a kit every December if we can't make it to the city.  If you're visiting the city, this is a MUST have meal!"
110,"This is the original Halal Guys food truck - tried the chicken platter from here and it was delicious! They give really generous portions of rice and chicken, signature red/white sauce, and veggies and pita bread. Cash only, but it's a very efficient operation - walk up, order, and pay, and your meal will be quickly packaged and handed to you within a few minutes. We took our dinner nearby and sat down to enjoy our hot, delicious food. Definitely recommend stopping by here if you're in the area and trying to get to your next stop in New York City!"
111,"Seriously the BEST EVER!! For only $9, you can get a large bowl of food that tastes so good. This is the best bang for your buck you can possibly find in New York City. I am from Los Angeles and I must say the original halal guys in NYC from the cart tastes so much better than the halal guys chains here in LA. The nyc cart location gives you more meat and rice whereas the one in LA gives me more lettuce lol.. The meat also tastes much better here, it's nicely seasoned and cooked so well. I also recommend that you get the baklava here. It's so good! Can't wait for my next visit to NYC because this will definitely be one of my first stops."
112,"Used to be amazing. Regardless everyone should try this place once and come up with their own decision. However, I think I've had it for the last time. The taste that made them famous in my book isn't there anymore. Thankful for being able to experience them before they were as large as they are now. Tastes more like a commercialized product now.I understand that maybe nothing has changed from my first time to now but that's solely my opinion of the food now."
113,"I expected to really enjoy this. Of course there are a ton of halal carts in Manhattan, but this one is I believe one of the more popular ones. They were setup for a crowd/line, though when I arrived at about 11AM on a Friday, there was no line. I bought a combination platter with rice, lettuce, chicken and beef. It comes with a hot sauce and white sauce (like ranch) on the side. The hot sauce was too spicy for me, though was fine. I just wan't into the food. I found it to be sort of bland. I'd suggest trying something else."
114,I order once for this place with really high expectations. Chicken and rice is pretty hard to mess up. Oh boy it was terrible. It lacked flavor I was so disappointed.
115,"We used to be customers of them for quite a long time, but our last take out disappointed us big time.The food didn't taste as it was before. It was just average, nothing special at all.We used to drive to Manhattan from Brooklyn just to have their gyro. Not anymore . It seems that they got their fame and don't take care anymore. Sad to lose favorite place."
116,"Love this place, good food, nice staff. I recommend the combination plate. Real meat with authentic sauce"
117,"PRE-COVID REVIEW: OMG the OG Halal Guys?! While planning our trip to NYC my boyfriend and I knew we had to stop by where The Halal Guys first started. The first time we had Halal Guys was in Southern California at their Costa Mesa location. Of course, we loved it! Which is why we needed to visit their food truck location in NYC! Glad we checked it off of our list. There was a long line, but it moved quickly. Which is great because it was pretty cold in December haha. Got what we usually get (Beef Gyro Platter) and it was just as delicious as we knew it would be! Always love their white sauce and try to go easy on the red sauce since it can be spicy. Even though we won't be around to support their NYC locations, we'll do our part by supporting the Halal Guys here in California! :)"
118,"I'll start this by saying I've had Halal Guys no less than 50 times at minimum. I love it and the quality/taste is usually amazing. A few weeks back my SO had a bug in his beef platter. He waited to tell me to not ruin my food so we don't have a pic of it. We understand things happen with them cooking the food outside so we moved on.Tonight, however, I found a large piece of plastic in my platter (see picture). We've been coming here for at least 10 years and have only had issues like these with the food recently."
119,"We grew up in NY eating Halal Guys after clubbing, late night drives out to the city in the summer nights. Since then, they've expressed into an empire, with new locations, everywhere. Everyone was so happy for them, and excited to find halal guys In their town. So last night I had a one night stay in the Sheraton NY and was soooo excited because halal guys is down the block. There was a short line. I ordered the combo over rice. The guy who took my ordered yelled my order to the guy at the end. Who seemed unsure. And he said a few other things in their language. So they gave me my food very quickly. I went back to my room and found my food cold. I ate it anyway. The meat tasted pretty horrible and super dry. The pita was hard and cold. The rice, cold. I was so disappointed because they lost quality and care. So whatever, I go to sleep, I wake up a few hours later with the worst food poisening of my life. I was throwing up by myself in this hotel room. I didn't have anything to help with the nauseousness. I couldn't go out to buy anything cause I felt so weak. I had cold chills. As I'm writing this, this evening, just thinking about the food and smell makes me sick again. I'm so sad a childhood staple has gone to garbage. I will never eat anything halal again in my life."
120,"We love love love this place!We live in CA and go to B&S every time we visit NYC. We're glad to see they're open in the evening now, so we can enjoy their deserts. The only downside is that they open too late even for a tourist's breakfast. I also wish they had more seating room."
121,"Happened upon this place a couple blocks from our hotel when we were visiting NYC for spring break in March. We actually came back a couple of more times, it was that good!Also got their Caramel Bourbon Latte, if they still have it, you have to try it. So good!You cannot go wrong at this place, keep in mind it can get a little crowded when a rush comes in but if you go early enough, you'd be in and out!"
122,"Bibble & Sip always has the cutest desserts. I usually come here for the cream puffs but they were sold out for another hour l. My friend and I got the Raspberry Lychee tart, Lucky Hazelnut, and Panna Cotta. All were not overly sweet and were beautifully decorated. We came at 4:30 pm on a Sunday afternoon and the line was not too long and moved really quickly. Would recommend this place to everyone to try!"
123,"I went to NYC and saw these desserts and knew I had to try them. The pastries were adorable and tasted delicious. We sampled the hazelnut one. I would definitely give this 5 stars, but I didn't enjoy the coffee. I got the cold brew with the salted foam; the cold brew unfortunately was slightly sour, which ruined the taste. I would definitely go back to try more desserts and some more of the coffee!"
124,"Amazing amazing cream puffs! I heard about Bibble and Sip from a friend who used to live in NY. I stopped by once at 6pm on a Wednesday and there was a long line, no seating, and they were sold out of all cream puffs! Luckily the apartment I'm at is just a few blocks away so I made another trip on a Friday at 11:30am. There was no line and plenty of cream puffs but the cafe seating was all filled. I got an earl grey and a brown sugar boba milk tea cream puff. Both were delicious! The puff is flaky, buttery, and crispy (not stale or chewy at all), and the whipped cream inside is light, airy, not too sweet, and deliciously flavored! The earl grey has a delightful light tea scent. The boba puff is filled with boba pearls and the cream is a milk tea flavored cream on top of the puff. So delicious! I want to try the other flavors."
125,"This was the perfect pastry spot to go to for a quick pick-me-up after I finished up work on hump day. I hear they're known for their cream puffs here. There weren't many options left (really wanted to try the matcha or earl grey cream puff but they were out!) but I was able to get a hojicha cream puff!The cream puff was pretty big and $4.25! For what it is, it's not that sweet which made it enjoyable and easy for me to wolf it down in under a couple minutes. The cream was light and super whipped like cloud, yet it had a strong hojicha flavor which was nice and roasty. The bun itself was pretty good as well but the winner was clearly the cream."
126,This place has been on my list for a long time and I was a bit disappointed with what I had. I ordered matcha banana pudding and the black sesame macaron. I have a big sweet tooth person but the pudding was so overwhelming even to me. The macaron was huge with mochi in the middle. I'd say it's just ok but can't justify the price.
127,"During my stay in New York, I visited this cafe twice in the morning to grab a coffee and a breakfast. Both of my experiences were spectacular and they have wonderful service and a beautiful cafe. The line is never too long if you get there earlier, but if you're there around 10 there might not be any seating in the cafe. It was raining pretty heavily while I was there, so outdoor seating wasn't an option. The first visit, I ordered a matcha cream puff and a cookies and cream puff. For the drinks I got a cold brew and a matcha jasmine latte. The cold brew is not sweet at all, and I would HIGHLY recommend sticking to their most popular drinks. For someone who thinks that normal coffee is usually very sweet, I ordered light sweetness. However, Bibble and Sip is one of the coffee shops that you should stick to 100% sweetness for. The cream puffs were delicious and very creamy and the matcha jasmine latte was delicious. There isn't a lot of sugar in the matcha and the tea is very present in the drink. On the second visit, I ordered the black sesame cream puff and the chocolate croissant with almonds. I also got a lavender latte and blueberry tea. Like I said last time, stick to their popular menu for the drinks, since the blueberry tea was completely unsweetened. It did have a very strong blueberry smell though. The lavender latte was delicious and creamy and the cream puff was great as well. The chocolate croissant was delicious too. Overall, I had a great experience. Some tips: stick to that popular menu, get there early, and keep in mind their drinks have very little sugar in them. Great cafe!"
128,"Very adorable cafe chain in Manhattan that creates Asian-focused desserts. Their best items are consistently the cream puffs. Each puff is about the size of a medium fist, and thoroughly stuffed with cream filling. I've regularly bought them for post-group dinners, and they are among the first to be consumed. Earl Grey Vanilla and Matcha are my perennial favorites. Their macarons are also elaborately decorated and adorable."
129,"I've been here at least 5 more times since my last review and most of the items I get are in the same family since they tend to run out of a lot of stuff by 5 or 6pm and I never get here earlier. But on my last Wednesday visit they actually had a lot of their tarts and croissant still so I got to try some new items.Samoas Tart: The coconut flakes go very well against the miso caramel. The filling is a very fluffy light coconut mousse. I really enjoyed the tart base which reminds me a bit of the Annie's gluten free chocolate graham crackers where that cocoa flavor is present but it's not overwhelmingly chocolate. It works well cause it doesn't overpower the sesame. Raspberry Lychee: The white chocolate mousse is light and not too sweet and it goes well against the juicy bits of lychee in the tart. I do wish the raspberries were a bit sweeter but it is winter so not quite the season.Garlic Cheese Bread: I haven't had many savory items from here but this was quite good. It reminds me of most Korean breads where the cream cheese has a sweet undertone despite it being a savory item. The actual cream cheese here is still pretty much in it's natural state but the bread itself has a sweetness to it along with the herbs. While the bread is more dry and dense, I actually enjoyed it since it was served with a pretty heavy helping of fluffy cream cheese.Last quick note about this spot and one of the reasons this is still one of my favorite bakeries is just their macarons. I am absolutely amazed at the technical perfection of the macarons here. Perfect texture, flavor, and decoration. From their actual individual macarons to the tiny ones they use to adorn their tarts. They are all so perfect and anyone who's made macarons knows that they are fickle so to be able to do so many decorated ones while maintaining flavor and texture just amazes me!"
130,"This is such an adorable cafe just a few blocks north from times square. Glad we came in on a Tuesday morning, no lines nor crowds, lots of space to chill and hang out. I ordered a Matcha Jasmine Latte and I enjoyed every single sip. The jasmine tea definitely stood out but not too overpowering, it blended in nicely with the matcha. I thought it was a very unique and special combination. But I think we can all agree that the highlight of this visit is their cute little pastry display. I tried a few of them coz I was very intrigued with the flavor selection. Each one were intricately made all the way down to the tiniest details. My favorite was the hazelnut (bunny looking one), the flavor reminded me of a Ferrero rocher chocolate. It has a chocolate cake base, vanilla bean mousse, hazelnut nougatine and chocolate ganache on top. Thinking about it still makes my mouth water. Highly recommend this place if you are in the area."
131,"I tried Bibble & Sip for the first time two years ago and knew I wanted to go back on a recent trip to NYC. We showed up a little after they opened and none of their cream puffs were out. When I asked about it, I was told they come out staggered throughout the morning and they'd all be available after 11 a.m. Having to catch a flight in the early afternoon, I didn't think I'd be able to make it back in time. I just got a lavender latte (one of the best I've had) for the time being and decided to go elsewhere for breakfast.I couldn't get those cream puffs out of my head, so we gave it another shot at 10 a.m. and thankfully they had a couple of them out! We grabbed the Earl Grey vanilla (tastes like Fruity Pebbles, I swear) and miso salted caramel. They're perfectly crunchy on the outside and GENEROUSLY filled on the inside. I also tried their Biggie macaron (black sesame cookies and cream), which was almost too cute to eat. The service was very friendly and definitely recommend making a stop here."
132,"Bibble & Sip is one of my favorite dessert spots in the city. The cream puffs are absolutely delicious. They have a large crispy, cookie-like shell with delicious cream filling inside.I went yesterday afternoon to pick up some cream puffs to bring over to a friend's house:- Earl Grey Vanilla Cream Puff ($4.25+)- Black Sesame Walnut Cream Puff ($6+)They place them nicely in cute Bibble & Sip boxes, so they're perfect for a little treat.Since I was short on time, I'd ordered in advance online for pick-up. It's a good thing I did, because the line was out the door.TIP: If you know what you want and don't want to wait in their long lines, order in advance online."
133,Perfectly delicious sweet treat that also delivers an aesthetic positive visual punch! I tried a few different things but id suggested sticking with their items inside the case.
134,"We were staying in Midtown and this bakery was right beside the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square location so it was definitely on my list of places to check out. BIGGIE MACARON - this is a cute Totoro-inspired macaron that I obviously only purchased because it was so adorable. It contains black sesame with cookies and cream ganache and was as delicious as I expected it to be.BLACK SESAME WALNUT PUFF - contains black sesame cream with walnut and black sesame praline and they did not skimp on the filling! It was absolutely divine and worth every single bite.""EVERYTHING"" CROISSANT - if you're not looking to satisfy your sweet tooth, then you can order this croissant that comes with sesame seeds and a bunch of other ingredients I forgot to write down along with a side of cream cheese or butter (can't actually remember which one it was). Points for creativity and additional points because the boyfriend actually liked it.You have the option of dining in or taking out and though we only stopped at a table so I could take pictures of the goodies, I especially did not appreciate being yelled at by what I can only assume was the store manager. I get that it is a pandemic and there are strict rules about dining guests being vaccinated, but there was absolutely no reason for us to have been yelled at when it was evident we were not planning on staying. We still handed over our vaccination cards but sincerely hope that we were the only patrons to have been treated this way as it was a pretty surefire reason for us to not return for the remainder of our trip.Still, the goods are delicious and well worth trying out at least once. I do hope for their sake that their customer service has improved since then!(25/100--2022)"
135,"B&S is a very busy cafe with the cutest pastries. Especially during the warm seasons. Many young people like to sit and chat then hang out here. It's like the only cute cafe in the area. It's a bit cozy but not too cozy and who hates llamas?!It's a nice cute interior. It's  the only cute spot in Hells Kitchen  However, the drinks need to be tweaked for better quality. I believe that unsweetened chai flavor is the most authentic IMHO. I took a chance and tried the new Rose Chai tea and it was wayyyy too sweet so the girl (Thank you) behind the counter offered to dilute it with more oat milk but sorry it was still too sweet but I still drank it. The hoji-cha cream puff was smooth on the inside and crispy on the outside and was pretty good."
136,"Come before opening if you don't want to wait in a long line! I came 5 mins before it opened and there was already a long line outside. Luckily I was able to grab a seat in the cafe/bakery. The desserts were just coming out so it was very fresh. The tarts and cakes are adorably cute and it also tastes amazing! I got Lucky Hazelnut (llama), lychee berry (piggy), and raspberry lychee tart (llama macaron on tart). It's very close close walk from Times Square (~5 mins)"
137,I really appreciate the creative bakery creations. Sometimes they lean a little too heavy into Earl Grey but that's fine because it's a good flavor. I think my favorite items from here is the Everything Bagel flavored croissant and the cookies and cream cream puff. Absolutely get their cream puff it's probably their signature menu item.
138,"The desserts are really cute here! They taste just as good, too.I got a raspberry lychee pastry during my latest visit (~$9). I appreciated that there were actual fruit pieces in the pastry, and not purely flavoring.I came later in the afternoon but they still had plenty of cute desserts left to pick from."
139,"What a delight! I ordered a lavender latte, earl grey cream puff, and early grey chocolate chip cookie. I'm not even a coffee drinker but I really enjoyed it. As someone whose go-to order is a chai latte, this satisfied my itch for a coffee. The puff had a nice crisp but was filled to the brim with decedent cream. The tea flavor was enough, not overpowering.Enjoying my coffee and puff in there limited seating area on a weekend morning was a wonderful start to my day. Honorable mention -- the other treats looked beautiful and tasty. I will for sure be back to sample more. Stop by or stay a bit, it's a must try!"
140,"I have been wanting to go here for so long and finally can say I have visited Bibble and Sip!We got the lavender latte $4.75, Hong Kong duck $4.75 and two matcha cream puffs. I want to go back to try their earl grey since it sounds really unique and the flavor seems like something that would be really good. I thought that the drinks were average, but the cream puffs were delicious. The matcha was super rich in flavor but still creamy. This was definitely a heavier filling and they do not mess around! The crust was still crunchy when we ate it and did not become soggy at any point which I thought they did a great job at. The shop itself is super cute and thought that their pastries were the perfect amount of sweetness. I would definitely come back to try other items."
141,Bibble and sip has the cutest desserts and everything we ordered was so tasty!! Honestly I didn't wanna even eat the desserts because they were so darn cutee! The matcha cream puff was so light and airy. The raspberry lychee tart was super cute design and had a bit of a sour taste that made you want to eat more and more of it. And the tortoro macaroon had a nice black sesame filling inside and it was enough to fill the macaroon. Overall a cute/fun desert spot in the city!
142,"Experience: We went on a random Friday and it was pretty crowded as expected. Place is pretty popular so be aware of that. Overall, we waited in a line for 5 minutes so not too bad. Seating is very limited.Parking: Honestly, I don't know in the their right mind would drive in NYC. The public transit is amazing here, use it! Worth: I think the pastries are really cute. We honestly went here just to get the Totoro macaroon (as pictured below). Besides that, the place was decent."
143,"So freaking cute wth!!!I found Bibble and Sip by a way of a lucky Yelp search post-Hadestown. I was hooked by the pastry designs and flavors. I ordered...- iced London Float: salted vanilla cream foam, iced earl grey tea, and brown sugar. Sadly, this was almost flavorless. Not getting this again.- raspberry lychee tart: bottom of sweet crust tart, lychee chunks, raspberry bavarian cream, topped with white chocolate and a whipped ganache, and finished with a seasonal macaron on top. The appearance was so freaking adorable with the alpaca-shaped macaron, and the tart itself was fruity and refreshing.-black sesame walnut puff: unfortunately, the black sesame puree on top was bitter. - matcha white chocolate puff: matcha flavor is earthy, but not too overpowering/bitter, thanks to it being tempered by the sweet white chocolate.- earl grey vanilla: earl grey infused cream with vanilla bean. Literally perfect.Overall- 3.5/5. We don't have a place like this back home. I guess that just means I need to head back to NYC to try more of these treats in the future!"
144,"So I've been to New York twice now and I totally forgot to go here the first time. So on my second trip I HAD to go. Everywhere in New York is so walkable so I just walked over and landed in heaven.The place was packed but for good reason! The desserts were soo cute and pretty. What I really wanted was the totoro macaron because Totoro is my absolute favorite ghibli animation. I was about to get the Christmas special with all these other characters but it was pricier, but thinking back I should've gotten it because the Totoro macaron was DELICIOUS. I didn't want to eat him cause he was so cute but omgg I'm glad I did it tasted so good. If you're in New York and want a sweet treat, this is definitely the place to go!"
145,"We love love love this place so much! It's just so cute and their pastries are so light I feel like I could eat everything in one sitting. Ok, probably not a good idea... but this place is legit.We came here because we've heard the cream puffs are amazeballs! And oh! They are! But also their other desserts are delicious! The cloud is amazing and light and delicious!  We also tried their lychee berry which I would definitely get again when we come visit. I don't have much else to write except definitely make this a go to place when you go to NYC! You won't be disappointed!"
146,"Big fan of their cream puffs! Consistently yummy and lots of fun tea flavors like matcha, earl grey, and brown sugar boba. It's worth a stop if you're in the area for Broadway, but I wouldn't necessarily go out of your way to come here. I do when I'm in the neighborhood though!"
147,I absolutely love this bakery.  My friend and I were talking about their Squid Game macarons.   We went there to see what kind of cute baked goodies they had.  This place was crowded on Saturday at 3pm.   The line was long;  it went outside. I brought a black sesame cream puff.  The Totoro macaron was adorable that I had to get that too.  Both items were delicious.
148,What I ordered | Milk Tea Cloud Cake ($11) Taste | the cloud dessert was great. it had a nice milk tea custard flavor inside which was on top of a chocolate crust. thought the white chocolate layer made it taste too sweet. presentation was super cute as well.Service | server was nice! Parking | Street Notes | definitely try to get here when they open. we waited around 30-45 min in line around 3 PM on a Saturday and some of the pastries we wanted to try were sold out.
149,Super cute little bakery. Tried the matcha and Earl Grey cream puffs. The matcha one is okay; wished the matcha flavor was stronger. The Earl Grey one though.....really good! Bold Earl Grey flavor.Trendy interior decor. This place also serves painfully adorable character desserts. Definitely make a stop here especially if you're a cream puff fan!
150,"Pricey but excellent! I stopped by after picking up rush tickets for a musical. Thankfully no line on a Tuesday morning. The cutest cream puffs and desserts you could ask for. $5/puff -but you really do get quality. I ate the sesame cream puff there and brought home macha and earl gray for the family. The puff is so crisp, just wonderful. And the cream was rich, but light. You get what you pay for - best cream puff I have ever had. All the other desserts looked so great, almost a crime to break it up. I will be back to try them out - although it is pricey, to be expected though."
151,Desserts on point! Great place to grab some coffee or tea as well as one of their visually stunning and unique desserts. They play around Asian flavors so you'll find some interesting flavor combos.A dessert that caught my eye was their cloud-shaped boba inspired goodie. Inside was just like a classic milk tea with a white chocolate shell and a cake center. Sooo playful and fun! Great stop just a few blocks outside of the Time Square area!
152,Wow! I'm so bummed that Bibble & Sip is only in New York. I tried a lot of their desserts and have no complaints - all were really good. My favorites / memorable ones are the black sesame walnut puff pastry and the apple shaped one. Everything was the right amount of sweetness for me. I would definitely go back the next time I visit New York again. They are located right across from the Wicked Broadway Musical theatre location (which I also recommend watching!).
153,"The cream puffs are good, but I don't fully understand why people are raving about this place! This place is great for pictures and for your social media, but if you're going more for taste and experience, no offense, but I would say skip :)"
154,"Bibble & Sip has to be the cutest place for desserts. I can't believe out of all the times I've been here, I always forget to write a review. Not that it needs it, there are so many already, and mine won't say anything different.My favorite cream puffs are the earl grey and the black sesame. I like that none of these are overly sweet and there is a good amount of filling. Drinks are good too. The cakes have been hit or miss for me, depending on what preferences are."
155,I've been wanting to try this place for so long! Everything is so cute - I love the alpaca theme. The cream puffs are really good. I've only tried the earl grey so far but it has a solid flavor of early grey. The crunchies on top of the cream puff are ok the sweeter side for me - it almost takes away from the cream part. But I generally appreciate the cream more than the puff; I have friends who really like the puff/cookie part so it probably depends on how much of a sweet tooth you have. The lychee raspberry tart is full of surprises. I was so focused on the llama macaron and the raspberry tart that I forgot about the lychee until I took a bite and got a piece of lychee! The raspberry tart is very light and not overpowering. And the macarons are small and bite size - soft and chewy but crisp outside.The staff I'd very thoughtful too - I bought to go and was worried the whole train ride back that it would move and tip/hit the sides of the box. They tape the paper disk to the box and the tart is pasted onto the disk so that nothing moves!
156,I've reviewed this place before. And I honestly think I need to tack on the last star and round it out as a five star (just avoid the restroom). I keep coming back over and over here because I'm obsessed with their macarons. I know most people go for those cream puffs but their cakes and tarts and the seasonal macarons have got me coming back for many unnecessary trips to this part of town. I really don't like this part of town otherwise so I know my obsession is strong because it keeps pulling me over here.The best seasonal macarons in Asian inspired flavors and a matcha jasmine latte really hits the spot here. I also enjoy the green float which is matcha based with a cheese foam like topping. Come here on a Sunday. Saturday is usually crazy busy all day.
157,"Adorable dessert and drink shop near Times Square :) service was so nice and the menu options were extensive. I tried the black cloud, which is cold brew with a salted vanilla cold foam. I also tried this cute lychee and berry flavored mousse cake, which was so photogenic! Overall I'd definitely recommend this place for a dessert stop if you're in the area."
158,"Huge fan of the cream puffs and drinks here!I was a huge fan of the cream puffs. I'm not 100% positive which flavors as I went over the summer but I believe it was cookies and cream, matcha and earl grey. The cream puffs here are incredibly light and not super overpowering which I enjoy. I honestly like them better than Alimama's in Chinatown.The drinks here are particularly good. I believe I got the roseberry, which was really good and definitely surpassed my expectations.Definitely want to come back in the future to check out the other baked goods!"
159,"Wow the line is long! The indoor space is very limited so best for to go orders. I took some puffs to go and i think it got great compliments with friends. For me i wish there was a plain cream flavor but there wasnt. My favorite was the earl grey and the best way to describe it is that its delicious and not too sweet. Let me tell you, not too sweet is one of the best compliments to give a dessert"
160,"This is one of my favorite bakeries in New York! I love how cute the desserts are and for how they look, they're also tasty! The only thing that I hate is the line !!!!! The most recent time I went I waited in line for about 20 minutes and it's a small place so it does get very claustrophobic in there! You do have the option to order online but you won't get the full selection. Some of my favorite items are: biggie macaron, the earl gray and matcha cream puffs! Keep in mind it's New York so the desserts can be pricey for what you get but if you're up for it, it's worth the splurge!!"
161,"Really cute pastries that not only look good but also taste good. Macarons, cream puffs and mousse cakes were all tasty with excellent flavors (you could actually taste each listed ingredient) and the lattes were great. We came here on a weekday and there was not too much of a wait. We came back on a Saturday and there was a longer line but not terrible. The price for each item is also a good value based - although there are no prices on display for the pastries, so you just need to ask or find out when you check out. They are most popular for their cute food items and the cream puffs, but the black sesame almond crossaint is the item I will be going back for. It was crisp and not too sweet, even on day 2."
162,"Expect a line! We were there for about an hour and the whole time there was a consistent line. Get there early if you want to try some of the famous cream puffs. We were there around 5 and there was not a big selection. We managed to snag an earl grey and salted caramel, if you only have one option get the salted caramel!!! They don't hold back with the amount of cream and what makes this pastry so perfect is it has the perfect amount of sweetness. The iced teas are very natural and also not sweet at all. After you've tasted everything you won't regret having waited in line."
163,"Bibble + Sip is a cute cafe that serves the yummiest cream puffs. I love how light and flavorful each cream puff is. The variety of flavors - earl grey, black sesame walnut, hojicha, matcha, etc. The prices are around $4 for a fist sized cream puff. They are so delightful! I highly recommend for a picnic at a park, a dinner gathering or a day where you need to treat yoself!"
164,Great place for a treat. Was craving somethingnseert and heard about this place songave it a try. I got the hot chocolate which comes with a large marshmallow and the matcha pastry (apologies forget the exact name) everything was so good.
165,"The bibble was pretty good, but the sip was meh.Had the lavender latte and tried my company's iced brown sugar tea. The latte was warm and soothing and the iced drink was good too, but both were lacking in some sweetness. Definitely ask for the drinks to be a little sweeter if that is your taste.The pastries are SO tasty! See attached pictures for the cuteness. The black sesame walnut creampuff was light in taste, and the lychee berry pig pastry was also light in flavor and you could taste hints of lychee and strawberry."
166,Super cute aesthetic and delicious pastries!The Earl Gray Cream Puff was sooo good. Lovely texture of the puff and it was filled to the brim with cream. Just the right level of sweetness.The Cloud cake has a nice milk tea mouse and the brownie pieces were a bit tougher to eat. Overall tasty flavor too. Might have been too sweet after having half. Probably waited 30 min in line for a Saturday afternoon.
167,"The cream puffs are not to be missed!I had the Earl Gray flavor & would have liked to have tried all of them, but only discovered B & S in the last few hours of my trip....Paired my treat with a delicious rose water flavored chai tea.  Service was great too!  A must-go-to place!(& reasonably priced too!)"
168,"Someone once said ""not too sweet"" is the best compliment you can get for desserts. And that is exactly what I want to say about Bibble and Sip's desserts. The cream puffs are FILLED with cream, but because the consistency is so light, you feel like you're eating a cloud! The mousse in milk tea cloud cake is VERY light and subtle and I was not aware of the inside content until I ate the cake. I'm not a huge fan of caramel or chocolate, so I wouldn't get it again but it was enjoyable in the moment. The garlic cream cheese bread was on the slightly heavier side, so I couldn't finish it in one sitting. Everything is very delicious and beautiful, inside and out! Their pastries are an ART!Not pictured, the black sesame and earl grey cream puffs are very delicious too! Personally did not like the black sesame frosting on the cream puff though."
169,"I finally went to one of NYC's most popular bakeries, Bibble & Sip, to try one of their famous cream puffs. I got the Black Sesame Walnut Puff and the Lychee Berry. The puff was nice and fluffy with plenty of cream filling inside. The black sesame and walnut complemented each other well and unlike most cream puffs, this did not taste that heavy at all and was actually more of a light kind of cream. The Lychee Berry was also good- the pic does the best job showing how cute it looks, but basically it is a white tea mousse with lychee compote with a strawberry coating outside the bottom half and a tiny macaron as a little hat for this cute piglet-looking dessert. Like the cream puff, I was surprised that this actually wasn't too sweet at all, and had some nice subtler berry/creamy flavors. Like most popular bakeries, these cute little creations do come with a higher price tag: both of these items together came out to $15 (honestly not too bad, but certainly not cheap).The bakery is pretty small with only a couple tables inside. It can get very busy on the weekends, so you might have to wait in a bit if a line.Overall, Bibble & Sip is indeed deserving of its strong reputation. I wouldn't go as far as some other Yelpers who say that it's super amazing or anything, but it is definitely very tasty (and some of the creations are cute and photogenic too)."
170,"I was expecting this place to be just hype from aesthetic, instaworthy desserts that taste average, but it was surprisingly really delicious! There was a sorta long line when I went at a random time on a weekend, but it moved relatively quickly. They have so many items but I decided to try the Black Sesame Walnut Cream Puff since it was one of the most popular. The texture was perfect and the black sesame tasted very authentic! I can't wait to come back and try more desserts. There are a few tables inside but it gets very crowded, so I got mine to-go."
171,Love their cream puffs and little desserts! I especially love their matcha one and black sesame with chocolate one. My friend said she loved the earl grey one which was less sweet. I also tried the apple and lychee tart and it was also very delicious! I pretty much recommend everything they have - you can't go wrong with any of them!
172,"Ordered takeout - two cream puffs: 1) Earl Grey and 2) Matcha Cream.Both are so simple and so good. For desserts featuring cream-filling, these are my favorite (along with cannolis), based on the light and silky cream, the lightly crunchy shell topping, and how easy it is to eat (in contrast with mille feuilles which sploosh with every other bite)."
173,"What a treat this place is! The desserts are beautiful and the flavors are delicious. My friend recommended it and it did not disappoint!I loved the lychee raspberry tart. ~$8. The flavors were fruity and sweet but not too sweet. The tart was soft. The macarons were okay and felt more decorative in terms of how they baked. Their feet were flat and the filling was average. The hazelnut mousse ~$8 was lovely in presentation and in consistency. The fillings in the cream puffs ~$4-6 were great also. We tried the black sesame and earl grey. I really loved how potent the earl get flavor was and how much cream was inside the cream puff. We got the desserts at the end of their day before closing so I did find the outer shell of the cream puff on the dry side. Overall, definitely worth trying and enjoying the aesthetic cuties!"
174,"Came here because they have cute desserts and was recommended. .Came here for the cream puffs which looks delicious. I got to try the matcha green tea cream puff. The cream puff was ok, wasn't like wow that much. .The matcha ice green tea wasn't strong enough. It was kind of water down. Wifey had the matcha latte and wasn't impressed either. .Its a busy place and the line goes fast. Its cute concept but it was ok for me. I didn't get the wow factor from the cream puff to the ice matcha. Thanks for reading and have a yelptastic day!"
175,"Super, super, super cute!!! I've never been to a place that sold animal macarons like Bibble & Sip. As a hobbyist baker, I know how difficult those are to execute - and even when you have the skill down, how long they take to decorate. Just for aesthetics alone, I'd give them 5 stars, so I won't write about that...Instead, I'll write about what surprised me: their earl grey chocolate chip cookie. I got it on a whim, because I like unusual flavors. I honestly wasn't expecting it to work as well as it did - chocolate can overpower other flavors, and I wasn't sure the tea flavor would come through. Oh boy, was I wrong. If anything, the earl grey tea was the star of the cookie... overpowering the chocolate (a good thing, in my book)! It was an innovative combination that I've never considered before, and something I'd like to try experimenting with on my own.I also had an ube croissant - which was good, but not necessarily worth writing about. To be fair, I tasted the desserts a full 8h or so after I bought them, so I bet the quality of the croissant suffered a lot. Would need to try it immediately after buying to write a more fair assessment.Will be back to Bibble & Sip for some cookies to take home - macarons AND earl grey chocolate chip!"
176,"The desserts live up the hype! Pricey but worth the splurge for beautiful, delicious pastries. The cream puffs are all great - fluffy on the outside and chock full with creamI tried the milk tea cloud pastry and would definitely recommend. Each layer was executed really well - the white chocolate shell, chocolate cake, milk tea mousse. Strong flavors without being too sweet. There's also a surprise liquid milk tea center that I didn't expect. Try this one if you like milk tea and earl grey flavors!"
177,"""Oh yes, that llama dessert place!"" -- when my friend confirmed that we are indeed going to that dessert place that everyone have told me about.We got in at around 3pm on a Saturday, there was a long line of over 15 people ahead of us and every seat in the store had been occupied. I loved the beautifully made bakery here, imaginative but also very tasty."
178,"This place is ADORABLE. All of their pastries are so so cute and so fresh! They are constantly making more so everything is promised to be fresh. I got their Matcha Cream Puff which is Matcha infused Cream w/ White Chocolate and their Earl Grey Cream Puff which is Earl Grey Vanilla Bean infused Cream. Neither of these cream puffs were overly sweet which was amazing because it wasn't overwhelming to eat. Also, the cream on the inside is so light and fluffy almost, didn't feel super heavy which I appreciated. Each Cream Puff was a little over $3 which wasn't too bad especially considering the size of these things!!! They also have GORGEOUS tarts and little cakes. I got their Milk Tea Cloud which was so unique and yummy! It had different textures and flavors that went together perfectly. This place gets super busy but they move very very quickly and there is some seating inside!"
179,"My bf and I randomly stumbled upon Bibble and Sip on Monday. I've heard a lot about this place and was excited to finally try it! We got the cookies and creme cream puff. There is a TON of cream, but thankfully not overly sweet. I think I'd be satisfied sharing one puff with at least another person. I don't think I could eat a full one myself.We also tried the lychee berry - it was a cute little piggy. I wasn't a fan. I didn't like the texture of the mousse and the strawberry shell on the outside was stuck onto the base so it was hard to even cut it in half without the whole thing falling over. I only got a faint hint of lychee and they put the thinnest slice of matcha cake on the bottom, I barely tasted it. Some how our 3 things ended up being $19. Seemed pretty pricey to us."
180,"Their noodle soup is not pho even though online it says it is. It was my fault as my eye already pinned them as only being good in Malaysian dishes which is what I will order next time I come. The noodle soup wasn't bad, but it was herbal which I do like but is not pho."
181,Food was not fresh even tofu . And people working at the restaurant were not nice. The lady put the fork and knife like a throw on me
182,"Girlfriend and I came here late one night as we walked around down town Manhattan. The food was alright, service was extremely quick but the portion sizes were a bit on the smaller side especially with the price tags associated for the entrees. We tried 4 dishes and all of them were great. Definitely aim to order a bit more for meals. Also, they serve everything off of single-use plates and cups which is a huge environmental tax. Would be weary of that since portion sizes."
183,"Ambiance- Very cute and low key! Would be great for a casual date or dinner with friends; tables are decently spaced out so we felt good about dining indoors during COVID. Service- SO friendly  Owner came by and chatted for a bit, and all the staff members were friendly and prompt. Food came out quickly and as ordered. Food- Don't miss the roti canai!! We also got Uncle Plumps dumplings, which were delicious-- but if you can only stomach one appetizer I'd say go with the roti :). For our meal we got the shrimp laksa (really hit the spot on a cold snowy day!!) and beef nasi lemak. Would absolutely come again and try a few more dishes; definitely recommend a visit."
184,"Perhaps they switched chefs?~ staff  weren't particularly friendly upon greeting and during the meal~pad Thai was quite oily. All 4 of us ordered the dish with different variations of protein ~served using paper plates.  Two ordered beer: one requested glass.  No glass - just paper cup provided.  As an aside the use of paper wasn't ""bad"" and if the meal had been better ... +enjoyed the roti +shrimps in the pad Thai were good size and tastySummary - wouldn't return and restaurant didn't live up to the ""more recent"" yelp reviews. We don't eat out a ton so rely on Yelp reviews to be our guide.  Unfortunately, for us, this restaurant was a dud.   And if you think their pad Thai one of best in NY your taste buds must have been affected by Covid!!  But again perhaps change in chef - and could explain the staff's general lack of friendliness~Cost - $30 pp including tax + tip~Single bathroom was clean."
185,I Tried their pho yesterday and loved it ! Soup was very flavorful and they give you a good portion of beef and noodles.
186,"Excellent customer service, very friendly and patient servers. Food is ~ok. Prices are quite good. There is too large a variety of cuisine (Vietnamese, Thai, Malaysian...) to be particularly good at any one thing.I had the pho ga and edamame. Both were ~ok. Could be good a good place for hanging out in groups. Could be a decent date spot if quality of food is not a high priority."
187,Looking for a great authentic spot in the EV? This is it! Good service and great food. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Don't leave without the coconut rice though.
188,"Finally got to try this place and I'll definitely be coming back! MUST TRY: Roti CanaiOur group loved the roti so much we got 4 orders. Their recipe and buttery and addicting. All the food was very flavorful so be sure to order some rice to balance out all that flavor.The owner was very nice and came by our table to ask how we enjoyed the food. He's very hard working and mentioned that he'll even be open on Chinese New Year. I almost always get an iced coffee wherever I go so I had to try theirs. It had a strong coffee taste but was a bit too watery for my liking.Overall, very home style feel to this restaurant and definitely enjoyed my meal."
189,as a northern Chinese， i eat a lot of food made of wheat（mianshi面食）. i have to say their （mianshi）like planta is the best in the whole world！this really reminds me of the mianshi in my hometown. And it is even better
190,Worse! Paper plates paper cups pathetic slop called food. These reviews must be from drunken stupor.
191,"Everything was better than expected, and I eat Thai food regularly. I had the Thai Dumplings and Pad Thai."
192,"Was craving beef rendang so hard today, but I've had better. This one honestly tasted like it was burnt, and the beef was tough. The beef pad kee mao was ok -beef was very juicy and tender, but the seasoning was more Chinese than Thai imo."
193,"DELIVERY REVIEWI'm not sure if this was an off day or what but I can't see how this place has any good reviews. Our food arrived cold, dry, and flavorless with missing ingredients. Corner and cost cutting measures seem to be to blame, which I hate to call out given the pandemic challenges I'm sure this place is battling. Crab Rangoon: not enough cream cheese, no crab whatsoever. Just bits of red onion inside. Thai Fried Rice: dry and flavorless. Has do be doused with sriracha. The tofu was remarkably bland.Pad See Ew w/chicken: also dry. It was clear no one tossed the noodles when they were adding the sauces as large swaths of the noodles were sheet white.Tom Yum Soup: no mushrooms or really any toppings. Just liquid.Coconut Curry Soup: the only thing we liked and the only reason I'm not giving this place one star."
194,Fantastic South Asian comfort food in the East Village. The price and atmosphere is amazing to chill! Food is also great
195,"My absolute favorite thai place in NYC, amazing customer service and amazing food. amazing!!"
196,"The food was awful. Salty, smelled burnt, served in flimsy plastic plates, and the pad Thai had ketchup sauce in it. I'm giving that one star to the Jasmine tea that was tasty. Everything else was absolutely inedible. Don't know how they got this rating ..."
197,"LoveMama is a really unassuming restaurant with amazing tasting food. Since it's right in the east village you can expect young people like students and yuppies in groups dining in. The menu has a lot of great Asian food mainly Vietnamese, Thai and Malaysian. They serve all the food in paper paper plates. I highly suggest ordering any dumplings and nasi goreng was phenomenal."
198,"Flat out incredible. Simple menu, every dish packs a delicious punch, and the owner is a sweetheart."
199,"Usually restaurants that offer up multiple countries' cuisine don't do all of them great.  LoveMama is the exception.  This is a fantastic restaurant with Thai, Malaysian and Vietnamese food.  We had a reservation, were seated promptly and our server came right away to say help.  The food here is wonderful and the atmosphere is really nice.  All in all a great place for dinner."
200,"Came here for lunch on a weekday and ordered the roti canai planta ($7), pad thai with chicken lunch combo ($11), and pad see ew with chicken lunch combo ($11). Didn't look like they had outdoor dining when we were there, but there was plenty of indoor dining, with plexiglass separators between each table.Everything was really flavorful and tasty! We probably ordered the most basic items on the menu, but they were done so well, and differently (more authentically?) than other places. The pad thai had a very complex sauce with lots of fresh spices; none of that one-note, sickly sweet peanut nonsense that you sometimes come across. The pad see ew was nice and savory and the noodle texture was superb; the large, flat noodles were not soggy and mushy at all, but perfectly done.My minor complaints were that the roti canai was quite small (though very yummy) and it didn't come with enough dal, and the noodles in the pad thai were slightly underdone (preferable to the converse, though). Hopefully they can also switch back to real tableware, soon, or use more eco-friendly disposable ones. The server was very friendly and stopped to talk with us a bit, and it was sad to hear that currently they're only doing 30% of the business they used to do. No clue if this long, nitpicky Yelp review will help in any way, but I hope LoveMama and its delicious mastery of at least two cuisines (maybe I'll try the Vietnamese menu next time!) survive the pandemic. Overall I would definitely come back to try other tempting things on the sprawling menu, or even just to make my same, basic order again."
201,Delicious food at a great price! The people who work here are super friendly and make you feel very welcome. It's definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.
202,"Everything here is delicious! I ordered the pad Thai and the pad Kee mao, both were fire. And the waiter put me on to the dessert, rice pudding with mango and coconut cream. My girl doesn't like coconut but ate it all. Definitely give this place a try and enjoy your food!"
203,"This is first time coming in into this restaurant, and the food was pretty amazing. The owner was really friendly, and it nice to talk too. Gotta love this restaurant. Someday I would love to my friends introduce this place."
204,The staff was super nice and the food was delicious and came fast. I especially loved that they made sure our water was refilled if it ever ran low.
205,"This place is great! Food is served on paper plates and it's authentic, delicious and affordable. I had--roti canai: this was so delicious and I really loved the dipping sauce. The roti itself was super flakey and delicious -rendang lasi lemak (chicken)- I was hoping the chicken would be more tender but the flavor was great! -mee goreng- great Smokey flavor with a slight hint of sweetness Highly recommend!"
206,Very authentic taste! Came in for some home style food and was not disappointed. Definitely coming back and highly recommend it!
207,"Pad thai is to literallly die for. like I will gladly lay down my life in honor of this establishment's pad thai. oh and don't get me started on the thai iced tea. so gd satisfying, cured me of all material wants and desires. would give 7 stars if I could. people were the best and a very sweet man told me that my boyfriend and I would have tall babies. I would let him officiate my wedding."
208,"Well whoever is writing this restaurant makes incredible Thaifood must not have had many great Thai food restaurants to compare to.We ordered pad Thai and red Curry. Pad Thai, no veggies, four small pieces of chicken and not spiced but overly sweet.Red Curry, very few veggies, like three small pieces of broccoli and not spiced very well.For all these incredible reviews, left us underwhelmed."
209,"Awesome mee goreng, nasi lemak, and pad thai!!! Uncle plumps dumplings are awesome and I've bad the best fried calamari of all time here. Super cozy vibes and all the food is super flavorful but doesn't make me feel really thirsty or bad afterwards. I love this place!!"
210,"They weren't lying when they said they got the best bagel. This was my first time ever trying a Lox Bagel and I honestly fell in love. These bagels were freakin huge!!! I got the smoked salmon with regular cream cheese on an everything bagel and ooo they sure packed that thing. The cream cheese was sooo creamy and the salmon was fresh. I never thought the combo of those two would work but it definitely does!! My friend got their Breakfast Power Sandwich which has egg whites, turkey, tomatoes and spinach. A more heathy route to go but still a really good breakfast sandwich! I'm usually not a fan of tomatoes but in the sandwich? It was still a yes from me! Overall LOVE this place, still thinking about that bagel today. The bagel portion is huge, my friend and I both only ate half but we saved the other half for e went at a perfect time and beat the lines just by a minute but it definitely grew quickly so prepare for a wait!"
211,"Best Bagels & Coffee has one of the best bagels in the city. It's conveniently located near Macy's and is popular amongst both locals and tourists.The bagels are $1.70 each and they have a variety of flavors from Plain and Cinnamon Raisin to Everything.They also have a wide range of spreads / cream cheese and sandwich options as well.The bagels are HUGE (bigger than any other bagel I've seen or had), soft and chewy.I normally just order a couple of bagels and slice and freeze any left over so I can reheat them to eat whenever I want."
212,"I've stopped by the shop twice on different occasions visiting NYC now. The first time I had the Bacon, Egg, and Cheese bagel, and I thought it was good but nothing too crazy to rave about.This time around, I've browsed through the reviews and ordered the most common item every one'd suggested - Smoked salmon on an Everything bagel. I added regular cream cheese and avocado for mine. I'd say it was a HUGEEE bagel when I picked it up! Definitely had to share with my SO, and even he wasn't able to finish his half (but then he wasn't much of a bagel fan either). Definitely a load of smoke salmon slices, and the cream cheese spread was abundant. The bagel was toasted, with the seasoning popping! I really enjoy the bagel this time. However, I'd leave this as 4 stars due to having a hard time justifying this bagel for the total price of $16. Not sure if I'd get a bagel at this sticker price again, but maybe during my next trip to NYC? Tips - Order for online pickup to avoid the long line, if you can! We were able to pick up after placing our order online and walked from out hotel (~10' walk), versus the line was almost out the door when we came..."
213,"This was my favorite bagel spot for this NYC trip! We had a late morning start to the day, so there wasn't a line when we arrived. The staff were friendly and we got our bagels quickly after ordering.The smoked salmon bagel is simple, but so tasty. All the extra toppings definitely adds to the bagel. They also have other savory bagels if smoked salmon isn't your thing.It's a bit expensive, so I'd recommend splitting it and sharing the bagel with someone. The bagel is huge, so one half is enough to fill you up.The order:-Everything Bagel with smoked salmon, cream cheese, tomato, onions, avocado, and capers ($17.86)"
214,"Best.Bagel.The coffee was alright, but the bagel was best-er than I ever expected. It's rare when a business is so appropriately named, but Best Bagel really is best-ish.Unfortunately, the best bagels in life aren't free ... and there is a line ... always a line. Oh, and the bagels are heavy, chewy beasts with more carbs and calories than I need in a day, but that's what makes them the best-est ever.My best suggestions:  1. Toasted Cinnamon Raisin Bagel w/ Cinnamon, Walnut, & Raisin Cream Cheese 2. Smoked Salmon Sandwich Toasted Garlic Bagel w/ Cream Cheese, Tomato, & Onions 3. Whatev bagel brings out your best Because this is Best Bagel ...  and the bagels are truly are best-ier than others in New York."
215,"We only went here because it was nearby and had rave reviews. Not even kidding.This is probably the most impromptu visit to an eatery I've made in FOREVER. I don't tend to do spontaneous as I plan out everything to a T, but how can you be in New York City and not have an infamous bagel?Honestly, if you can, you should probably order online. We should've done that to avoid the half-hour line, but eh, even then... there's no rhyme or reason as to how they call out numbers, because yes, they call out numbers and that's how you get your food. And my dears, it isn't sequential. 42 can come before 15.That said, there are several other bagel shops around but none like this one. It was full of people. The secret is out that this is the place to be, and well, after having a blueberry bagel from there that might possibly be the best one I've ever had, I can see why. As for the coffee? It's hit or miss. Mine was fine, but my girlfriend's tasted like tar. I may be exaggerating here, but it was unfinishable (if that's even a word).So in short, order online, get some bagels, pack your patience for this outing, and skip the coffee. Oh, and thank me later."
216,"Continuing on our bagel breakfast runs, we stopped by Best Bagel & Coffee before getting on with the day's activities on a Thursday.We split the smoked salmon sandwich on a toasted sesame bagel ($12.50). The sandwich came with cream cheese, tomatos, and onions. It's hefty too, so splitting it ensures no food coma later on.There's seating inside, but you gotta keep your eyes peeled for an open spot. Most people take theirs to go in the morning."
217,When I tell you this is one of the best bagels I've ever had I'm not lying. I went around 11am on a Sunday and the place was packed! But the line goes so fast and the food (and coffee) are excellent! I like how you can really customize every bagel/sandwich. There's a few tables inside and outside to sit at too
218,Oh my that was so good. Now I can see why NYC makes the best bagels literally. Made my way here early in the morning. It was fairly busy as my group walked in. It had a nice flow from ordering to pick up. I saw the lox salmon bagel and knew that was the one I was gonna order.The bagel itself was perfectly chewy. Nothing like it. Must be the NYC water right? Just the texture is so good. The salmon and cream cheese was a healthy portion. I was pretty full after scarfing down this whole thing. A must visit when in NYC!Recommendation: Lox salmon bagel
219,"Best Bagel is rightfully named !!! The best lox bagel I ever had. Bagel- thick, fluffy, soft interior  and with a slightly crispy crust on top. Lox- plentiful, smooth and melt in your moth without any fishiness.Coffee, I would skip, definitely not the greatest. But the bagel sure made up for it!!"
220,"So the name says it all! It's been years since we had a NY bagel Sammy and it didn't disappoint. Fried egg and sausage on an everything bagel. Commence your mouth to watering!Best Bagel moved the line super fast and although small, there are places to sit and stand while you eat.We bought an extra dozen to bring home to FL to share with family. Doughier than FL bagels, but they are the originals and packed with flavor."
221,Chewy delicious bagel with a lot of cream cheese! Very fast service and great flavor.
222,"The last time I was here, I actually ordered in advance for pickup. My order was ready upon arrival and I was surprised to see that there wasn't a long wait for people who were ordering in person. I opted for a lox sandwich with everything bagel and scallion cream cheese. Def can't go wrong with that and I'm drooling just thinking about when I'll be back in NY to get a good NY bagel again."
223,"Great bagels! We had an everything bagel with two different cream cheeses. They lightly toasted the bagel and were very generous with the cream cheese.Coffee was okay, better off getting it at a coffee shop."
224,"It's called Best Bagel and Coffee for a reason. Their smoked salmon sandwich (add hot sauce) is everything I need in the morning. The bagel sandwiches are enormous, way too big for me to finish by myself so it's nice to be able to share. We went here twice in our time in NY - the first time, my boyfriend and I got a smoked salmon sandwich AND a sausage egg bagel sandwich. Omg it was so much food that early in the morning. We also got some coffee to go, but I don't recall it being anything special. There's going to be two lines, one that'll be the first group of people you see - these people already ordered and paid!! If you're not sure, don't hesitate to ask - don't waste your time!! There's so much to do in NYC, just ask!The order line is further back. They're super quick with taking your order, so be prepared. My friend suggested I ask to add hot sauce to the bagel, which I did on the second time. I was too frazzled by being in the wrong line the first time. You tell one register what your order is and then funnel down the line to actually pay at another register. Seating is very limited so expect to eat standing somewhere, or bring it with you somewhere. People finish at the tables pretty quickly so you might be able to grab a table while waiting. This is a must visit while in NYC."
225,"Ordered:Whole wheat everything bagel, scooped out, toasted, with lox spread (~$6)Egg & cheese on sesame bagel, scooped out, toasted, with avocado (~$7)10 oz Fresh Orange Juice (~$4)Large Iced Caramel Latte with Milk (~$5)Aya's take:No better place for bagels than NYC! This spot gets busy but lines move quick. We asked them to scoop out the insides but they didn't do a great job at that. We also wanted a lox bagel not the spread, but it was still good. The orange juice and iced caramel latte really made the breakfast complete. Get the orange juice!!"
226,"Off the beaten, path but well worth the visit. Line is out the door, but moves quickly.They live up to their name ""Best Bagels""Fresh and tasty Great latte too."
227,"This place definitely seems to live up to its name.  The bagels here are great!  I got a lox bagel sandwich which was solid, it was huge and had so much salmon!  The bagel itself was soft and so good.  This place was very busy, but the line does move quickly, the service is very efficient!"
228,"Got a turkey and egg bagel this morning - fast moving place for pickup orders and bagels with cream cheese, but a much longer wait for breakfast sandwiches. Overall good bagel but not necessarily best bagel - I'll probably try it again though!"
229,"When in New York, bagel sandwiches are the move. I had a traditional sausage, egg, and cheese on an Asiago bagel and it was SO good for a seemingly basic bagel sandwich. My boyfriend had the smoked salmon bagel sandwich and it was AMAZING.  It was relatively crowded for a Monday morning, but the line went quickly. However, seating and counter space are limited so it is a good on-the-go stop."
230,"Headed to Best Bagels & Coffee at 6am before our flight out of the city. Such a great way to end our trip to New York. This bagel was delicious and I added all the fixings: lox, capers and scallion cream cheese. As always, it was super filling and definitely best eaten in two sittings. The lox was fresh and the capers a tasty, salty addition. The everything bagel and scallion cream cheese were also the perfect complement to the tasty lox.A very simple, straightforward establishment with friendly and quick service. Big fan and recommend for anyone staying in the area or passing through!"
231,"Great bagels in a crazy busy place. Bagels are delicious and made as ordered. Latte was excellent.   If you have time and want a delicious NY bagel, this is your place.  They manage the long line well. Definitely recommend this place despite the line! Best bagel we found in Manhattan."
232,"I feel like their bagels have gone down in quality :( I first visited in January of 2020 and had a life-changing experience; their Atlantic salmon bagel sandwich was the best bagel I had ever had and every subsequent bagel couldn't compare. I raved about Best Bagel and Coffee to all my friends. I visited again mid November 2021 and I was pretty disappointed with my experience. It pains me to write this review because Best Bagel was the highlight of my last trip to NYC but is now the lowlight of my most recent trip.Overall, yes, their bagels are still good! Still tasty, super filling and thick, but with the decrease in quality, not worth the prices or wait time. I got the Atlantic salmon bagel again but the bagel seemed underdone? It was super doughy on the inside and had that slightly yeasty taste that comes with underbaked bread. My friends also got the Atlantic salmon sandwich and they agreed with the doughiness. For $13-15 a sandwich, I would expect more :( In addition, one of my friends paid $2.50 extra for avocado on her bagel (spending a total of $17+ on her bagel!!!) but the staff forgot her avocado. She also asked for no onions, but she still had onions in her sandwich. I still love how huge their sandwiches are, how thick they slather on the cream cheese, and how many different cream cheeses they offer, but that doesn't justify the packed, super long lines in the morning + undercooked bagels + poor customer service. Maybe this was an off-day for them, but I'm going to start looking for a new go-to bagel place in the city.Highly recommend ordering online ahead!! Very limited seating."
233,"On a scale of romance novels to documentaries, Best Bagel & Coffee is a fast-paced thriller novel. Packed full of suspense, you've got to know your order and move quickly. There's no time for morning grogginess, and if you take an extra minute to choose something, the cashier has already completed your order. Thankfully, she was patient with me when I asked to open another check. The shop was bustling, and to an out-of-towner, so overstimulating. But everyone was great, and I got my amazing bagel (so it all ended well)!"
234,"Honestly I think this place lives up to best bagels! Trick for weekend bagels is to order online ahead of time. I got smoked salmon on an everything bagel with plain cream cheese, cucumbers, and capers. Super yum. Maybe a little spendy for a bagel sandwich but it's a fun weekend treat!"
235,"They said BEST bagel?? Well they were spot on. I was on an early flight into NY so my friends and I got lucky and beat the long line. No seriously, get here before 9am because the line gets long really fast. They have an overwhelming large amount of options to choose from - savory bagel sandwich with chicken, breakfast bagel with eggs/bacon, bagel with salmon and cream cheese, you name it. It really is a make-it-your-own type of place and you cant go wrong with whatever you pick. My friends and I each got something different and it was the best first meal in NY i could've asked for. My personal favorite was definitely the salmon lox - the cream cheese with salmon was absolutely perfect. Def a ny staple"
236,"Big fluffy bagels the size of your face! Seriously, if you take these home good luck getting it to fit in a traditional toaster. Busy, but line moves quickly thanks to two ordering stations, an army staff, and a dedicated cash register. Looks like you can mobile order in advance too. Seating: only about 4 tables and 2 standing tables, be prepared to hover to try to snag a table, or take somewhere elseFood: boiled and baked ginormous bagels with a slew of cream cheese options. Very nom. We also ordered a pastrami sandwich to go and that was good too."
237,"This place was packed this morning so I had pretty high expectations. I ordered the smoked salmon sandwich with cream cheese, red onions and tomatoes and a coffee with cream and sugar. Wait wasn't too bad between ordering and receiving but wtf where were my tomatoes and onions?? The order taker was pounding so hard at the screen when taking my order I was sure he would have it right- but nope- tons of freaking lettuce in my sandwich and no tomatoes or onions to be seen. Wtf. It was a zoo in there so we took shelter at a neighboring hotel's awning and I didn't want to claw my way back through the crowd. Ugh what a disappointment."
238,"After spending a couple weeks in the UK, there was nothing I wanted more on my first morning back in the U.S.A. than a New York bagel for breakfast! We looked for a place close to our hotel and this place came up first on Yelp so we decided to check it out. We were lucky, it was a Thursday morning and there was no line! But that meant there wasn't a lot of time to look over the menu, so I went with my go-to everything bagel with cream cheese and tomato. My daughter ordered the same. There are not too many tables available for seating due to Covid and all were taken so we waited at an open standing table for our order. The bagels here are baked on the premises so that already scored big points in my book! Once they were ready, I was impressed with the generous serving of cream cheese in each one (almost too much)! The bagels were very fresh and delicious! We would definitely go back!"
239,"Best Bagel & Coffee is legitimately the BEST bagels in NYC! Period.Real talk though, just be prepared to wait in a line out the door, especially on weekends. Luckily they keep the line flowing relatively fast, and it's worth it.I recommend their everything bagel, lox (smoked salmon), and scallion cream cheese. Toasting it is a must, then tomatoes/red onions are optional. I also really liked their cinnamon raisin bagel w/ strawberry cream cheese.If y'all feel like expanding, please bring a location to Houston, TX! Thanks, can't wait to come back again!"
240,"Don't be scared of the long lines here--it moves fast! We went on a Saturday around 11:30 a.m. and the line was down the block pretty far. Luckily the line moved fast and we probably only waited for 15 minutes. The bagel is delicious! Very good quality. I got bacon, egg, and cheese on an everything bagel. You get to pick what type of cheese you want, and the bacon was super crispy and tasty. My only complaint is that I wish the bagel had more everything seasoning on it."
241,"Smoked salmon and cream cheese on an everything bagel was so delicious. The portions were very generous, we were both stuffed by the time we were done. The bagels were so chewy and had a crunchy texture!Also ordered a couple more bagels to go, but they gave us plain bagels instead of the everything bagels we asked for. Definitely check the bag before leaving!"
242,"Oh damn these bagels really do live up to the hype! It's straight up chaotic to get one as the line between ordering and pick up is blurred, out the door, but is totally worth it. Know what you want before you get in that line- it moves quickly and you don't want to be the one holding it up in front of a mob of hungry New Yorkers. My friend and I decided to split a toasted Everything with vegan veggie cream cheese, tomato, and avocado. Even writing this I'm regretting not getting my own because it was sooooo delicious! Not every bagel shop in Manhattan has vegan cream cheese, let alone more than one option, so I was thrilled. The veggie cream cheese was fantastic and I'd get in that line again in a hot minute."
243,"Great spot to go for an authentic NYC bagel! There was a long line but it moved very quickly and we only needed to wait a few minutes for our order. I got a plain bagel with jalapeño cream cheese. The bagel was absolutely LOADED with cream cheese and I ended up scraping half of it off. Once I did this, though, I was able to actually taste and appreciate the bagel itself. Underneath all that cream cheese lies an excellent bagel! Would return, but ask for either less cream cheese or just a plain bagel!"
244,"Truly the best. Service: Even with a consecutive flow of customers, the staff remained polite and quick to serve. They asked if I wanted my bagel toasted --it's the little things that make the experience great.Food: Smoked Salmon Sandwich with Everything Bagel & Scallion Cream Cheese -- This. Shit. Good. If you enjoy salmon, this is the sandwich for you. The scallion cream cheese mellows out the umami and fish breath from the lox, while the everything bagel provided the seasoning I didn't know I needed.Highly recommended.I'd say equally as as good as the competitor up the street (iykyk).Pros for this spot: more lox in your sandwich"
245,"Hands down THE best bagel place in the entire city and definitely always a must if you're in town. There's just something about the blistering crust with the right amount of chewiness that I have yet to find in any other bagel place. And you need to get the lox, because otherwise did you truly have a NYC bagel experience??Also this is my second or third time here but the first time we went it was during the middle of a polar vortex and it was still 1000% worth"
246,The largest fattest bagel in the city you'll ever have. I make it a point to come here and get my bagel fixings every time I'm visiting to fuel up for a day of walking and I'm usually solid until dinner time. The bagels are thick and perfectly chewy. The fillings and cream cheeses are plentiful and creamy. Coffee is solid and strong. I would go as far as to say it's the best bagel in the city. If you're obsessed with bagels this is the place. Expect to wait tho lines are always long but fast
247,"Definitely a misnomer by calling it Best Bagel & Coffee but it's a totally acceptable bagel that my parents loved when I brought home a dozen from New York this past weekend. I used to live near this place and was never obsessed with it (long lines and imo bagels that were just okay) but when I brought home Murray's last time and got average reviews I figured I would try something else.In all fairness, better than I remembered, but still chewier than I preferred. Cinnamon raisin has a strong flavor which I like. I also ordered an everything with sundried tomato cream cheese and there wasn't nearly enough cream cheese which I never find is the case in New York. With that said, I got a dozen for like $21 and they're massive, were delivered well, and were sliced as requested, so it's tough to complain. If I remember correctly, beware long lines in the morning. They always moved quickly though (again this was like 4 years ago so maybe something has changed).Would return if I were in the area."
248,Truly the best bagel as the name states! I was craving a lox bagel and decide to try this place out. I came on a Sunday morning and the line was long. However it was worth the wait since the bagels were amazing! It was the best lox bagel I've had so far. I love smoked salmon and I like how they put more smoked salmon into my bagel in comparison to other places. The bagels also came in huge portions that I was only able to finish half in one setting. Can't wait to come back and try the other bagels that they have next time!
249,"these bagels are LOADED - they put a ton of cheese, egg, cream cheese, and any other topping you request. It would be great if the bagel was a little crispier on the outside but overall a solid spot."
250,Best Thai food I have had in the city. The decor is also so beautiful! Go for lunch they have lunch specials! And the cocktails so on point. Love it! Can't wait to go back.
251,"This is the best Thai food I've had in NYC. This restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful. Definitely a great place to take people from out of town because it's really unique. Service was great as well. You can taste the freshness in the food and everything is super flavorful. I ordered the below (family style) for three people and it was more than enough food:-Papaya Salad: Recommend! Tastes just like a papaya salad should. -Chicken Pandan Leaves: recommend! The chicken is sooo tender. -Curry Puffs: they taste similar to a samosa. They were good, but the least favorite thing we ordered. -Pad Se Ew: Recommend! Tastes just like pad se ew should. -Red Curry: recommend! Really good, not too spicy and perfect consistency. Sometimes I feel like curry can be too watery. -Cashew Nut Chicken (I think): can't remember the chicken entree we got but I think it was that. It was delicious. Much more flavorful than I was anticipating."
252,"My friend and I walked pass and the restaurant looked so nice, so we decided to drop by to get some drinks. We had Boat helped us out at the bar. He recommended cocktails and some appetizers. Drinks were great , food were delicious. Boat was very helpful and he was super funny :) we definitely be back !"
253,"Thai Villa has a tempting menu that makes you want to branch out from your go-to Thai order, in addition to lovely presentation of its incredible food. We arrived at 7pm on a weeknight and were told a table for two indoors would have been a 45-minute wait, so we chose to sit in the covered/heated outdoor area (probably doesn't offer much additional covid safety since it's enclosed, but it's very pretty) and were seated immediately. I ordered a Petchaboon cocktail (similar to a whiskey sour) to start. My friend and I split Pad Thai and Talay Thai, which is a mixed seafood dish. The noodles were perfect and I loved all of the seafood in the Talay Thai, especially the squid - everything was steamed and cooked in a delicious tangy broth, which was so good I could have eaten it without any add-ins. The other fish options on the menu looked particularly good, so that's what I'd be excited to try on the next visit."
254,Amazing Thai food!!Went here for my friend's birthday (it's his FAVORITE restaurant) and everything was excellent. My favorite was the green curry with duck. I was craving it for weeks after. Please try it!! The decor/ambiance reminds me of actual Thailand too - beautifully ornate.Will definitely come back next time I am in New York!
255,"I've heard only great things about the Thai food here and it did not disappoint! First of all, amazing gluten free options! There's a clearly marked menu, so anyone with a gluten allergy, I would say this place is a safe bet. I tried the papaya salad, the steamed dumplings, the Royal Pad Thai, and the Talay Thai.  All the food was great! The Royal pad Thai was amazing I loved the egg around the dish, and the fact that it was familiar but also new. My favorite was the Talay Thai, the sauce was creamy and a little spicy, like a red curry, but the seafood, oh my god, perfect. The mussels were perfectly cooked, the shrimp were perfectly cooked, and the squid were perfectly cooked. I cannot stop thinking about this dish, give it a try!"
256,"Still the best, just a bit more crowded. Definitely try to make a reservation in advance! Their outdoor seating is really warm and enclosed. It definitely protects against NYC winter! We tried the color changing tea and it was so cool! Definitely recommend for the awe but flavor wise they have so many better options. I will keep saying this until it proves wrong but I'm wholly convinced this restaurant has the best curry dishes- red curry, green curry, everything is phenomenal."
257,"One of my favorite Thai places in the city and the restaurant I take everyone who's visiting. Love their basil fried rice, drunken noodles, and Panang curry."
258,"Now for my followers, well, it's Italian in my world first, incl pizza reviews, Steak , yes love it, and I love Thai. Now what a find this place is, hard to get reservations, but worth doing in advance. My son's huge Thai fan puts this 1#in NYC and that's saying something. So we started with a  bottle of prosecco and  vegetable dumplings 5.0 &  vegetable spring rolls. 3.9. My son loves it hot and  spicy. He orderedKRAPAW GAI SUB Minced chicken ( hot) 5.0For me.. Garlic chicken  5.0 Also on the table was Corn soup 4.9Moo-OBB NAM PUAUG ( Pork & Sickly rice  with bok choy) easy 5.0 delicious.Not much more to say, nice restaurant, very neat clean, and great ambience.  Ask for a booth if you can get it. So final word on this one is ..GO THERE."
259,"4.5 stars! Our waiter was so so nice and accommodating. The good: Tom yum soup was delicious and full of flavor! I would go back just to get the soup again. The kee mao was delicious and very hot. The pad Thai was generous in portion and very delicious! The bad: price is not cheap. The restaurant is very crowded, so 6ft is just not possible at all making me anxious. The biggest reason was the man who was greeting us at the door was so .. rude and abrasive. There are nicer ways to tell us to go stand at a certain area and wait. Bad first impression. Overall delicious food!"
260,When you walk in you really feel like yoy aren't in nyc. the attention to detail in the design of the restaurant is beautiful. The menu was a bit overwhelming because everything looked so delicious. I started off with a thai tea while my friends got cocktails. Let me tell you this Thai tea was so yummy I might stop by just for the tea to go. The pad Thai was absolutely delicious - I added some red pepper flakes and it really did the trick. The sea bass came with a beautiful presentation. The coconut curry sauce was so tasty but not too heavy which I really enjoyed. The staff was really also very nice and funny. Ps. This restaurant has a 1.5 hour table limit. They rushed us to order and at 2 hours let us know that the next party is waiting for the table.
261,"Did somebody say lunch special for a low price ??? SIGN ME UP!! I will never miss a good deal on food! Unfortunately, my friend and I stopped by when it was pretty crowded so we had outdoor seating which wasn't that bad. It was like a cute green house and it wasn't cold either.We ordered:Kea Mao w/ mock duck ($13)Green curry w/ chicken ($13)Thai villa offers lunch specials during M-F, 11:30-3:45PM for low price of $12-15 for lots of different options of noodles, rice and sautéed dishes. AND it comes with a mini appetizer and a choice of soup/salad.Sadly, their chive pancake was sold out that day ): ITS THE BEST!!! Please try it if it's available! My friend and I ended up getting the the crispy veggie spring rolls. She got the mushroom soup and I got the salad. The salad was refreshing and it came with peanut sauce. The soup was uh questionable. Please pass.Girl, GIRL. The kea mao was soooo spicy omg. The noodles were chewy and delicious. And the mock duck is amazing but my mouth be burning. Get this if you can handle thai spice! It's so good it hurts LOLThe green curry came with rice but the rice was kind of hard and cold. I guess that's what happens when they got to bring it outdoors. The green curry was also spicy but super rich in flavor. The coconut milk was so fragrant.Solid lunch! Will definitely be back again to get that indoor seating view (and the chive pancakes!)"
262,"This place kind of reminds me of Vegas with how it's decorated. Which sounds silly but it's just so intricate and many restaurants there are like that. I really enjoyed coming here, my friend made a reservation but it would've had us outside and luckily they had space at the bar so we got to sit there instead. The service was really fast, ambiance was on point, and music was the perfect volume where you can't really hear the conversations of your neighbors but it doesn't make it hard to chat between yourselves. The food itself was priced well for the amount of food you get considering the proximity to Union Square. Would highly recommend."
263,"Loved this place! Their fried chive pancakes were so crispy on the outside and super soft and chewy on the inside. The pad thai, pad se eew, and penang curry had great flavor. Their lunch special is an amazing deal. The staff were so nice. The tom yum fried rice wasn't what I expected (it didnt taste like tom yum soup) and wasn't that great. I would definitely come back for their prices! [food insta: @strwbrrryboba :)]"
264,Doordashed some chicken pad thai for my sister and she loved it! They got the order correct and it arrived nice and hot.
265,"Thai Villa is one of the top Thai spots I've been to due to their unique flavors and dish offerings. Plus, it reminds me of Thailand. I keep daydreaming about when I'd go back to Thai Villa and put their delicious flavors in my mouth again...My friend and I were going to split some of the normal entrees until our waiter recommended some privileged and signature entrees for us and it made all the difference! The Royal Pad Thai was unlike anything I'd ever had -- the sauce was thicker, bolder, darker and very different from your regular pad thai. The egg net upped the presentation of this dish and kept the piping hot noodles underneath warm for quite some time. Moo-Obb Nam Puaung (Grilled marinated pork & baby bok choy) was another recommendation from our waiter. This reminded me of the taste of Thailand. The perfectly sweet and salty balance of the pork with the much needed veggies on our trip paired extremely well with a simple fragrant coconut sticky rice. The dipping sauce (fish sauce, chili, lime, etc) also went very well with the rice.Beautiful restaurant decor, exemplary service and excellent food reminiscent of Thailand -- in other words, come try out Thai Villa."
266,I ordered delivery via uber eat. Tom yum fried rice : spicy level is more than you expected. It is flavorful and portion is big. Yummy Short ribs: pretty expensive but they cook the meat so well that it melt in your mouth. The sauce  is also amazing.Pad Thai: it's more flavorful then most of the restaurants. Sometimes there's is good deal in DoorDash or Uber eat and I ended up ordering different items at least 1-2 a month. One of the favorite place around my area.
267,"Go-to weekday Thai delivery spot. The red curry always hits the spot. Their spicy is really spicy, not fake like some of the other restaurants - so careful when you up the spice! Will continue to be my go-to for 14 hr workdays!"
268,"Great lunch spot near flatiron if youre craving thai. I would rate this being better for americans as it does taste a bit more fusion than some other thai restaurants, but nevertheless delicious. The meat is fresh, ive so far tried chicken, beef, and crispy duck. Crispy duck was definitely worth the money. I love the panaang curry, drunken noodles, and pad thai."
269,"Really beautiful and cozy interior that serves both Thai classics and lesser known traditional Thai dishes. We came for dinner right when it opened and were able to get sat right away - we ordered the calamari as a starter, the salmon kaewwan, the khao soi, and two Thai ice teas to finish us off. The Thai iced tea was perfectly sweet and the salmon was delicious and quite large - I was only able to eat half and got to eat the rest for lunch the next day.Their menu is expansive so I would definitely return or order delivery to try other dishes. All the flavors were great and really tasted true to Thai cuisine. I've had a lot of lackluster Thai in the city so glad to have such a reliable spot."
270,"I've always wanted to try this Thai restaurant given a lot of hype from other friends / relatives. I really enjoyed the food and drinks -- I got the shrimp pad Thai and thought it was cooked really well. Super moist and a good size portion, I was super full afterwards! The Thai iced tea was really good too. My boyfriend got the curry and the beef was really tender.However, what would've been a 4.5 star review is being knocked down to a 3 star because of the service. We sat in the upstairs area with a few tables and it felt as if our server was hovering over us and was just standing right next to us while we ate which was uncomfortable and made us feel a little rushed. I can't tell if he was trying to be over-friendly but it came off as extremely brash and rude. On top of that, when trying to pay, he was closely watching and not letting us hold the mobile device where you can pay on the spot. Didn't appreciate that. I tried to grab it so I can privately pay the appropriate tip and it felt, again, very brash."
271,"Loved both the kea mao and basil eggplant chicken, definitely hit the spot. They were not too sweet (which some Thai places can be) with a good kick. I surprisingly enjoyed the tofu in the kea mao; the texture was hearty and felt almost like meat. Portion sizes were generous tooHowever, be prepared for a wait.. we went on a weekday night and waited about 40min to be seated."
272,"Beautifully decorated interiors, food is good. Lunch reservations are easy to get and lots of people were able to get seated for lunch without res. 2 minor quips: they don't seat you until full party is here, meh, would've been nice to start with a drink or app while waiting and 2, they still have the plastic shields up between tables. They're an eyesore and honestly don't do much and makes it hard to get in and out. Theyd be better off just creating some distance. We shared the Kao Tang Na Tung, rice crackers topped with a mixed paste of shrimp, crab and pork. Really creative and good. I had the Kea Mao noodles with tofu as my entree. It was good, could've been a bit spicier for medium spicy and beautifully presented. Portions are on the larger side, great to share a few dishes."
273,"More of a 3.5 but rounding up for our experience. We went as a group of 4 on Saturday and had to wait 30 min for a table during lunch, but it was actually worth because we got, subjectively, the best seats in the house, the 2nd floor terrace overlooking the 1st floor. The decor makes this place fancy, though the food here is just overpriced rather than impressive.We shared a variety of dishes:Chicken pandan leaves - it was very flavorful from being wrapped in pandan leaves, though the portions are a bit on the smaller side even as appetizer.Crispy five spiced duck - there was nothing crispy about this duck. Sauce was sweet and taro chips were well made but a bit lacking in flavor. I don't recommend this dish Pork with sticky rice (moo-obb nam puang) - the pork is quite salty but marinated well, and the bok choy gives a flair of presentation. Sticky rice is good but keep in mind that it is the unsweetened version, which is okay since the pork itself is also a bit sweet.Royal pad thai - this was alright, nothing to write home about. The pad thai is a bit on the sweeter side, though the seafood is fresh. The biggest appeal for this dish is honestly just presentation.Sticky rice with taro - we got this for dessert, and it has a nice salty and sweet finish. It was a bit pricey for what the portions were.Overall, this is a popular place, perhaps even a bit touristy, with nice food presentation, but you are paying a lot for it with food being just average at best compared to other solid Thai places."
274,Very very nice ambiance where the ceiling decor is beautiful and the spacing of the restaurant makes sense. They separated tables with plexiglass so you're not too close to your neighbor.I had a Thai coffee that was delicious and sweet - it must have been from sweetened condensed milk. I also had the pork pad thai that was very good. It was a huge portion. I had leftovers and I think I can eat it for 2 more meals. Great place!
275,"Had been eyeing their lunch special deal for a while... had a day off so I decided to come and try it - my fault that I came on a holiday (they don't serve their lunch special on holidays).Ending up ordering the Gai Yang - chicken was delicious: juicy and tender. Paired nicely with bokchoy and cucumber, along with sticky rice. Pretty solid meal, although a little more than I'd like to pay for lunch ($24).Ambiance is cool - indoor decor is great, and energy is good. It's very popular and it was definitely busy."
276,"The outdoor seating was very cute and warm ! We love that for NYC. My friend and I ordered from the lunch menu and we thought it was a really good deal (around $14-$18). I ordered the green curry and pad kee mao. The green curry was very salty and spicy. It's still really delicious if you can get over the salt here. The coconut milk in the curry is just the right texture - soupy but still thick. The rice, however, was just regular rice. Kinda cold in my opinion. The pad kee mao was super spicy. It's not regular spice. It's the hurting spice that warms you up in a bad way. Please my nose got so runny after taking a couple of bites. Order at your own risk."
277,"Came here on a busy Friday for a party of 2 and was seated immediately at the bar. There was a much longer wait for a table so that didn't bother us. I started off with a mango sunrise mocktail which was delicious, I will say $9 was a bit much for it. As for the entrees, we ordered a pork pad see ew and a green curry (medium spice). The pad see ew was delicious, and the green curry was tasty as well. I thought it'd be spicier since we got it medium spicy, but I was able to handle the spice pretty well. If you're craving Thai food and you're in the area, definitely try this restaurant! It hits the spot."
278,"Came here on a Saturday early afternoon with reservationsFood: ordered the coconut calamari, spring rolls and pad Thai noodles. Also ordered two alcoholic beverages: Sai sa ket sling and the agave with the dragon tattoo. The calamari was amazing, the spring noodles and pad Thai were nothing out of the ordinary... A little lacking in bold flavor to be honest for what they charge i expected great flavor. But ingredients seemed fresh and dishes were cooked to perfect textures. Drinks were delicious. Definitely different and flavorful and strong!Service: i took stars out because the service was not great. Our server was extremely rude, curt and not accomodating. We asked about items traditional to Thai restaurants and before we could finish a sentence we were met with Curt ""no we don't have that... It's not on the menu"". We were asking about sauces. When we asked a different server he brought over what we were asking for no questions asked. She rushed us to order and rushed us to leave by trying to clear our table before we were finished eating. Price: prices were normal for NYC dining. I did feel it was a little steep for portions for appetizers. But entrees and drinks were pr for the course.Ambiance: the decor was probably the best part. Everything, down to the restrooms was classy and culture specific. They did sit our party in a smaller portion of the space, upstairs, which is cramped with tables and loses the feel of the rest of the restaurant which was disappointing.Overall it was a good lunch expect for the service and our seating."
279,"I AM IN THE CONSTANT HUNT FOR THE BEST THAI FOOD IN NEW YORK AND SO FAR THIS IS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST!The whole experience was excellent - from getting an easy reservation online, getting seated pretty quickly (when my whole party got there), ordering what the server recommended, and receiving our food promptly and piping hot. In addition to the fantastic food and service, the decor of this place is also beautiful. I mean - that lighting fixture! They also have outdoor seating as well.One really special, unique thing about Thai Villa is upon opening the menu, they have a quick blurb about how they recommend and specialize in lesser-known Thai dishes, but people typically gravitate towards the more popular Americanized dishes. This inspired us to order one of the more lesser-known items to try out as an appetizer - and we were not disappointed! The server said this was one of his favorite things on the menu. The appetizer was phenomenal. The combination of the rice noodles, peanut sauce, and Thai basil was delicious. But off to the main course... I honestly think the Royal Pad Thai here is the best I've ever had in my life. The portions were large, and the flavor was just perfect. It had the balance of sweet, sour, and salty down to a science. And the presentation - it is a beautiful dish! The noodles were in a cage made with egg! The red curry was good as well, but the pad thai was definitely the star of the show.We will definitely be coming back to Thai Villa - we absolutely LOVE this place and cannot recommend it enough! I'm not sure about delivery, but dine in is incredible!"
280,Thai villa does not disappoint. Beautiful ceiling decoration pictured below that transports you and aids in the cultural experience of their food. The scallop appetizer was delicious just the right amount of salt. My garlic shrimp were very tasty with a good portion of vegetables and very good jasmine rice. The pad see ewe was very good as well and the squid were perfectly cooked.The service from our waitress was great but I think the hostess at the front could have been more welcoming. Overall would recommend and will be back ;).
281,"VIBES: Okay, this place is BEAUTIFUL. This spot is great for a date night, dinner date with a group of friends, or even just a party of 1 like I did hahahah. Stopped in here when I was shopping in the area and I had been dying to try. It definitely lived up to the hype. The decor on the inside is so so pretty and the service was amazing. I originally ordered one thing then changed my mind 5 minutes later and they were super accommodating! DRINKS & FOOD: I started with a Cilantro Cocktail (i forget the actual name) but it was amazing and refreshing and decently strong. Then for the Scallop Skewers which were in this amazing sauce alongside refreshing cucumber which paired perfectly. The scallops were small, but considering the price, it came with a decent amount. As my entree, I got the popular Royal Pad Thai which was actually the BEST PAD THAI i've ver had. Also the egg net added a coolness affect and also kept the noodles HOT and FRESH. This pad thai had a large prawn and a decent amount of shrimp which wasn't over cooked and tasted very fresh.  They included bean sprouts and crushed peanuts on the side which was a nice touch."
282,"An average place for Thai food in the city. I think what attracts most people is the ambiance and pretty decor. I do have to say that the atmosphere is great for a date or to catch up with friends. I had a double date and reserved a table at night on the weekend. We ordered the red curry, chicken pad see ew, soft shell crab mango salad, scallop skewers, chicken pad thai, and crab fried rice. The highlights were definitely the crab dishes such as soft shell crab mango salad and the crab fried rice. They loaded the crab fried rice with plentiful amount of crab on top. The chicken pad thai was also a hit. The curry was comforting. What I was disappointed in was the chicken pad see ew. There was barely any egg in the dish and the chicken was very dry. The flavor was also pretty bland. All around, most of their dishes are good but it doesn't highly impress me. That being said, I still think it is a solid spot if you're looking to dine at a Thai restaurant in Manhattan."
283,"Absolutely love Thai Villa! It is a higher end Thai restaurant in the city which is usually packed during peak hours. Plan to make a reservation in advance or you will be waiting quite a while to get seated. The interior design is absolutely gorgeous, and same goes for their food and plating, a serious A+! My favorite items on the menu has to be their Soft Shell Crab Nam Prig Pao and their Ped Ron (duck). Can't wait to go back again"
284,"I've been here twice now and still can stop dreaming about the red curry. We came here again last week on a Thursday night. Still super busy! Hostess was so accommodating as we requested to move tables. We got the red curry with shrimp, Thai fried rice, kra pao with shrimp and kae mao with shrimp. The red curry is amazing! The flavors! I have to say it's a bit spicy. The Kae Mao was super spicy and think it might have been to much for us. I would recommend the basil fried rice over the Thai. I had that last time and it was amazing.Really good Thai iced tea as wel"
285,Best Thai food in NYC. Great service by Best. He is very professional and great at his job. Would love to visit again
286,"I'm about to make some big claims, so take a seat. This is the BEST Thai food I've had in my life. Yup, I said BEST. No contest. And trust me, due to my mom's selective appreciation for Thai food for most meals we eat outside the house, I've probably been to 98% of the Thai restaurants in Long Island, NYC etc. (and many other cities if we are getting into it). Besides the fact that we may need an intervention into my mother's obsession with Thai food, everyone at our table, could not find a flaw with ANY of the dishes. With a family full of opinionated people, this itself is a feat! Besides the food, the ambiance and decor is beautifully done and elevates the space. The staff was all quick and attentive with their service. All the drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) were made to perfect and well worth the price-tag. Make a reservation by calling earlier in the day, or using Resy as I think they've finally decided to start taking reservations (it used to be via phone call only previously). 200% recommend this spot for a casual evening out or a special occasion, it was a great way to celebrate a birthday, and trust me, your taste buds will thank you!"
287,Had a quick lunch at Thai Villa during a work trip. There was a wait to eat inside (obviously beautiful per photos) so I ate in the street shelter. Surprisingly very warm and nice out there. Food was great. I'll look forward to making a reservation and eating inside next time I'm visiting. Highly recommend.
288,Thai Villa is always my go to spot if I crave for Thai food!!! The place is so spacious we barely have to wait to be seated.
289,"Thai Villa is a hidden gem: it doesn't look like much from the outside but it has gorgeous decor on the inside. I felt transported to SE Asia. The food was delicious and prepared quickly. I requested a Thai Tea with rum which they said used to be a regular drink on the menu, so they knew exactly what to do.I am giving 3 stars because my friends and I felt the silent nudge - and eyes- of being rushed (to order drinks, then food, subsequently dessert and ultimately handed the check) to pay and leave so they could sit another group."
290,Great place for good food when you are so very hungry that you're hangry. They will calm and cool you down with Thai tea ice teas and nearly immediate curry puffs followed quickly with your delicious dining selections. Say yes to the duck!So pretty inside of this multi-level restaurant and the servers are industriously bustling everywhere indoors and out at the on the street booths. I've never seen it not busy yet am always able to get a table and a yummy meal.
291,"Amazing Thai food. The ambience, the food and service is 5-stars. We ordered appetizers: steamed dumplings, spicy chicken wings and egg rolls. Great way to start the meal. Our entrees were just as delightful, red chicken curry, delicious pineapple fried rice and the pad tai noodles. It's was a treat to enjoy a delicious meal. Make sure you have reservations. Enjoy!"
292,One of my favorite restaurants to get Thai food! Great for celebrating a special occasion or for a date night. Not only is the ambiance inside the restaurant beautiful but the food is just as good as the inside looks! Definitely recommend if you're in the area.
293,"If you love Thai food, this is absolutely the place to go! First of all, the interior is simply gorgeous. There are small reflective panels hanging from the ceiling, giving it a shimmering kind of look amidst the dim lighting, which also provides for an intimate vibe. The restaurant is also decorated in an authentic fashion with intricate wood carvings on the tables/benches. Not to mention, there is a nice outdoor seating area as well (though it doesn't come close to how nice the interior is).As for the food, I ordered the Royal Pad Thai, which had pretty standard pad Thai ingredient with prawns, except was way better than normal. Like the restaurant itself, this dish was presented beautifully. The noodles were wrapped in an egg net (egg in a lattice pattern around it), while the chive leaves sticking out of the dish topped off (literally) the appearance. Furthermore, the dish tasted so good- the noodles were so flavorful, both sweet and savory and were perfectly cooked. The $24 price was a tad pricey, but even still, I would say that the Royal Pad Thai is truly suitable for royalty.On top of this, the service was great too. The staff were very friendly and attentive. Plus, the service speed was fast. I even noticed that the staff themselves were actually Thai, which is a testament to the authenticity of this restaurant.Overall, Thai Villa is the best Thai place I've been to in NYC and definitely one of the best I've ever visited. With a beautiful interior and great authentic Thai food, Thai Villa is truly a must-visit place!"
294,Dined here in mid August for my cousin's birthday dinner and had a decent time. Our waitress did an incredible job at memorizing our order (a total of 8 of us) and we managed to get our food and drinks in a timely fashion. I went with my go-to (pineapple fried rice with chicken) and rose for my drink. We unfortunately dined outside due to availability but I was looking forward to seeing the inside of the venue. The waitress kindly took a handful of photos of us at the conclusion of our dinner. We gave here a well deserved tip.
295,"We love Thai food, and this was one of the best Thai restaurant experiences we've ever had. The food was fantastic, and the place had great ambiance. And the prices are quite reasonable as well.We tried various dishes including Krapraw Gai Sub (ground chicken), tofu fried rice, Basil leaves, and Praram. All had great flavor, and the perfect amount of spice. The Praram was a unique dish as it was tofu covered in peanut sauce, with veggies. They cook the tofu in a unique way at Thai Villa, and it has a little more crisp to it than at most Thai places. The Tom Yum Koong soup with Shrimp was also very flavorful. The drink menu is also huge here. We will definitely be back here when we come back to NYC. They are on Resy, and prime dinner slots go really quickly."
296,"I came here for dinner the other day with friends and we loved this place! The interior decor is super cute and you have great mood/lighting at the tables. We decided to do family style so that we could try a couple of different dishes. To start we got the Papaya Salad. For our main dishes, we got the Tofu Pad See Ew, Royal Pad Thai and Tofu Pineapple Fried Rice. Honestly, everything was very tasty. The pad thai was from their special which featured jumbo shrimp and was plated so fancy. Personally, my favorite dish was the pad see ew. The flavors were just so good and the noodles were done perfectly. Would love to come back!"
297,"4.5 if that was an option. Tbh their red curry was the star, I love all the veggies and flavor that went into it. The curry puff wrapper was super flaky and buttery (my fav) but the filling lacked actual curry flavor. The pad see ew was a bit too salty and also lacked a bit of the crispy noodle texture from the wok, otherwise the ingredients were super fresh and delicious. Thai tea was amazing TBHALSO THEIR OUTDOOR DINING WAS SUPER CUTE"
298,The Tom Jued soup WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Will be back!! Beautiful restaurant. Pad Thai also delicious.
299,"Returned here for dinner and had a good time. The service was rushed but it's a very busy place so I understand they want you in and out. Do not expect to linger over a drink after eating here. The food was great- the highlights being the red curry and the shrimp with lime leaves (I think that's what it was!) the salmon dish I would skip next time. It's an expensive meal, but it's a step or two above the standard neighborhood Thai and the space is lovely."
300,"I've been searching for quality Thai food in NYC since I moved here and I think I finally found the best spot!First off, the food here is premiere quality- it's not oily, its very well seasoned, and has the perfect balance of spice and savory. I got the kee mao with chicken and definitely recommend it! I do wish there was more chicken and a little less vegetables- that would make it perfect. The vibes here are really nice- cool lighting and ceiling decorations. The only thing I really didn't like about my experience was how hot it was inside. I'm not sure if the a/c wasn't working or not but I was sweating the entire time so I hope they fix that. Overall, it was a great experience and I'll be back."
301,"Overall- I would come back What we got Good:Pad Thai- over the years I have grown more fond of pad kee mao or pad see ew but we decided to change it up. I will say they do a fantastic job. The right combination of tamarind and citrus. Loved it Ok:Penang curry- it was a great curry, on the spicy side. It was a little bit of a thinner curry but to their credit it's probably because they use less coconut milk and they just rely on the flavors of the spices to make the dish. I think I would have liked it more if the beef was the same as they used in the pad Thai. The beef in the curry wasn't as good of a cut. Still a great dish but it probably would have been better with chicken Price: expensive. $20ish per dish. Very good quality stuff though Ambiance: very cool space. The chandeliers are beautiful and even the handles on the bathroom doorknobs were super cool. Very much a modern take on traditional thai decor Pro tip- we got lucky for Sunday lunch because we came early and could sit inside. The outside is definitely not the same vibe. If you have any interest in coming here make a reservation"
302,"Never disappoints! Good food, service, and ambianceFollow me on instagram @eatenbysteph"
303,"My friend and I ate dinner on Thursday. We ordered pad thai and crispy duck to share. The entree portions are big. Overall the service is great. If you make a reservation online, they inform you that they will charge $30 if you cancel or a no show."
304,"Top notch dish selection and great value menu. We often order takeout from here on Caviar, and the food arrives fresh and in good condition (often not the case with other restaurants)."
305,"I absolutely love Thai Villa. The first time I had Thai Villa was when I ordered food from here via Uber Eats. I had ordered the Tom Yum Fried Rice and Pad Thai with Tofu. The fried rice was delicious, I've never had an entree like it. You could really taste and smell the tom yum flavor in the rice and I especially liked the small mushrooms used in this dish. The pad thai was average, it didn't stand out as anything special.After enjoying the takeout order so much, a friend and I stopped by here for dinner after work one day. We didn't have a reservation but figured we didn't need one on a Wednesday night. When we got to the restaurant around 7:30pm, we were told that if we were okay with sitting at the bar, there was no wait but if we wanted a table, there would be a 45 minute wait. Pro tip: make a reservation if you're planning on eating here because it is VERY busy.The crowd makes sense too - the service and the food are just so good. I ordered the kee mao noodles with tofu and a thai iced tea and they did not disappoint. Our server was really friendly and made sure to check on us periodically, despite how busy the restaurant was. When we were done eating, he also packed up our leftovers for us. Some places just hand you the takeout box and make you pack your food, but we really appreciated how this place took care of you. The service here was great - fast and efficient even with the high number of customers in the restaurant. I'm sure I'll be back at this restaurant in the near future."
306,"We went there for a lunch after a friend's recommendation. The ambiance was very pretty. We ordered Tom Kha soup, Pad Se Ew, Green Curry. There's Fish oil used in Pad Thai noodles so vegetarian, be aware about that before you order. The food was super yum. Everything was delicious and generous in portion. We will definitely go back when in town next."
307,"I have been wanting to visit this place for years since I only hear great things about it, so I finally did it. I considered my self a Thai food fanatic, having been to Thailand plenty of times I think I have enough knowledge to know when a Thai dish taste authentic and when it's just okay. We ordered a Tom Yum and soft shell crab mango salad. The soup was tasty but the broth was kind of thick (I believe it has coconut milk in it) but the flavors were there. We also ordered the mango salad, it was good and the perfect amount of spiciness, however, it was missing the dried baby shrimp (deal breaker when it comes to papaya or mango salad) other than it was an okay appetizer course. As main dishes I got the pineapple fried rices which it was good, I like the fact that they used fresh pineapple and not from the can (lots of place used canned pineapple for this dish), the chicken was tender and the rice had a GOOD amount of it. I also ordered the pad see ew with pork which it was very good as well. The pork was tasty and it complement the noodles very well. I have a few issues with this place and that is the amount of food they serve (it's massive) I know they need to justify what they charge for rice but I think cutting back on prices and serving regular portions is a better practice. Another thing is the menu, I mean look at it before you go there because it is a whole will. You will get pages, and pages of what it seems to me very repetitive food just phrases differently. Has it been the best Thai food I've ever had in the city? Absolutely NO. Was it terrible? No, it was not, it was okay. Will I go back? Maybe in a few months. Would I recommend it? As your last option sure!"
308,"Highly Recommended!!! The food and the decorations is 10/10. I took my boss and his family to visit and they love Thai Vila! We order variety of food and never forget to add the Thai Milk Tea  ""Best"" was the one who taking care of us and making us many drinks tonight! He is very helpful and we love him so much! I highly recommended if you are looking for good food, good atmosphere and friendly staff here is the perfect place!"
309,"I bookmarked Thai Villa after reading about this place on multiple blogs and was pleasantly surprised that it was around the corner after visiting the HP store next to the Flat Iron building. Didn't have a reservation, but was instantly seated indoors.The ambiance of the restaurant is great with all the golden decors and I appreciate the plexiglass dividers during COVID.I ordered the lunch special for pad see ew, which also came with mushroom soup and slice of chive pancake. I enjoyed the soup - It was light with cabbage and enoki mushrooms. Chive pancake had an interesting texture and didn't taste too bad with the dipping sauce. Pad see ew, on the other hand, was just okay in my opinion. Nothing really stood out in terms of taste. My friend really enjoyed his Panang curry and Thai iced tea though!"
310,"Went today, got a square pepperoni slice. Was kinda burnt tbh and not much pepperoni. 1 pepperoni square slice cost 6 dollars cash or $6.27 if you pay by card. The crust was very burnt and hard to eat, would have liked more sauce and cheese as well. Was it worth it? For me, it wasn't but you might have a different opinion."
311,"The pepperoni square is pretty good,  but I wouldn't wait on line for it. It's a bit greasy too!"
312,I went to this place after hearing about it so many times. And boy oh boy am I glad I did! Pizza was awesome! I waited on line for about 15 - and it was well worth the wait!!
313,Prince St Pizza was some of the best pizza I have tasted in a long time... the atmosphere was lively & busy. Once I tasted the pizza I completely understood why! The walls adorn celebrity photographs throughout the small stand only pizzeria. There is outdoor seating in the front of the store. The sodas are just as amazing as the generous slices of pizza. Make sure you add Prince St to your list when visiting NY.
314,Overall they have good pizza. I tried a pepperoni square and a regular cheese. The pepperoni square was very good with good tasting sauce and lots of pepperoni. There was not much cheese. The regular cheese was disappointing. The sauce was bland compare to the square. It was OK but I would not travel for a cheese slice. I have had much better in NYC.
315,I stopped in here on a Sunday afternoon. The line was not very long and the service was very quick. I was in and out in about 5 minutes. I ordered a slice of the pepperoni and the pesto. I enjoyed the pepperoni more. The pepperoni was a bit spicy.
316,"Prince street was pretty good. The square slice good, but too much sauce tho. The pepperoni themselves on the pizza were so good. Other Pizza slice was cold and the slice was not crispy also still cold. Service staff and the register was rude and the girl was mad we wanted to add a soda to our order after we ordered the slices. Glad we came, but lots of other pizza with nice staff and a hot fresh slice.  I would maybe come again only for square slice."
317,"Ordered: Spicy Spring Slice, Vodka Fra Diavolo Square SliceI've been wanting to try Prince St. Pizza for a while now and all I can say is - so overhyped! I don't understand why people rave about their pizza.  Spicy Spring Slice - Topped with mozzarella, their secret homemade spicy sauce, and pepperoni. The first thing I noticed was the pools of oil in each pepperoni slice. In addition to the abundance of oil on the pepperoni, the pizza itself was just very greasy and not at all appetizing.   Vodka Fra Diavolo Square Slice - Made with a combination of their homemade spicy sauce and vodka sauce. Let's just start off with the lack of spice. The sauce was not spicy at all.  Both slices were excessively doughy, and the crusts were very crunchy and dry. Unless you enjoy super doughy, greasy pizzas, I'd stay away."
318,"This definitely lives up to the hype!  I went for the classic Spicy Spring Pepperoni Cups.  It's very tasty, but I definitely wouldn't describe it as spicy. For some reason, food that's well seasoned will be often be described as spicy.Do your best to go off-peak when the line isn't long. I happen to be in the area on a bad weather day, so I was able to avoid the usual commotion and long lines. I'm a firm believer of avoiding long waits because I do not think think a cookie, donut, pizza etc. are worth 2 hour waits.I'm taking off one star because the outdoor setup is not the best. Just a couple stools outside on a very narrow sidewalk that sees a lot of foot traffic. Inside there are ledges against each wall with room to eat like many pizza joints, but you're not allowed to eat in there. I will be back (off-peak) to try some other slices."
319,"For meat eaters, this popular pizza joint makes sense. For non meat eaters, such as myself, I would say to pass. They are most famous for the vodka sauce pizza (has meat) and the spicy pepperoni pizzas. We got the Margarita pizza and a slice of veggie. Both are just average and better at many other pizza spots. There was a long line out the door around 6pm on a Sunday, which is to be expected. There are a few bar seats outside if you can snag one."
320,It's one of my favorite places to visit and enjoy food and drinks. The atmosphere is great and it feels like you are partially in Burger  Lobster in London. The interior is great and really fits the mood. I would not order food online but rather go to the restaurant to experience this unique atmosphere that transports you to another country.
321,"A fantastic experience!  If you're a fan of burgers and/or lobster rolls, this is a can't miss place to go. The menu is short, which is usually a good sign for me as that typically means they put a lot of effort in the options listed. Arrived around 6pm on a Friday, and the location is spacious with outdoor seating and was able to be seated right away. The server immediately attended the table and gave the option of a scan menu or paper menu. I opted for scan. Out of all the great sounding choices, I landed on what is called ""The Rolls"" which is a London Burger, lobster roll, fries and salad at a VERY reasonable price. The burger was perfectly cooked medium rare as requested. It was wonderful. The shaved pickles was a great idea as you get the taste of pickle in your bite without pulling the entire pickle out of the sandwich. The lobster roll came chilled, but in a toasty bun and a side of a warm buttery sauce to balance the chill with delicious warmth. The fries were of great quality and reminded me of the best version of McDonalds fries. And was perfect for the meal. Sadly, as good as the salad looked, it was for decoration as the two sandwiches and fries was the perfect amount of food.  And washed it down with what they list as ""The Beer"". A crisp Pale Ale from Sixpoints brewery. The place looked great in space and decorThe staff was friendly and prompt. And the food was absolutely amazing. I look forward to making my way there again in the near future."
322,"And to spot last night For my friend's birthday. We brought in a cake for him and they were able to hold it and bring it out when it was time to say happy birthday. The decor and environment is nice. Unfortunately we were sat next to the kitchen so it was a bit loud but it was nice seeing the pace of the workers cooking all the dishes. We decided to get some drinks to try out. The drinks were decent but they seemed light on the alcohol. We had the strawberry fizz, passion fruit margarita, espresso martini and a max park punch. The margarita and the espresso martini were the best drinks out of the ones we had chosen. I also had one non alcoholic mocktail drink: the hibiscus and passionfruit (with mint). Absolutely delicious!! For appetizers we decided to share the burrata, calamari, fresh raw oysters, lobster Mac and cheese and lobster bisque.  The oysters were fresh but small. The burrata was cold. However, the calamari and the lobster Mac and cheese is a must for the table. I can still taste the Mac now (drool). For our entrees, some of us got burgers (beyond, dry age, & london), the original lobster (option of grilled or steamed), one b&l combo (burger and lobster), and one big boy lobster catch of the day! I would recommend the steamed over grilled for move juice and it's easier when cracking it. The food was good. Burgers i wouldn't order here i feel like seafood is more of their thing. The big boy we had was 3.14 lbs and was $170. All entrees come out with fries and a house salad. We substituted some as truffle fries. The bout boy however comes with unlimited of the salad and fries and butter. The garlic butter sauce that comes with the lobsters are absolutely amazing. It was a creamy butter i didn't even know i was missing in my life. I was saying i hope o don't break out for the amount of butter i was eating... even with my fries! Fries dipped in butter....YUM!!! My rating is off of the burgers and comes with a bit of the service. The service was also a bit slow to bring little things we asked for like water or lemons or even new utensils. they offered to cut the cake for us and at the end we saw a charge of it. Now i get that some locations charge for it but it should have been mentioned when dropping off the cake just to have a heads up. Fortunately for me money wasn't an issue but to some it might. LASTLY... the reason for a FULL star drop was because of how one of our waiters approached us on the big boy when we ordered. He pushed for us to see the lobster and my friend just wanted it cooked. The waiter came back about the lbs of the lobster 3 times and on the last time he said and i quote.. ""Excuse me but i do not want fo make this a thing but the price of the lobster is $170. Are u sure you want it?"" It came across as discriminatory since we were colored people in a fancy restaurant who probably didn't exactly look the part (we were going to a club after) and we had said yes 3x!!! I just would never have done that when i was a waitress. I would have stated the lbs and price when explaining the big boy rather than coming back and forth making us feel like they couldn't believe we had the funds to cover our dinner. Overall. Great spot to go. Definitely a nice place for GOOD lobster (and i don't like lobster)!"
323,"Our party of 9 tried B&L out for restaurant week. The decor is cute. It's not too chic but it's nothing like a ""family"" Restaurant.The staff was kind from the start of dinner through the end. The drinks were good as well.Here's where it gets tricky...the food. The food was nothing to run home about. We started with burger and lobster bites. Very hit or miss. The lobster bites had a strange taste to them.The burger was good but nothing to tell a friend about. The dessert was served in an off glass container but was good nonetheless.Would I come back? Probably notWould I recommend it to a friend? Ehhh"
324,"Imagine, if you will, a restaurant in New York City with burgers and lobsters. That place is in Flatiron ... and you've entered the Alright Zone  ... cause everything is acceptably adequate at Burger and Lobster.   Original Lobster Roll - 3.5 stars Lobster Bisque - 3 stars The London Burger - 2.5 stars Truffle Fries - 3.5 stars Cocktails - 3 stars Service - 4 stars  Anna Delvey wouldn't be impressed. My spouse wasn't either ... even though Burger & Lobster - Flatiron NYC is an a-ok 3 stars for having favorites I love ... like cocktails, bisque, truffle fries, burgers, and lobster. Each are just worthy of being in the McConaughey zone as alright, alright, alright ..."
325,"Great burgers, Lobster, Salads and more. I had the Burger and lobster bites, French toast and the beast burger were delicious. Their salads are also delicious. The service was great. Decor nice also. I believe they have a location in Bryant Park and others around the world."
326,"We stopped here after walking around the city for awhile with our two kids.  They verified our COVID vaccine cards before seating us.  The staff was very helpful, friendly and accommodating to our family. We started off with calamari which was excellent. Our kids really enjoyed their burger bites, it was a perfect kid friendly menu item. For our main dish we had the dry-aged burger which was topped with blue cheese. This burger was perfectly cooked, juicy and full of flavor. The fries were very crispy and delicious. The salad provided a light fresh element to the dish.  The lobster roll was full of flavor, excellent pieces of lobster.  I also highly recommend the margaritas here, they are very delicious."
327,"Having based my experience only off of a delivery order during the peak of the pandemic, it probably was not a great way to judge how great this restaurant is. So came here during restaurant week and dragged my gf with me for dinner ($39 deal). The place was enormous and very lively. Seems like a great spot to grab some food and drinks after work, have a family gathering, or have a date (if you don't mind the noise). We shared each others dishes so we could try various items they had to offer.For appetizers, we order the Butternut Squash Soup and Burrata. Cannot go wrong with either choices. The soup is more filling if you're super hungry. For entrees, we ordered the B&L Steak Sandwich and the Truffle Lobster Roll (extra $5). You get a choice between B&L fries or a salad with your entree. I personally don't think the Truffle Lobster Roll is worth the extra $5. Didn't really taste any truffle flavor and it wasn't as filling one would hope. The B&L Steak Sandwich will definitely fill you up a lot better than the Lobster Roll. Did I mention the B&L Steak Sandwich also tastes amazing? Must be that caramelized onion and roasted garlic mayo. For dessert we got the Cheesecake Mousse and Chocolate Mousse. We ended up having them packed to take with us as we were both already stuffed after finishing our entree. I personally enjoyed the Cheesecake Mousse more.Overall, a three course meal for $39 is one hell of a deal, especially if it puts you into a food coma just after the second course. Service is fantastic. Come check this place out during restaurant week while it last!"
328,"Love it here! Firstly, the staff here is so engaging, friendly & attentive. Even if they're not your waiter/tress, they will go out of their way to assist. Now for the food: get the garlic butter. No matter what. Dip your fries in them, dip your bread, everything!!!! So addictive. Love getting the poboy lobster roll, calamari and steamed lobster whenever I come here. All so juicy, full of flavor, and doesn't feel extremely heavy the next day."
329,"Came here for dinner last weekend after making reservations on Google (they had plenty of open spots even the day before). Pretty empty and spaced out tables which I liked. Burrata- 10/10. Mainly because of the tomato sauce it comes with. just added an extra oomph to the cheese. The toasted roll they gave us was slightly burnt on the edges (not sure if that was done purposefully to bring out flavor but I personally avoided those parts)Roll Combo- 8/10. I ordered this cause you get the best of both worlds- burger & lobster! The London burger was super basic in my opinion, the main thing i liked about it was the sesame bun and the pickled onions. Other than that it was a regular ole burger. The Lobster roll however was 10/10 on its own! The lemon'ed up lobster on this delicious toasted brioche roll was just PERFECT. Tip: ask for the lemon butter sauce ($3) on the side to bring your lobster roll to the next level. I didn't love the sauce that much but my husband sure did.The main reason I give it 4 and not 5 stars is because I didn't love the burger.Special shoutout for service...our waiter was absolutely PHENOMENAL. He was so attentive, easy going, and kind. He had great energy and even said ""thank you"" to US for pointing out a mistake on the bill! Service was also super quick, the food came out fast and we were done in 50 minutes. With the receipt they give you this electronic tablet so you can rate your dishes and experience which I obviously loved and was excited to do!The ambiance and the whole vibe is pretty cool too. If you didnt know about B&L already, youd think its a fast food burger joint but the interior is so classy and well decorated, a total vibe.Return? Probably, esp if Im ever craving a lobster roll.Recommend? Defintely! Fancy date night feel but without the fancy cost."
330,"Burgers, lobsters, cocktails, and desserts. Oh my!This place was jumping on the night we dropped in. Cool looking spot. Fun and not pretentious. Great music too.Juicy and delicious burgers. Lobster roll actually loaded with fresh lobstah! French fries crispy with a right amount of saltiness. Little side salad too. As there is a full bar we ordered off of their house cocktail list and had some refreshing libations. Overall price aligns with the quality, but it's definitely not a cheaper meal experience.Oh, and those desserts in the specialty glass jars - YUM!"
331,"If you like lobster but you also like burgers then look no further cause this is the place for you. Who says you can't have the best of both worlds? Cause over here, you can have the best of both worlds and not skimp out on portion sizes. You can get a full lobster roll and a full burger with fries and salad for a nice combined combo price. That's what I got when I came. I was feeling a bit of both a lobster roll and also a burger so I got the combo and to my surprise, it was a half portion of one and another half of the other dish but two full portions. It was great! Of course I couldn't finish it all but the lobster roll was delicious and the burger was perfectly cooked. My gf got the salad with a serving of lobster on top and it was a great serving size as well. The food here is great and don't mind getting yourself messy if you do in fact go for the whole lobster...you won't have to travel to New England for that experience.The atmosphere is very much reflective of a typical NYC restaurant as opposed to a seafood restaurant you'd find in New England but it has very good casual vibes. There is a full service bar so in case you just want drinks then they'll accommodate that as well."
332,Great place in the city. Atmosphere was nice and service was pleasant. I got the lobster with fries and comes with a side salad. The food taste good. Not the best lobster roll I've had but not bad at all either. I would return
333,"I've been here a few times and have enjoyed myself each time. They have a happy hour menu that offers pretty great deals. For some odd reason, during lunch time, this place is fairly empty--but it's truly a great spot! My first time here I ordered oysters (2.5 out of 5 stars), calamari (4 out of 5), house wine (2.5 out of 5), and grilled lobster(3.5 out of 5). To be honest, they were all just okay. My second visit is what elevated my score. I had the burger, which was amazing! (Definite 5 out of 5!) and opted for some other wines on the list (that were not part of happy hour). Wine (4 out of 5). It's a nice fairly casual spot to stop for lunch, or to have a drink. I haven't had dinner here yet, but have heard nice things. I'd recommend checking them out. Especially during happy hour."
334,Yum yum gimme some. So delicious! Food was delicious and service was pretty good! There was tons of open tables but they saw fit to sit us next to where wait staff was folding napkins... very odd. But the place was cool and we thoroughly enjoyed our food.
335,Burger and lobster is the nameAnd burger and lobster is exactly what I got. Perfect exactly what I wanted .I wanted to go back again and again .
336,Great service and food was awesome. Cool atmosphere. Will be going back and bringing friends.
337,"Good dining experience! Tried Restaurant Week and got calamari and the burger -- super filling! Both were very decent sizes and fries were also really good that came with the burger.I didn't get to try the lobster but I thought the burger was good, not the best in my life but still worth to try!Friendly service and overall good experience for a date night!"
338,"Where do I begin.  Came here for dinner on a random Sunday.  Prior to covid shut down this was my go to place.  Host were very inviting and nice.  Sat at the bar. Came here solo.  The bartender took my order and my food came out relatively quickly.  First thing I noticed the fries were cold.  Second, ordered the grilled lobster and found it to be watery - I truly hope it wasn't frozen.  I found the bartender inattentive.  1- I asked for a straw.  It's still COVID.  He comes back with my straw touching all then of his fingers and both palms. Gross. He should've gotten a napkin.  I had to ask for condiments.  :(. Twice he came over and asked if I was done.  I clearly was still eating!After I put my napkin on my plate someone came over to move my plate.  I then asked for the bill/ check.  Original bartender is called over.  Then from about 10 feet away from me (he's standing at the computer/Register) he yells my total.  what the hell is wrong with this dude?Am I at McDonald's or Burger King?  Give me my bill. I didn't ask for the total - I don't want other people to know what I am paying for my meal.  I was totally disgusted.   Especially considering that other people were at the bar and he didn't do that when they checked out.  Also - the prices went up.  Definitely NOT worth it. I will never come back to this place. Terrible"
339,"The menu was small and to the point. The lobster Mac 'n' Cheese was nothing to write home about. However, this is the best lobster roll I've ever had! The bread to lobster ratio was perfect, (I wouldn't complain if there were more lobster), the bread was toasted and buttered to perfection, and the ratio of mayo to lobster was right on point and perfectly seasoned. Even the fries were cooked to perfection. I had to ask for more salad dressing but once I got that, the salad was really good too. To sum it up, I had great food, great company and a great meal!"
340,It's always a treat to come here - what's better than burgers and lobsters? I normally get a lobster roll but I got the burger this time - oh boy! What a delicious juicy burger. I upgraded my fries to truffles and that was a disappointment. The regular fries were thinner and crispier - the truffle fries were fatter and soggy.
341,"Great food and nice environment. It's not common to have such a huge dining hall in NYC and I felt like I was in the south or Midwest when I sat in the restaurant. We ordered the wagyu beef burger. It was good, but no as juicy as I expected. The bun also made it a bit dry. The lobster roll was delicious. The $31 burger price was the reason why I gave it 4 stars because I was expecting something that could blow my mind but it didn't (just a tasty burger)."
342,"I've been to Burger & Lobster at least 5-6 times by now over the last couple of years, and their quality has been very consistent each time I visit. For $28-ish you can get a lobster, fries, and side salad (it used to be closer to $20 in the past, but the price has gone up a lot). The highlight of the meal is the deliciously sinful lemon garlic butter sauce, which is probably more butter than one should be allowed to consume in a single setting, but it is just so good that you would find yourself putting it on everything. I mean, I found myself dipping my fries in it. Speaking of the fries, they are fresh, hot and crispy each time!I prefer the lobster steamed rather than grilled, but you really can't go wrong with either option. The burger is a bit overrated/mediocre in my option, but they do have a meal that comes with a full sized lobster and a mini sized burger if you can't choose between the two.Also, it is worth noting that this is a huge restaurant inside and great for large groups. There can be a wait during peak times (~30 minutes or so on weekends and Fridays) but they let you reserve tables online now, which is really helpful."
343,"We had a nice dinner experience here. We started with the burrata and beet salad which were both good. Their burrata was exceptionally creamy. The salads that come with the meal are also well appointed and flavorful. Two of us ordered burgers, one of their standard burgers and one of their fancy dry-aged burgers. The other two ordered lobster. The burgers were both fine, not the best burgers we've ever had but they were okay. The lobster was good, and for the relatively low price, we would come back here to try it again. The fries were not great which was disappointing. We felt quite rushed throughout the meal. We told the waiter we did not want to order the main dishes until we started the appetizer, he was not happy with that. The rest of the meal he barely came by, we had to flag other waiters down for extra napkins, salt etc. He asked us before we were done eating if we could pay before he left because his shift was almost over. Maybe we want a dessert, maybe we wanted more drinks? I get it, but not helping the rushed feeling. I'd say this is a good place to come if you're not a seafood snob and just want to eat lobster or a burger for a relatively low price."
344,"Casual place, felt kind of like chain inside (i guess they have restaurants around the world), but the food and service were great!Alvin was our super server, attentive and friendly.Had ""The Beer,"" a pale ale exclusively brewed for them by sixpoint. it was ok.The half dozen east coast oysters i got were on point tho, briny with seawater the way i like them.  My son had thr original burger which was tasty, and i had a perfect lobster roll. Sooo chunky and meaty lobster in a buttery toasty roll.  the side salad it came with was nice and the fries were pretty perfect."
345,Second Time here! Let's start off with the Bomb Lobster bisque Amazing! The truffle fries also great my lobster was grilled to perfection My drink was Good also Madison park punch a must try!!Will be returning Again
346,"Literally the best of both worlds in this super fun place!!The atmosphere gets you into the vibe the moment you step foot in the door- energetic but not nauseating, perfectly balanced lighting, and music that will instantly elevate your mood. The food? Better than I expected and truly the star of this show. I highly recommend the lobster and burger bites appetizer!! So much delicious goodness nestled inside of delicate puff pastry, you'll start doing your happy dance instantly! Definitely try the B&L combo- the burger and lobster where you get a choice of steamed or grilled lobster and the burger is served on a really delicious seeded bun that complements vs competes. I especially enjoyed the red sangria chock full of fresh drunken fruit! Lastly, the incredibly friendly and professional staff made my entire experience so enjoyable that I'm back just 1 week later for more"
347,"No exaggeration - I was extremely let down with my experience today As a frequent customer over the years - this place took a 360* in so many ways. Love the renovations on the bar - upgraded to a mature, sexy look. The food took a turn for the worst. They no longer have the lobster bisque and the steamed lobster came out undercooked, mushy and inedible. Also they skimped on the amount of lobster provided. It was a slap to the face, barely any meat. I exchanged for a grilled option. Was not a fan. The lemon garlic sauce was bomb. As usual. The bread on the burger kept crumbling and breaking, indicating that the bread was old. It was just blahhh. The cocktail that Adam, the bartender, made was nice - he provided great service, loved his attitude and energy. The manager had a nice outfit. His energy was appreciated as well. The restaurant had one job and it was to deliver a great experience. They missed their mark."
348,"Great place for lobster rolls, bisque, and burgers. The menu is not overwhelming and everything is very delicious. Friendly staff and nice interior - whether it is for lunch or dinner, you'll like coming here. Prices are a bit above average, but worth it."
349,"I have been here before and I am basing my review on my last visit. This was a on weekend afternoon and there was no wait and got seated promptly outside. Got the burger with cheese, medium well. It was very juicy and tasty. Solid burger.Service was great. If I'm in the mood for lobster roll and I am around the neighborhood, I will def stop by again. * they do not have honey mustard."
350,"I love lobster and qualityLobster rolls are hard to find, Delicious lobster roll  with truffle fries (combo) My boyfriend had the burger which was also very tasty.Cocktails were yummy and waiter helped us with the menu as it was our first time."
351,I love this place. Good vibe and play great music. Nice wine and spirits selection. The lobster was so flavorful. My favorite was the burger. The bacon was crispy and burger was cooked to perfection. Awesome place to go to in NYC
352,"Here on Halloween, & feeling the spirit.Staff is in full swing, dressed to the teeth. Service is always pleasant & top notch. Food is on point as well, love this place."
353,The roll is tiny and they had no chips... just bad fries... I've had better lobster rolls.
354,"I brought a friend who wanted a lobster meal and I choose this restaurant based on the high volume  of good reviews. Overall I would give it 3.75-4*.Atmosphere: spacious 4.5*Service: 4.5*Food: 3.75*As the name states, they have a very limited menu. The other person was allergic to shellfish but enjoyed her burger with truffle fries.My friend seemed to enjoy her lobster.I ordered the burger and lobster with sweet potato fries. My criticism is that my meal did not arrive hot and the burger which I requested be cooked medium was overcooked. My cocktail was in a tiny glass.We did have a nice time and we were not rushed which was great since my friend needed time to savor her lobster."
355,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Burger & Lobster after visiting here over 100 times lol. This is one of my favorite places when it comes to grilled lobster. The prices are very different from when they first opened but nonetheless, still worth it. The menu has also expanded as all they initially served was burgers & lobster. I've tried pretty much everything on the menu and although my tastebuds are different from your tastebuds, everything is tasty. I'm not a big burger person so I'll never order it again but it's juicy and filling.  I've had it twice and could never finish it. All entree menu items comes with fries and a salad and butter for your lobster. The lemon & garlic butter is so good I usually order a second one for my French fries. You can walk in or make a reservation and they are taking all Covid precautions like taking your temperature and contact tracing. They have another location in Time's Square but as of now, they are still closed.As soon as indoor dining resumed, I had to stop by and pay a visit. I love their strawberry Margarita and they also have a happy hour menu.Enjoy!"
356,"This was my first dine in experience since COVID so it's been a while. I tried this Burger & Lobster location and the Times Squares location. This location is better by far when it comes to food and wait time. I made a reservation today at 5:30PM and there was no wait. When I arrived, someone checked our vaccination cards and ID at the door so it was nice to see that Burger and Lobster was taking COVID safety seriously. I was then allowed inside where I checked in again and was seated by the host. Everyone seemed to be nicely spaced apart. There was a table between my table and the other customers. I ordered the Lobster roll and my husband ordered the B&L combo. The prices of the items have went up since the last time I went there and there are also alot more choices on the menu. The Lobster roll was $29 and the B&L combo was $42. The Lobster roll came with fries and a salad and the B&L came with the same thing. We got the burger medium well and grilled lobster. We always order both and split our food. My Husband said the lobster roll was a little dry today but I thought it was good but I also haven't had lobster in over a year. The grilled lobster was a little burnt so some parts tasted a little bitter today. Normally, this doesn't happen so I'm giving the restaurant the benefit of the doubt. The burger was okay.The service has always been very consistent so no complaints on that either."
357,"Walking by we decided to escape the city heat and humidity in exchange for string cocktails and air conditioning.  There have outdoor seated as well. We enjoyed blueberry cocktails,  a fling and a Madison punch. All were strong and tasty. We also got lobster bites and steak lobster skewers (that had more veggies than meat ) service was fast/ friendly and a group effort which is nice. It's all about teamwork. As we chatted and laughed, others were watching the flatscreens. Great spot- lots of space in a Covid world. Will be back."
358,Food & service is always amazing. Delicious and great portions of lobster. The wait is usually pretty long on weekends but weekdays is much smoother. They've expanded their menu a lot and I think I prefer less option but the lobster portions are always great and delicious.
359,"Place is located in a nice area of the city with much to do and see. I happened to want to check this spot out because of the number of reviews for a burger spot.      Outside looks nice without all that congestion the city streets bring. I personally don't like sitting outside eating my food enabling exhaust but the restaurant does a good job deflecting that type of environment. Walking in I was taken back on how large this place is. Great for large groups or even a more intimate setting by the bar. It's a very casual attire type of place like a burger spot should be and fun atmosphere.      I sat at the bar where it took a minute before I was catered to. I had decided to order their original burger. I like the care and attention of the ingredients. Pickles shaved nicely to eat, option of the bun with everything seed. Their secret sauce didn't stand out in my option but did add a light creamy texture the burger needed. The party was a well grade meat but besides that nothing spectacular. I first bit into it and flowed with juices but after two more bites it loss it's appeal. Feel it needed seasoning into the patty. I'm glad I came by and tried the burger because it was much better than most places I visited. Next time I'm going to try their Lobster Roll. The truffle fries were an 8 out of 10 in flavor and better than most places I been too but a bit soggy on the bottom. The salad seemed like an odd side added to the meal but it was quite refreshing after eating the burger.      The old fashion was another 8 out 10 from other places I visited. They used Woodford Reserve Kentucky straight whisky bourbon. Even without the black cherries it still maintained a hint of sweetness."
360,"This review is pre-pandemic, but needed a shoutout in 2021 because the spread was delicious! Burger & Lobster is conveniently located in Mid-town, blocks away from Time Square. For two people, we got the ""Brunch Combo for one"" which included a 6 oz. burger, 1 lb lobster, fries, small salad and a bloody mary or bubbly cocktail. This was plenty and then some for two people! You can opt to upgrade your cocktail to offer more premium spirits like habanero vodka or celery gin, which is really fun! All the food was quite delicious. The burger was so juicy, the lobster steamed nicely and they made it so easy to grab the meat (one of the reasons I sometimes steer away from lobster is cracking the shells, I know I'm lazy). The fries were seasoned nicely and the bloody was delicious! The space is great for groups, watching games, or now takeout! The prices are pretty fare and your tummy will be satisfied!"
361,"I've come here so many times. I often just get the 7 Samurai Lobster Roll. I've tried the grilled lobster. Also have gone with people who've ordered a burger. The food is always good. The fries are DELISH. Since the menu is small, items come out fairly fast. They've been expanding their menu over the fast couple of years. Because of this the prices have increased. Either way it's good and still affordable. The drinks are also good here.I dont recommend the appetizers. Your better off without them. There expensive and not worth it. I've tried two and they have always just bee okay. The food is really enough and filling on it's own. Overall i will continue to come here. The food is always consistent and the waiters are always great. Btw this is my fav location. I've been to others and they have nothing on this one."
362,I was very excited about going to this restaurant. Unfortunately my expectations were not met. The food is very basic at best. I was pleased to know that the lobster was wild caught and the burger was fresh meat. The lobster came with lemon and butter sauce. The lobster did not have any flavor. I had to add hot sauce on it. The burger was also very basic. After eating I noticed one of the chef constantly wiping their nose with their arm. I understand it's the winter and someone's nose may get stuffy but when handling food it's not the best to do that. Overall wouldn't come back sadly
363,"The food was delivered very fast. The food was good but I there were a few issues. For one I ordered the lobster bisque but it came with absolutely no lobster. For 12 bucks I want lobster and not bisque. The flavor is there just not the meat. Also the burger was good. Bread didn't taste fresh and but the rest was great and flavorful. I ordered it medium well and it came medium which isn't a big deal. I also requested for it to have added blue cheese crumbles. I understand if it cost extra but I definitely would have wanted it. All in all I would try again, but definitely not order for delivery."
364,"For starters - the place is beautiful! The music is just at the right volume and the way they social distance is amazing. They really did their thing with precautions here! The staff as well is amazing, the manager made sure to come to our table to greet us, which he doesn't have to do but it was a nice touch. Our waiter was super nice as well, I'm glad we had him! Also, this may not matter to you all but there was a very sweet, cute employee, I did not get his name but I complimented him on his nice eyebrows and I'm pretty sure it made his night, should've left me number haha. People there are just so nice. They make the experience even better. NOW- for the food! TASTY TASTY TASTY!! They really made me want to go back for more - the lobster is yummy and meaty as well, the burger is just perfectly made and tastes so good! The fries are perfectly seasoned, and the salad was just so mouth watering and delicious. But my favorite part of all was that sauce!!!! Oh my god!!! That thing is heavenly! I swear, if they ended up selling them in bottles I would buy them out. It is SO GOOD!!! Dip the lobster in it for sure and if you have more dip everything in it!!!! 5 stars all around literally! Awesome place."
365,"Came here on a semi casual double date and it was a lot of fun. The classic burger and the classic lobster roll were really good. The drinks were also delicious. The staff was very friendly and tried to make the ambience fun which is much needed in these dreaded covid days. Even with the place half empty, you can feel New York City is going to come back. We all had a great time! Would go back again. Covid safety: this place was on top of it with temperature checks and very spaced out seatings. Majority of the restaurant looked empty. Glad we made reservations because it was a long wait other wise. The menus was also touch-less scan and view."
366,"Love this location for its spaciousness. Have come a total of 3xs, including a post-pandemic opening. Lobster is always juicy and fresh. I'm not a garlic lover but I take TUMS and dredge every piece (including my fries) into the garlic butter sauce. It's worth it. Parking is free on Sundays so you can often find a spot on the street and not a long wait to be seated. Give it a try!"
367,"Super cute spot. Came here to start a girls night out. We had reservations so we were seated pretty fast after someone from our party left contact info for covid tracing. Loved the downstairs seating, felt exclusive lol. The drinks were good. Started with the calamari which was great! Im obsessed with the sauce it came with. I ordered an extra for my lobster roll. I was also impressed with the small side salad that came with the meal. Ive seen some questionable side salads. The waiters had so much personality. Felt comfortable asking for recommendations. The place is big so we were comfortably seated away from other tables. Def would see myself coming back to try the other things on the menu and of course the drinks."
368,"Burger and Lobster is a long time fave of my bf and I's. We've visited both the Flatiron and Bryant Park locations in the past for celebrations. Our visit tonight though was a large disappointment. We had a reservation and still had to wait for a table that was squeezed between other tables where the couples beside us were a mere foot away. Our appetizers got to our table within 15 minutes of ordering. The problem came when the main course arrived five minutes after that. We hadn't made a dent in the appetizers and the lobster rolls were still placed in the table. Worse yet, we hadn't even received our drink orders. When we asked the waitress for our drinks she left midway through the sentence to get them which was just rude. The lobster roll still had small shells and the fries were overly salted. Sadly, I don't think we'll be back anytime soon"
369,"The regular popular items such as the burgers and lobster rolls were just medicore for the pricing. I think they looked great but nothing special.However, the truffle lobster omelet was actually really great. The combination of flavors worked together perfectly"
370,"We came on a Saturday night for dinner. Reservations were fairly difficult to get; we were refreshing the reservations page minutes before the reservations for our desired day became available, and in less than a minute almost all the time slots were taken. The tavern part of the restaurant is more laid back with an a la carte menu similar to what you'd see in any American style restaurant in Manhattan. The quality of the ingredients was definitely there, but price-wise I'd say it's a little overpriced for what it is; $40 for a hamburger after tax is pretty steep even for New York. Tables were pretty squished together as well. The entire night we were somewhat forced to listen in to a conversation between two men in the finance industry about their investment strategies...not exactly what we wanted for a weekend dinner. Overall though the service was good and food/drinks were good. Next time I think I'd prefer the tasting menu to get the best perspective of bang-for-buck at gramercy."
371,"If I could give more stars I would. My dining party and I had the best time here and recommend it to anyone. The bread for the table was some of the best- even the butter was delightful. The service was impeccable as well. I dropped my fork and right away they came running with a new one. For drinks, we got the Sichuan slushy and sherry cola. Small for the price but tasty. $18 for each. One of the dishes we ordered was the brick pressed chicken. It was juicy and so good. The portion size was pretty big and would definitely order it again. We also got the tile fish. It seemed like a small portion but it was enough. If you're extremely hungry it's probably not enough but the taste was out of this world. It was fresh and savory. Every bit was eaten and thoroughly enjoyed. The clams that came with it added an extra level of flavor and depth. For dessert, we got the GT Signature cookies. They were huge, moist, and perfect. Soft and chewy with a perfect amount of toppings. The triple chocolate chunk was the best but the blueberry oatmeal was fantastic too. Although pricey, we Would definitely come back!"
372,"My brother recently had a milestone birthday, and he wanted to go out to a really nice restaurant to celebrate. You didn't have to tell my family twice, because we always mark special occasions with restaurant celebrations - and if there's a chance to try someplace new I jump on it. That being said, we were able to snag a reservation for a Sunday lunch and headed on down to Manhattan. I quickly learned that there are two different options to choose when dining at Gramercy Tavern. The first option is the dining room, which has a set price and fixed menu. The other option is the Tavern, where you can order a la carte. We chose the latter, since we preferred ordering off a menu and the dining room can be really pricey (not something we were looking for as a family meal). We were seated outside which was great since it was a beautiful day and the restaurant did an awesome job making their outdoor tables as comfortable and possible. The menu contains mostly New American fare, plus updated takes on more classic dishes. I started with a garden salad, it was pretty good and contained pieces of prosciutto which was a nice touch. It was light and fresh which made it a great starter. I had heard great things about the Tavern Burger, so I decided to get that as my main. The burger was great - really juicy, and topped with a tasty aioli. The burger came with duck fat potato chips which were super crispy and the perfect complement to the burger. Since it was a special occasion, we opted for dessert. We shared the ricotta blintz and the cookie plate with milk. The blintz was good - my grandma loved blintzes so whenever I see them on a menu I always order them. The ricotta was ricotta was just enough and the apricot that came with was a nice complement. The cookies were great - they were thick and warm and perfect for sharing. We got one chocolate chip and one oatmeal raisin and they were some of the best I've had of each. Service was excellent - we were consistently tended to and it really augmented the whole experience. Overall, I had an excellent time at Gramercy Tavern. The food was delicious, the service was a highlight, and I would have no hesitations about returning. This is definitely a great place to go both for a more casual lunch or a special occasion."
373,"WOW SO GOOD! I had the tasting menu with the wine pairing. I'd say only about two of the wines were spot on pairings but I wasn't a fan as it went on. The wine choices got sweeter and sweeter and just wasn't my cup of tea. The food however, was superb! There wasn't a single thing I'd add or omit from any of the dishes. My favorite being the lobster dish. Nothing beats perfectly cooked lobster, nothing! The duck was also the best I've ever had. Just melt in your mouth, juicy, flavorful and the skin was crisp and easy to eat. Mushrooms were sprinkled about the plate and wow were they good. ( I'm never a huge fan of mushrooms ). Very good dish. Nothing but raving reviews for every single dish I ate, down to the complimentary bread and butter. The service was also very good. Our server seemed to be very knowledgeable of the menu and attentive to our needs. My water glass was never empty and the food kept showing up in a timely manner. 5 stars !  ( s/b this is my third time visiting GT but, by far the best experience. I'm so happy to know that some restaurants haven't lost their charm, possibly even improved through the pandemic)."
374,"Decided to check out this place out, finally! Made a reservation during restaurant week. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the dining area had a more casual bar/tavern like section and a more formal dining room at the back. The seafood was good - lobster and artic char. The fish was on the salty side, just a bit, for me.  The dessert was my favourite. The cheesecake was almost like a creme brulee texture with the best tart sorbet and berries. The duck was excellent. So succulent. They have an extensive wine list. But we ended up ordering cocktails and wine by the glass. The Nero d'avola was a new addition to the wine menu. Definitely glad we tried it. The service was excellent. Can't complain. Would return to try the burger."
375,"Where to start! I was inspired to have my first *Michelin starred* dining experience based on previous Instagram posts from my favorite chef/restaurant owners here in Rochester. They love and are inspired by this place? Say less! Whether you care about the value of the Michelin system or not, there is a certain ""we are awesome"" swagger and energy that comes with dining in a restaurant that has something (but also nothing?) to prove. Giving off real Anton Ego* from Ratatouille vibes (LOL), I put my phone away, sat down at my reserved Tavern table by myself, and really soaked in the entire experience.My server was kind, polite, helpful, not in the least bit overbearing, and answered all of my questions. With no fridge in my hotel, I was determined to conquer every delicious bite of this meal and leave leftover-less. I went with a chianti, flatbread appetizer, and steak. The entire menu is a wealth of riches - so choosing was pretty tough. This goes without saying, but everything really was fantastic. Unique flavors, flavorful sauces, and a perfect balance of light veggies to rich meat and tangy punch. Each bite (minus one) was pure perfection.The minus one comes from a piece of green plastic in my steak dish that looked a lot like a piece of parsley, but was in fact plastic. I really thought about not writing this review at all, but I DID want a way to remember the experience in all of its perfect imperfection. The staff was obviously apologetic and amazing about the whole situation, and I finished my steak in it's entirety without apology. I was laughing and smiling about the entire situation for the remainder of my evening in New York, and having this happen made the experience even more unforgettable than it already was. That piece of green plastic was a beautiful reminder that, no matter how high our expectations are and no matter how much pressure of perfection we put on ourselves, shit just happens. In classic Megan-is-the-main-character form, I felt CHOSEN by this plastic!!! How often do you think someone gets plastic in their food at this establishment? My guess is like...never ever?? It was my destiny.If you're looking for a perfect meal and human experience, get yourself to Gramercy Tavern. I look forward to going back with my partner for their full tasting and wine menu someday in the near future. Amazing location in an under-explored-by-me neighborhood. Get yourself there and treat yourself!*Disclaimer: I am in NO WAY comparing this review/my status as a reviewer that of the brilliant and incomparable Anton Ego. He is singular."
376,"This review is for the tavern room not main dining room. Excellent experience from start to finish. Service is top notch. Drinks are excellent- I tried a seasonal cocktail, spicy margarita, non alcoholic sparkling pear drink and tea. My review is 4 stars because I thought the food was very good but not excellent. There wasn't anything wrong with it but it just didn't wow me. We had to start flatbread and seafood sampler. Then to follow cheeseburger and brick chicken. For dessert chocolate pudding cake and the sticky toffee pudding. We also opted for a special lobster with caviar tart- this was my favorite thing we ate. Everything was very good but not wowing. Overall I would return and update my review after trying the tasting menu in the main dining room."
377,"Just like Blair Waldorf, this is my absolute favorite restaurant in New York.Not only is the interior classic New York with tons of florals and greenery, but the entire vibe is so cool and elegant. We came at lunch on a Saturday and sat at the bar since  we didn't have a reservation. I would say we won't make that mistake again next time as the place does fill up, but we had such a wonderful experience at the bar I exclusively want to sit there! The bartenders were friendly and charming and even comped us a round of cocktails. Amazing!We each had two cocktails and split the corn flatbread, shrimp toast, and tavern burger. Every. Item. Was. Exquisite. There was not a single crumb left on our plates. And the kitchen even cut our burger in half for us and delivered them on separate plates. Small gestures like that really show how much a restaurant cares for its patrons.I can't wait to come back and try even more off this menu. 10/10 would recommend!"
378,"The food was a 4-5 star experience; the service, however, was more of a 2 star. But I feel bad giving them less than a four because it wasn't our waitress's fault. They were just extremely understaffed. We sat down at 6:45 pm and we couldn't leave until almost 10pm because of how slow the service was. Meanwhile most of us had early AM obligations. Aside from the extremely slow service with extreme waits between ordering drinks, food, desserts and getting the check, it was an otherwise pleasant experience. The executive chef greeted each table and we always had water.We split some amazing things. #Apps1) shrimp toast - very fresh on a brioche toast. I was expecting it to have more of a crisp to it, but overall it had a very soft texture.2) beef tartare - simple and fresh.#Mains1) cheeseburger - not sure what they use to make the burger, but it had this deliciously greasy taste that was very different from other burgers I've had. 2) chicken - I would get this again next time! I don't know how they make the chicken soooo juicy. 3) fish - the taste and the texture was there! 4) steak - very simple and very good. #Dessert1) peach melba sundae - MUST GET. It tastes like the best of summer in your mouth. I'm hoping to come back for dessert only; just to have my other friends try this sundae 2) cheesecake - hard to really assess given how much I loved the peach melba sundae. It was good but not nearly as good. 3) chocolate pudding - this was complimentary given how slow the service was! We appreciated it. I actually tried this first of the three desserts and thought it tasted amazing. But after having that peach melba sundae, I had another spoonful of the pudding and it also paled in comparison.In summary, you must come and try this peach melba sundae. Seems like it's a seasonal addition. The time is now. And I hope and pray that you have better service."
379,"I finally got to try Gramercy Tavern, even if was only for their lunch menu. But, boy, what a treat it was. I went in with a group of people from work. We ordered everything from the appetizer list. The ones that stood out the most was definitely the Steak Tartare. I believe there was hummus inside as it was served with a pita chip. The only downside was I wish they gave more than 1 chip to scoop out the tartare. Since for some it maybe a bit much to just eat the raw meat alone.Also we had a salad which was very good, but I forgot what it was called. I think there was prosciutto on top and the dressing had a bit of a kick to it.For the main course I got the Tavern Burger, let me just say this was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. The sauce in the burger had a smoky taste which was really good. The chips were good, but at the end of the day they were just chips. The buns and pickles definitely were homemade, which I think is unique about this burger. Some of my coworkers were able to try other entrees such as the steak, chicken and duck meatloaf. I was able to taste a little bit of the duck meatloaf. It was really good, I thought it would have a gamey taste to it, but not at all and I couldn't even tell if I was eating duck.As for desserts we had the Sticky Toffee Pudding, Chocolate Pudding Cake and the Apple Sundae.The Sticky pudding was probably the best dessert, but with that being said the Apple Sundae was also very good. If you had to pick a dessert that you think everyone would enjoy I would say the safest bet is the Apple Sundae. The Apple Sundae has a layer of Apple Sorbet on the bottom which was to die for and you could tell that the sorbet was freshly made in house.Overall great experience accompanied by great food and service!Thank you!!i"
380,Came here for the lunch only burger and it did not disappoint. It's not huge in width but has quite a thick patty with a layer of raw onions at the bottom. Better yet though were the optional items we added. The thick cut bacon was delicious and the fries were huge with just the right level of outside crispiness vs. inside mushiness. Very well seasoned as well. Service is prompt and efficient. Vibe is very old school NYC steakhouse as others have described. I think lunch is the best bang for your buck if you can make it in during the day!
381,"So we had the absolute amazing 3rd time at this steakhouse!  We had the sliced tomatoes, shrimp and bacon for appetizers. Just know that even in the dead of winter, you will get the best tomatoes. The thick cut bacon is unlike any bacon I can describe. It is meaty, charred almost like pork belly. The shrimp was so meaty and sweet with a kicky cocktail sauce.The steak. No words. A little story: my oldest loves steak and he saw a show about this restaurant when he was younger. So we agreed when he 13, if he made honor roll all quarters we would go. Well, we loved it but his 13 year old steak taste and his younger brother of 9 thought it was ""just okay""....so they were not excited to return at the ages of 17 and 13.....it blew their minds! It was so good!!The sundae was also good, I did not try but it was slurped up!"
382,"I have been wanting to try Peter Luger for years, but Brooklyn just seemed so far away when I was working in Midtown for my client. Lol On this, my husband and my first trip/vacation of 2022, we decided on NYC and with that convinced him that we should finally try Peter Luger. He used to work in Wall Street and he'd been to Spark's, and he LOVES steak, so this was going to be a good test. First off, it's so easy to get to the Brooklyn location. All we did was take the J train from Downtown to the Marcy station in Brooklyn. From there it was a 5-minute walk to the restaurant. We got there about 39 minutes early for our 4:15pm inside reservation. We waited maybe a minute to check in and about 2 minutes before we were seated. The hosts were nice and welcoming. Our server was Ricky, a really nice, sweet, and accommodating gentleman. As it was our first time, we had some questions and he was happy to answer them. We decided on trying one extra thick cut bacon and shared a Caesar Salad for our appetizers. Ricky even split the salad for us without us asking. Nice touch. The bacon was so tasty, my husband said he could eat that all day long. I could too! I LOVE bacon!  We enjoyed these with the great basket of fresh bread that is served with butter (complimentary). There were 3 types of bread and all were great!It only took a few minutes for our steak for two to arrive in an extra hot sizzling plate. It was huge plate and with sizzling butter that they placed at an angle so you could spoon it all over your steak. If you're sharing with someone that likes their steak more done than you, they recommend putting the piece of steak on the sides of the platter so that it cooks the steak more. Luckily for my husband and I, we both like our steaks medium rare. The steak was perfect and soooo tender and tasty. We have to say that it's the best at steak we've ever had. My husband said it was so much better than Spark's. We also ordered a side of German Fried Potatoes for 2. It was also delicious. If we had other folks with us, it would have been nice to try the other sides. We saved room for dessert, so we ordered an apple strudel to share and Ricky happily split it for us and added the vanilla ice cream a la mode and brought a filled bowl of fresh whipped cream. That was so delicious too!  We saw lots of folks order the sundae for their kids who happily ate it all up. Our total bill (excluding tip) was $220 that included the Caesar salad, one piece of bacon, steak for 2, 2 seltzer waters, a glass of rosé, and the apple strudel a la mode. Well worth it!  Ricky's service was awesome!  I would ask to be seated in his area again, if we have a choice. We definitely plan on coming back. Thanks Peter Luger for an amazing experience."
383,"After almost a year since the last time i had this experience i could say i am disappointed!We gather here last night when my cousin came all the way from Virginia to visit and i decide to bring my friends too here. The food is not as well done as we ordered or expected, the blood was all over the steak and it was not dry or tasty at all!! We celebrated my friend's birthday as well and the staff were so kind about it;) Better work more on the kitchen staff though!!"

I was a fan of the creamed spinach and thick slice of bacon. Don't forget to pair it with some of their house sauce! I look forward to coming back here to try the Luger Burger next time I'm in town. Enjoy your eats here!"
385,"I had a great experience at Peter Luger. It was my first time as I am from Miami, FL so I was just visiting for the weekend. This dinner was made as per my fathers request. I love the old school Brooklyn vibes Thai restaurant gives off upon entry- I really enjoy places like that. The food and service matched the vibe of the restaurant. The food was not refined and fancy but it was whatever the opposite of that it lol. The steak was absolutely delicious as well as the sides and cocktails. I paired my dinner with a dirty olive martini and *chefs kiss* . I can't wait to come back again. I'll be dreaming of the salad, shrimp cocktail and steak until then!!"
386,"Our waiter was Felipe and he was a very nice and friendly waiter! He made small talk with us and even gave us some touristy suggestions to go sight see. We appreciated his service!They call it rib steak, which is also prime rib. We ordered it medium rare, which our pink plastic piggy says medium rare on the back. It was already sliced in a few pieces for us to start. He placed two pieces on each of our plates to start and poured extra fat on top. If we split a steak, it was an extra $5 service charge per menu. We also ordered two red glasses of Shiraz wine to go with. I like dry wine with my steaks.The prime rib was very tender, flavorful and savory. It was cooked perfectly! Classic good steak. Nothing to not like!When Felipe gave us the check, he also gave us Peter Luger gold coins! What a fun, small surprise!Pros:-amazing, great service - shout out to Felipe! -good steaks and huge too! -plenty of reservation times on Resy -complimentary house bread -offers outdoor dining Cons:-does not accept credit cards. Only accepts debit cards, checks or the Peter Luger card. Can use debit card on Apply Pay but need PIN number -$5 service charge for sharing a steak Tip:-15min grace period"
387,"Peter Luger is a staple in NYC - came here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. We took the only reservation slot at 4pm which shows you how well they're doing!Once seated, we were given a bread basket - cold like some other reviews mentioned but we weren't there for bread. We ended up ordering the steak for two, onion rings, German potatoes, a slice of their thick cut bacon. Honestly, their bacon was the highlight for us - we've had their version from the supermarket and it cannot compare! The one at the restaurant is 100x better! Their steak is cooked to perfection - medium rare like we asked. Our server was such a cool guy - he recommended sides to complement our meal better, a red wine he liked, and made sure we ate all the meat on the bone (it really is the best part). Cleaned our table between meals which I appreciated because I spilled their sauce on the table (sorry!)Peter Luger is a steakhouse - no frills. If you want upscale and bougie, you're not going to get that here. If you want good quality steak and being taken care of by a family member, that's what Peter Luger feels like. Can't wait to come again!"
388,"A review from a tourist. My family booked reservations here based on some family friend recommendations. We were staying in Time Square so it was a bit of a hike Ubering from Time Square to Brooklyn. We arrived a little early but the staff members were still able to get our table ready early for our party of 12. We hung out at the bar for 10 minutes getting drinks while they prepare our table.We were treated with such great service. Our food and drinks came out fairly quick. I don't eat meat but everyone else did enjoy the steak. I ordered salmon and it was delicious even though I couldn't finish such a big salmon on my own. We ordered other side dishes, appetizers and desserts. Everything was served well and tasted delicious. We certainly enjoyed our experience. The kids really loved the chocolate gold coins at the end."
389,Its all about the steaks here. Medium Rare Porterhouse steak is divine here. Crunchy crusty edge pieces with a nice cool pink center. It was a definitely a steak orgasm moment. The side dishes were underwhelming. Was expecting better considering the $15+ price.Getting a reservation wasn't too bad and they do require proof of vaccination before you sit down.A good experience overall. The steak was excellent.
390,"I've been here twice and loved it both times. The steak is exceptional. I always get mine medium rare and it's the perfect amount of flavor and not overly fatty. The creamed spinach and thick cut bacon are also a must get. It's a super popular spot so make sure to make reservations in advance. They are also cash only, which is a bit annoying since the bill can come out to $100 per person if you include sides and drinks."
391,"What an experience! Definitely a special occasion type of place! We traveled back in time considering the old fashion decor and the age of this place. They know what they're doing. The steak was perfectly cooked, spinach was delicious. The staff treated us like gold. See you again soon"
392,"I had modest expectations going in based on my dismal experience with old-school steakhouses such as Bookbinders in Philadelphia, but my wife said this was the only Christmas present she wanted, so here we are.We arrived over an hour early, but the reception desk said that was no problem and told us we could wait at the bar. In the meantime I ordered an Aperol Spritz and was stunned by how perfectly blended it was. Ten minutes later we were seated in one of the upstairs dining rooms, which was very nice; much roomier than the rather crowded downstairs area. Here's what we ordered:Wedge salad: easily big enough for 2-3 people, this is a must-have dish! The interplay of the high-quality bleu cheese and ultra-thick smoked bacon is divine, and makes the Flemings version of this dish seem like it came from a high-school cafeteria.Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail: I've only seen jumbo shrimp this large one other time in my life. If you love shrimp as I do, this is a must have. The shrimp is incredibly fresh and clean tasting, completely unlike the mass-market farmed variety. And the cocktail sauce has a wonderful, vinegary kick to it, making this easily the best I've ever had.Steak for 2: This is a very large Porterhouse steak: one side is a Filet Mignon and the other a top loin (New York Strip), which is perfect for us since filet is my favorite and NY strip is hers. We compromised on getting it cooked Medium Rare and that worked out perfectly for this cut (see accompanying picture). The inside of my filet was cool and the outside seasoned and charred to perfection. Now I understand all the excitement about dry-aged beef. Tender, tasty, totally amazing. For the price this is truly an amazing amount of superbly prepared meat.French Fries for 1: Bravo: These came to our table too hot to eat! After cooling for a minute or two they became delectably crisp outside with a creamy center inside. Delectable and well worth the $7.95 price.Apple Strudel: Really superb and stands up to the best Germany, Vienna and Switzerland have to offer. Lots of caramelization on the bottom coupled with a deep-flavored filling really takes it to the next level. And the copious bowl of schlag takes it out of this world. Another must-have!Bottom line: This is a must if you enjoy quality steak and don't mind trading an almost silly amount of money for a commensurately special experience."
393,"CASH, DEBIT, or CHECK is the only form of payment they will take here! Don't say I didn't tell you so. The steak, the STEAK is the true star here. Don't get a single serving, do yourself a favor and just treat yourself to the steak for two. The cuts get better the more people that can help you eat it haha. But seriously it's so gooooooood. Perfectly cooked and so flavorful. Man, i miss this steak already! Also, their burgers are AMAZING. One of my favorite burgers! The house bread, house sauce were so good, that we asked for seconds. Yup. We did. As for side dishes we ordered fried onion rings and spinach. Yum yummy YUMMMMY! The French fries were just as good!! The staff is friendly and they make sure your well taken of!"
394,"Make your reservations in advance! This place has 1 michelin star so be sure to know in i advance if you want to try it, which you do need to try. Interior was simple, Bar felt iconic. There was also outdoor seating with some heat lamps. Came here as a group and ordered a bunch to share. Cobb salad, creamed spinach, grilled broccoli, french fries, onion rings, and steaks for three x2 share. It was a bit too much food if everyone only eats 3-4 pieces. If the group can eat more, then go for it. We didn't have room for dessert. The steak 5/5 - STAR OF THE SHOW. Honestly don't even need too much sides, the steak with their sauce is bomb. The steak was good both warm or even when it got to room temperature while we were sitting there. Perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, quality of meat was amazing too.Wedge Salad 3/5 - Little too heavy on the cheese, it came with their signature bacon which was amazingly delicious. Expected more lettuce.Creamed Spinach 4/5 - Not a huge fan of this but the whole table enjoyed it. It's not your usual taste of creamed spinach, it feels more like a very puréed spinach. Grilled Broccoli 3.5/5 - Not really worth the price. Flavor is good, but the portion is just not worth it.Onion Rings 3.5/5 - Not that amazing but the group enjoyed it. The batter was a bit underwhelming but the size of it was good. French fries 4/5 - So crispy and right amount of thickness in my opinion. super crispy and yummy. Bread Basket 3/5 - Most of the bread wasn't warm which is probably the style and it was almost too much bread. Felt sad had to waste it Service 5/5 - all the waiters were super helpful and friendly. Helped changed plates and forks. Served the steaks too and explained the cuts of it."
395,"I came here for dinner on a Friday night with a group of 3 people. I haven't been here in years so wanted to see how it is now. Maybe it's less crowded because of COVID-19? It was totally wishful thinking on my part. It was still crowded. We ordered the bacon, tomatoes and onions, steak for 3, creamed spinach, German fried potatoes, and of course the Holy Cow sundae. The steak was really good but pretty overpriced. I would skip the bacon, tomatoes and onions, and sides. The bacon wasn't anything special. The Holy Cow sundae was good and super decadent. Service was great, our waiter was funny and very attentive. I would probably only come back for a special occasion since it's a bit too pricey. I think there's better and cheaper steakhouses in Manhattan like Sparks or Keens."
396,"Worth the hype! For 2 of us, we got the porterhouse (medium rare) for 2, fries for 2, sautéed brocoli and bacon and could not finish it all. Everything was delicious and the atmosphere is a true old school steak house. Will be returning!"
397,"Great steaks at a classic and historic NY steakhouse. You can't go wrong here. I've been to Wolfgang's as well and have a slight preference for Peter Luger's.We started at the bar while waiting for our table and our bartender was fantastic. He recommended some great drinks and also gave superb recommendations on how and what to order at the steakhouse. He made great conversation with us. Strong drinks. We ordered the thick cut bacon, the bacon wedge salad, the lamb, and the dry aged steaks. For sides, we ordered the German fried potatoes and creamed spinach. The thick cut bacon is to die for. I'm serious, if you eat pork, then you must dry the thick cut bacon here. They're big, so one order can feed 2, but by all means I could've had one all to myself. Similarly, the bacon wedges in the iceberg lettuce salad paired very nicely- the crispness of  the lettuce balanced out the greasiness of the bacon. As for the steaks themselves, classic New York dry aged steaks. If you've never had dry aged steaks before, these are a new experience. If you have, these are standard and well executed steaks. Both the lamb chops and the steaks were great (don't overlook the lamb chops!). We did end up ordering an extra rib steak late into our meal, which came out a little bit underdone but that's a bit on us for ordering late and rushing it. We did notice one thing - do not order the sliced tomato and onion. For $20, it's literally just a sliced raw tomato and sliced raw onion... go to the supermarket nearby to get them for $2. All in all, a fantastic experience. Waiters were knowledgeable and friendly. It was slightly loud, but not unmanageable. The atmosphere of the restaurant is less modern/corporate (there's actually bright lighting), and more 20th century family restaurant."
398,"Peter Lugers, the legendary,  iconic, no frills steakhouse in NYC and it did not disappoint. We arrived early accidentally because I thought the reservation was an hour earlier but they sat us anyways.Alan the manager was wonderful. We started with the lemon drop martini and the spicy margarita- delicious! Appetizers: iceberg salad was delicious with homemade dressing. Their famous chopped bacon on top. We also ordered their famous bacon  and thought since we had 3 people, let's order 2 slices - we thought wrong (see pic) ONLY ORDER A SINGLE SLICE OF BACON unless you have huge bacon lovers of course. We ordered the steak for 2 and the lamb chops. The steak came out sizzling and was aged and cooked to perfection THE LAMB CHOPS ^^^ that's it. Period. Point. Blank. I've eaten A LOT of meats (lol) and especially lamb in my life and this was hands down the best Lamb chop I've ever had in my life. Anytime I ever come here again I am only ordering the lamb because it seriously made me fall off my chair. The lamb chops alone are worth a Michelin star. Sides: the crispy onion rings are a MUST! They pair so beautifully with the steak and lamb and the best part about their onion rings is that the next day you can pop them in the air fryer and they will be even better the second time (trust me)  If you don't leave this place stuffed with clogged arteries, you're doing it wrong."
399,Actually I would've given a 5 star rating but our waiter was very underwhelming. We were seated probably 10 minutes with no acknowledgement from our server at all. He knew we were there and never even offered a menu ? We finally got to order the Porterhouse for 2 medium rare with the German fried potatoes or as our server said they are nothing more than home fries !We also had the onion rings and dessert was apple strudel with their complimentary bowl of whipped cream. I think of the entire meal the dessert was best. We've lived in NYC all our lives and never went there so on our 9th Wedding Anniversary we finally got there. It's checked off our places to eat list but sadly we won't go back
400,"Peter Luger is one of those bucket list restaurants for many looking for great steak. The meat here definitely did not disappoint. The décor is very old school New York and it appears they never, nor do they need to, updated the restaurant. The ambiance really helps to focus on what you're really there for anyways, the steak. Service was prompt and felt very New York with their demeanor. The staff knows their steaks are great and they're very good about serving the food to you when it's delivered. Thick Cut Bacon - This was an amazing cut of bacon. Cooked perfectly and came out hot. It had a great cook to it and deep pork flavor. I only wish all bacon tasted this good. Thanks Peter Luger... you just ruined all other cuts of bacon for me. Steak for 2 - The steak for 2 was large enough that I was able to share this with a family of 4. Everyone had a very reasonable share of the steak and still had a bit of work trying to get it all down. Not that I'm complaining, the steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. They know what they're doing here. The plate was hot enough to where if you really wanted to cook your piece a little more, all you had to do was just throw it back onto the plate to sear it a bit. The meat was well aged, giving it every bite a deeper meaty flavor. This is the way cow should taste. A symphony of beef in your mouth causing all sorts of joygasms. This is what everyone needs to experience when it comes to steak.Creamed Spinach - I can see why this spinach is popular. It actually tastes like spinach. It was definitely not overly drenched with cream or overly seasoned with salt or spices. It's nice to get a lot of that excellent spinach flavor and leaves the seasoning part open ended for those that like to adjust for themselves.German Fried Potatoes - Simplistic in nature, but well worth the order. A great pairing of coarsely chopped potatoes that are fried up. Almost like hashbrowns, but definitely isn't. Probably not right that I call them that because they're much better. A great carb pairing to the meat and veggies you have for the meal. I enjoyed my dining experience here. The service and food were good. Some of the best steak and bacon I've ever had. The only sour note that just didn't mesh well for me was the basket of bread. It was a nice spread of different types of breads including one that had chopped bits of garlic in it. However, it came out fairly cold and a bit stale for some of them. They were still tasty though. Butter was pre-packed individual portions. Other than that, everything else was incredible."
401,"Before eating here, I'd never eaten a piece of beef. Excuse me, before eating here I FELT AS IF I'd never eaten a piece of beef a day in my life. I am ruined. Eating steak from anywhere else will not do. All other cuts of beef were complete @#!% compared to this experience. In checking off another life goal bucket list item,  I had the fortunate opportunity to have dinner + drinks with a high school friend at where we enjoyed the (best) wedge salad (I've ever had), porterhouse steak for 2, onion rings and the famed apple strudel with schlag. (sweetened whipped cream which is perfect in coffee). I enjoyed every second of our time together with our shared steak and the food was just window dressing. But I'd come back here in a New York minute.The small yet adequate dinner menu has the famed bacon as an appetizer and the tomato and onion salad that comes with the steak sauce. But if you get the wedge salad, not only does bacon come on top, you get the privilege of the freshness of the tomatoes and the freaking amazing blue cheese dressing. I've always liked blue cheese but now I crave it because of this meal.One note of caution: don't eat the bread from the bread basket. It's cold, not very good and you're better off saving those calories (and room in your tum) for the rest of the meal."
402,"Let's be honest, steak shouldn't be categorized as fine-dining since it was just cheap eats for the blue collar after a day of hard work at some basement bar, and well-done steak is what people used to have. But why ordering well-done steak will be seen as bumpkin in today? Cause it really takes time and SKILLS, let me repeat, SKILLS, to make well done steak as tender and juicy as those rare, medium rare whatsoever. Step in with high expectations since a good ol' steakhouse like PL should know how to cook steak well. Well, nop, ordered medium-well since I don't wanna risk that much, still get got. The steak is, how should I say? Rubberized? Chewy? Well I don't mind the texture that much, but most important, it lacks the steak aroma, you know, the first thing comes to you before the first bite. Sadly, it doesn't have any the ""steak smell"", just regular beef aroma and taste, just like any other New York style steakhouse, their steak lacks the char-n-steak mixing aroma. There's one moment I thought my steak was cooked with canola oil.Not everything is bad, the bacon is the best I ever had (probably due to I haven't have bacon for too long), with some of their steak sauce and horseradish, really goes well with their bread. Still, as a famous steakhouse, their steak is so blend really make me disappointed. Not sure if there's gonna be further visit. If so, it's probably for the bacon and bread."
403,"Celebrated my birthday here. I won't say this is the best steak I've ever eaten, cause it's not, but overall good experience. I just wish the tables are not so close to each other."
404,"I went into Peter Luger with high expectations from what I've heard about the restaurant and it's reputation but tbh it's just meh.Don't get me wrong, the steak is pretty good - tender, juicy, and good flavoring. The fried potatoes were a bit too burnt for me and the creamed spinach was pretty bland. The bacon was very good but it's like bacon which is always good lol. The complimentary bread was cold and hard. Maybe I should have read more yelp reviews before going here but I just didn't since I was strongly convinced this place was amazing, so amazing that I didn't feel the need to read reviews before coming but I was wrong. The cash only policy wasn't too apparent at the restaurant and if you don't bring cash or your debit card you're stuck. We literally tried a bunch of atms with our credit cards but couldn't get any cash. And they gave us a hard time before offering up alternative solutions. But like what kind of restaurant serving expensive food doesn't take credit card?? It kinda seems ridiculous honestly and definitely would deter us from coming back in the future. Also the waiters rushed us so much during the meal - table turnover is prioritized over customer experience. The service is not the best here either, curt and rushed. Overall, very average experience and is not anything special."
405,Have I dreamed of Peter Luger after seeing it on somebody feed Phil? YesWill I dream about bathing in their steak sauce whilst being fed slices of bacon by cherubs? Also yes It was everything I dreamt it would be And don't leave without trying the lamb chops.... Possibly the best cut of meat on the menu
406,"Our party of 6 was seated promptly. The host explained new health regulations thoroughly making us feel at ease. The waiter suggested to bring food for the kids as soon as possible, which was an excellent idea to avoid any melt downs.  The servers switched stations and we hardly noticed. Both servers were extremely pleasant. Food did not dissapoint, as expected. Steak was cooked as requested. Salads were excellent for sharing. Deserts were also delicious, but after having the steak, we shared a pecan pie, and a huge Sunday. And having coffee with the home made whipped cream was an excellent suggestion! Our family will def try to make it back soon."
407,After covid interrupted my Oct 2020 visit and December 2020 visit I returned 1 Oct 2021While many of the familiar faces are missing the best dry aged porterhouse in the world remains. As does the bacon and the schlag. While I'm not a NY Times reporting seeking fame by giving zero stars I am an honest person that call a winner a winner. Perfect every time and beyond compare. Best in class.
408,"Way better than expected! I had some concerns about going here after reading other reviews. I'm pleased to report that it's worth the hype! We had a reservation for lunch, and we were immediately seated once we arrived. While I wouldn't say our server was friendly, he got the job done and was attentive. We had the bacon, lamb, and steak. They were all fantastic and cooked to perfection. Typing this review is making me hungry. A surprising and welcomed twist were the out-of-this-world desserts. Treat yourself and get dessert too. I promise, you won't be disappointed."
409,"One of the best steaks I've had! My friends and I split the Steak for 3, potatoes, and creamed spinach. The sides were fine, but the steak was phenomenal! Perfectly cooked, juicy on the inside, and a bit crispy on the outside. I would not change a thing about it.The Corpse Revivor #2 cocktail is a great choice if you enjoy gin. It's a strong drink but tastes very refreshing since it has notes of citrus, and is a good contrast to the heaviness of the steak. I would definitely come here again! I would advise bringing a jacket here though, since it does tend to get chilly inside."
410,"Every single thing was delicious, the service was great, and the ambiance was good.  I was going to give them 4 stars,  because nothing was super unique,  but decided on 5 stars because the steak was cooked so perfectly... better than you can get anywhere else.We started with the salads and bacon... the wedge was refreshing and so good! We ended up dipping the bread in the wedge sand dressing :) The bacon alone is worth going back for. When the steak came out, it was just cooked to perfection.  It had a great crispy seat on it, and the inside was exactly medium rare! The bone was especially good with extra crisp. All of the sides were good, but nothing to jump on the table and scream about.  Overall, a deliciously FILLING meal!"
411,"The attitude of the servers is quintessentially New York...they are sassy and kind of slow but they know their food is good and your impatience means nothing to them. The food is divine, don't get me wrong. But the price and the HYPE are just a lot. There are great steaks around the corner for a fraction of the price and no white table cloths. I would recommend coming with your grandparents/parents/ a boomer friend but skip if you're in the city for a few days and thought about coming."
412,"I'm glad that I got to try Peter Luger during my lifetime. Like what others have mentioned, reservations ahead of time are a good idea and they do not take credit card-- only cash, debit card, or checks.We made a reservation ahead of time for a Friday lunch. When we arrived the place wasn't terribly packed, but it gradually filled up during our meal. The server tried to push us to order alcohol.The two of us split the creamed spinach for two ($12.95) and the steak for 2 ($123.90). They brought over a small variety of rolls which were cold but still tasted good. The creamed spinach and steak was a lot of food for two people. There was a huge boat of steak sauce that I wasn't a big fan of (the steak didn't need it-- it was seasoned nicely on its own). I liked how the creamed spinach wasn't heavy on the cream. I could actually taste the spinach in it.We asked for our steak medium-rare and unfortunately the steak was overcooked (it was closer to medium, and some pieces were medium-well). The steak was still delicious but we felt that it would have been even better medium-rare!"
413,"I've never known what true love was until I stepped foot in this restaurant. If you're an avid steak lover, then Peter Luger has to be on your bucket list of steakhouses to dine in sometime throughout your life. Though I rarely make the trek out to NYC, this was the number 1 place for me to visit. Like most restaurants, they do have an option for reservations online. You'll certainly want to take advantage of this unless you're willing to brave the very long wait times. You'll need to put a card down to secure the reservation so that they know you're serious, but you have until 3:15pm on the day of your reservation to change or cancel for free. This restaurant is located in Williamsburg and is easily walkable from the Marcy Avenue subway stop (you can literally see the sign from the stop telling you where to go.)We chose indoor dining expecting there to be air conditioning since it's been a humid week out here but there wasn't any on. Not sure if it's usually like this or if it was because it was going to rain later that day so they decided not to turn it on, but if this is a big thing for you I'd recommend calling. We ordered the steak for 2, onion rings, French fries for 1, and creamed spinach for 2. They don't list the onion rings as being a shareable plate as it's just one portion but man was it a lot to share. The steak itself was better than I could have ever imagined. I mean, how can any other steakhouse compete with a steak that's still sizzling on the plate? And please don't disrespect your steak and get well done. We ordered ours medium which ended up perfect because we had some on the medium well side and others on the medium rare side. We loved everything we ordered except the creamed spinach. I've been told service here can be hit or miss. On this particular occasion we had excellent service and had no complaints. I'd take much better photos in any other circumstance but seeing as how I could not waste another second before taking a bite of this delectable food, I'm sure you can gather that this place is truly well worth the visit if a dedicated Yelper wastes no time in digging in!(47/100--2021)"
414,"Peter Lugers is iconic it's not much you can say about  and icon going strong. From the first step through the famous doors to the last step out, impressive service impeccable food.  Like that old saying it's it's not broken no need to fix it.  PL might not have all those fancy. Sides like other steak houses but  you go there for the steak not the sides.  We ordered  a porterhouse steak, creamy spinach and a burger.  Soft succulent flavorful steak  with a splash of Luger sauce and it's a match made in heaven. The burger was wonderful juicy  cooked to perfection. Def a go to spot."
415,"First off walking in, it screams old style american and reminds me of my grandmas dinning room, so the food must be great right? We sat down and was served some bread (which to be honest was a little sad that it wasn't warm or at least a tiny bit), but put that aside since I need the room for my food aka the steak! We ordered a ceasar salad for starters (keep it traditional right?), which was very very good and pretty traditional. Then proceeded with ordering some of the german home fries, 1 order of the thick cut bacon and the steak for 2, a nice porter house steak.Home fries were very good and would be great at any time of day. The steak came in on a sizzling hot plate cooked just right with pink in the middle, evenly cooked around and a nice ""crust"". The bacon was spot on as well and worked well with the salad and a nice flavor change in between bites. Service was fast for me and very nice. Price was a little high but worth it and definitely a place you should go to once and if you live closer at least once or more a year."
416,"A quintessential steak house complete with old New Yorker charm. Don't expect them to roll out the red carpet for you but what they lack in bedside manner they make up for with genuine charm and passion for their trade. Come for the steak, get the shrimp cocktail, try the slab bacon, don't order your steak well done...(you could but you may hear people groan) this is a steak house. They have lamb, they have chicken, they have a fish dish but it's primarily a steak house. The wedge salad comes with an entire slab of bacon chopped up to make it sound healthier for you. Which it is, but don't expect anything fancy! Lettuce, bacon, dressing, a tomato or two and you're golden. Cash or debit only. Or if you're fancy like me you'll have a Peter Lugers charge card. The only credit they accept. No visa, no Amex, no discover, no diners club. Menu must triesT-bone (porter house)Fried potatoesFrench friesCreamed spinachLamb chops. The rib steak (often overlooked this steak is amazing for those who want a fattier steak)Apps to get (in order of must get to optional) Slab baconOnion and tomato slathered on Peter Luger sauce Wedge saladShrimp cocktailDessertsCheese cake Apple strudelBoth served with schlagAll desserts are good. Schlag their version of whipped cream is made in house. Desserts are outsourced (from a reputable source) but don't let that sway you from the apple strudel which is heated up in house."
417,"One of the most iconic NYC experiences, and a historic cornerstone of its culinary scene, on par with Katz's or Zabar's. Dining here feels like one of those things you just have to do at least once in your life, just to say you've checked it off the bucket list. All that being said, though, it's an experience that's more about the hype and nostalgia than it is about the real quality itself.There are two musts on the menu: the steak and the bacon. Both of these are the clear highlights of the menu. We split the steak for two three ways, which was plenty. Both of these were great, and serve as the tent-poles that elevate an otherwise wholly mediocre restaurant. I also tried the burger, which I'd heard a lot of hype about ... it was above average, but far from one of the best of most memorable I've had.The bread is plainly okay, something that tastes like it's been brought over and reheated from Olive Garden, and the sides are average and unimpressive. Feel free to get any of these if you need to have something green on your plate, but you could dispense with any of these add-ons and not miss out on anything.In all ... I'm glad I checked out Peter Luger, because I think I'd have always been curious about it and wondered if I was missing out on an NYC highlight. In reality, though, it's probably like Times Square or the Statue of Liberty: one of the most recognized things about the city, but way, way down the list of things that are actually great about it. It's puzzling to me that this has a Michelin star when so many other incredible places don't. It's not even among the best 'meat-enthusiast' experiences in the city: the Au Cheval burger is better, the St. Anselm steak is as good for a fraction of the cost, and so many KTown KBBQ spots give you a ton more variety AND quality for the same price tag. Do all those things first, then check this out if you must."
418,"One of my favorite steakhouses in NYC since forever! Must get their thick sliced bacon, onion rings and their steak of course. The steak comes on a hot plate in case you need the meat to be cooked more. Their sides are superb especially their creamed spinach and don't forget to leave room for dessert!! We saw a table of 6 people ordered 3 cheesecakes so we got it as well and that was the perfect ending to our meal!"
419,"This is for their Brooklyn location. I said won't return after the last time at their Great Neck location but a family member is visiting New York and this one is on the wish list. We were assigned to a terrible location, by the door. The servers are nice.Breads: great but the packed butter (commodity Butter?) feels cheapHouse red: Merlot, Pinot Noir and Cab: all are pretty goodCaesar salad: good especially when we were all thirstyCream spinach: the greenest I've had - really goodGerman potato: good. The two t-bone steaks for four is ok: had it better elsewhereWe didn't have room for coffee nor dessert. Not sure what the average dinner consumes but when we ordered ONE Caesar salad and steak-for-four, for the five of us, the elderly serving staff looked a little puzzled. Really, it was just a dinner, after a 10-mile hike in the city. And the amount of food was just fine."
420,"This was a classic steakhouse and the main highlight being the food, however the service was very lackluster and made me feel negative towards the end. We ordered the huge juicy piece of bacon, some sides, a salad and shared a ribeye steak for one. Everything was delicious and came out fast. It was fun seeing the meat cook while it was sitting infront of it on the plate and we could pick or choose which pieces we wanted to eat first and the steak itself was delicious. However, the experience was greatly dulled towards the second half of dinner. We tried to track down our waiter or in fact anyone for more water and it took a staggering long amount of time  to get someone's attention to just refill the water. When we were finished with dinner and it came time to pay our checks, it took over 25 minutes (Yes I kept track) to finally have our waiter come back and ask how we were doing. During the waiting time I was able to flag down another gentleman who worked at the restaurant who has been checking on other tables and refilling waters and when I asked him if he could get our waiter and bring our checks, he became visibly upset and said he was not the waiter and told us to wait. He gave me a visible glare and I felt very uncomfortable. The food was great and our waiter was nice, however the service time was very long and the other gentleman who was working outside that night was not very professional at all."
421,"Bad service first off. Asked two times to clean up table, even helped by putting the mess on the edge of the table.Cream of spinach, more like spinach smoothie, where's the cream. Yes it's been here for 130 years but the sides are okay, onion rings are good. Cold bread at least put it in the oven. If your a steak eater come here. It's just for the name"
422,I wish I could say something better about my time at Peter Lugers but it was a lackluster experience this time around. I went to Peter Lugers years ago and had a great time. But there was something missing this time. Really unmemorable experience for a special occasion. Service was decent. Will not be back. Bacon was crispy. I was so excited when the steak came out sizzling. But the steak was tasteless and lacked flavor. I actually had to drown my steak in steak sauce which is something I hate doing. I couldn't even taste the steak at that point. It was tender beef though. This place is just a tourist trap living off their old reputation.
423,"After biking @ Central Park & walking the Brooklyn Bridge in the middle of the day, we were rewarded by yet another amazing meal at the MOA steakhouse.Its our 3rd visit so the objectives are clear: steak, bacon, apple strudel & schlag. Mission accomplished! The glass of house cab was forgetable, based on experience you are better off sharing a new bottle of the PL cab.  Bread looked good but I gave it a wide birth. Caesar salad was good, blah blah...Steak for 2 was amazing and still the best aged American steak I ever had, sorry Ruth's Chris.  Porterhouse cut was cooked to perfect medium rare & sizzling, just the right amount of salt & butter. I was told the steak sauce was good but who needs it.  Thick cut bacon was fatty, juicy, salty, charred & smoky.  Apple strudel was warm & flaky while not overly sweet. Schlag was super airy & sublime just like previous visits.  Afterwards we pass out yet again from another food coma."
424,"Ok tourists! Listen up! This place is popular for a reason. First time in NY and we asked about a steak place and this place came up a couple times. The steak was smothered in butter and perfectly cooked . The onion rings and the wedge salad were also really good. Can't go wrong. 1. You have to be a carnivore to eat here. It's a steak house. I get it. I'm not a steak person and I got the wedge salad that was fantastic! They loaded it with blue cheese crumbles and the dressing was really good. They give you their ""extra thick cut of bacon"" on top that was really good. I also ordered the onion rings that have a crispy batter. They are shareable as it's a massive plate of rings. The server was surprised I didn't order the steak which is understandable and reconfirmed it two more times. Lol 2. The only problem is that they nickel and dime you for everything! 1. Bring cash as they don't take credit cards. There are fees they have to pay if a credit card is used.  Smart for saving money but really inconvenient to the customer. So I let it pass: 2. In the small fine print at the bottom of the menu there is a note that there is a $5 surcharge if you share a meal. The single serving is shareable but I don't care for steak so I let that pass. 3. They have a burger on the menu but not available after 4pm. It's a $26 burger with cheese and fries versus  a $60 single steak. Less options means more money from the customer. I get it. 4. Finally,, I ordered a iced tea that came in a 12 ounce glass. With ice you get about 8 ounces. I asked for a refill and he said that will be another $4. I used to work in the restaurant industry. If I'm paying $130 with tax and tip for 1 steak, one salad, one onion ring and one iced tea, I seriously think you can give free tea refills and soda refills and you don't need to surcharge $5 if in case people want to share and not feel the need to over stuff themselves with the extra large portions available. The menu doesn't say what kind of steak or how many ounces. It's labeled as a single steak, steak for 2, steak for 3, etc etc. if you plan to come here, you and your party better be carnivores or you won't enjoy your meal as much as the meat eaters. No matter how good a restaurant is, when you nickel and dime everything, I make it a point to not go back."
425,Me and my husband are big steak house fans and made reservations far in advance after hearing all the awesome reviews from Yelp and YouTube.. we cameHere on a Friday afternoon and we didn't have to wait too long to be seated the service was not good at all.. we had water and bread served to our tablePromptly but no one even said hello to us or even introduced themselves as our server like we were seeing at other tables.. we were basically just asked questions of what we wanted and before we could even ask another question the waiter had walked away. my favorite thing we tried was the salad with bacon in my opinion it had way more flavor than the bland steak that was served. The creamed spinach resembled baby food and didn't have too much flavor either. We ordered the steak house burger and asked it be medium rare however when biting into it it tasted more like a tar tar and was still mooing..which would have been fine if that's what we ordered however it was not..  the bland food coupled with the bad service are two reasons I won't be back to this establishment
426,"Steak and lamb were good, but the bread was cold and the ambiance could use some improvement. Too bright and too tight in spacing. You feel like you are eating dinner with people across from you at a different table. Also, it was a little off-putting when the waiter used his fingers to pick crumbs off the table and wipe sauce off.Don't forget to bring cash."
427,"Eight of us came here to celebrate a family wedding. We ordered their signature steaks and lamb chops with creamed spinach, mixed green salads, German potatoes, French fries land three desserts. The medium rare  steak was tender and beautifully grilled. They were cooked to perfection.  My only gripe was that the meat itself did not have the  natural flavor that is inherent in good aged beef. Our server, Alex, was wonderful!"
428,"My dad and I visit NYC quite often and we've tried multiple steakhouses but we have never found one that makes us want to re visit next time we are in town. Peter Luger's is a ""must-go"" on our list of restaurants to visit now. The steak is full of flavor and it comes out so hot and fresh. I will say their side options are slacking and definitely have room for improvement. Our steakhouses back home have options such as lobster Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, creamy corn and a few other things. It might just be a personal preference but if I could have this steak with better sides I would never eat at a different steakhouse in NYC. Don't get me wrong, the food is still incredible and the service was fast. We made reservations so I'm not sure if you can walk in and get a table. My dad and I will definitely be back!"
429,"Fun Fact: Peter Luger was named the  ""Godfather of steakhouses"", and  ranked No. 1 best steakhouse in New York City for the 27 consecutive years with Zagat.  Peter Luger was also awarded 1 Michelin Star for 4 consecutive years since 2008. -Dress code: casual to dressy. I saw everything from jeans and sneakers and tees, to dresses and sports coats. Dress for your occasion, and look fairly put together and you'll be fine! USDA Prime (only 2% of cattle) is the standard here, and you can taste it as soon as the sizzling plate hits your table. While admittedly service was slow for my liking, and the bread on the table was more of a filler rather than anything special - the start of the show shined extremely bright. The steak was phenomenal. The crust was a light but perfect crisp, it was cooked to our liking, and it was served angled on another plate with a spoon so you can continue to spoon the juices on your steak. Every part of the dry-aged steak was equally tender, tasty, and juicy. It truly is one of those, so good you have to close your eyes moments. The menu makes it easy to order.. you order by the person and an appropriate porterhouse comes out, so hot its sizzling (steak for 2, 3, or 4) . They also have great sides  - I highly highly recommend the cream of spinach (rich but light at the same time) as well as the German potatoes (think super crispy and thick has browns). Both excellent. I devoured everything, it was so good! For dessert, as full as I was - the pecan pie was calling my name. My goodness, I must have had a second stomach because I ate everything! It came with a side of whipped cream to dip and WOW was that a big side , and wow did everything go together. Highly recommend a stop here!"
430,"A REALLY good gluten free doughnut is one of those things that has been kind of impossible to find. They're usually just a good baked item but not a proper doughnut. These doughnut plant Marcona almond gluten free doughnuts are PURE perfection! You wouldn't know they were gluten free, they're so perfect!!! I literally have to set limits for myself for how often I can go buy them, otherwise I'd be eating them multiple times a week! According to my family who can eat gluten, apparently all the other flavors are to die for as well! And great coffee to top it all off."
431,"With many non traditional flavors, fresh fruit tangy jam fillings & big doughnuts, this place seems to be quite popular, especially for glaze lovers! 5*Easy to pick and order your doughnuts by looking at their display case of the 15 doughnuts currently available. 5*Listed in order by columns from top to bottom.   Personal favorites are noted by *Box #1Vanilla Bean & Blackberry Jam (filled) $4.45Coconut Cream (filled) $4.45Fresh Blueberry Sourdoughnut (vegan) $4.25Crème Brûlée (filled) $4Raspberry (cake) $3.75Vanilla Bean (yeast) $4Valrhona Chocolate  (yeast) $4*Peanut Butter & Blackberry Jam (filled) $4.45*Box #2Coconut Lime (cake) $3.75 Coconut Lime Sourdoughnut (vegan) $4.25Marcona Almond (gluten-free) $3.95*Brooklyn Blackout (cake) $3.85*Très Léchés (cake) $3.95Carrot (cake) $3.95Cacio e Pepe Sourdoughnut (savory) $5.50All good but personally enjoy yeast doughnuts the best and seem more like what I think of a doughnut is.

432,"Our doughnut adventures continue... This place had so many reviews on yelp and google that we decided we couldn't avoid checking it out. Their ""Sourdoughnuts"" stood out to me and are definitely different. The star was a Cacio e Pepe savory doughnut that was on sourdough. It was a little weird for the morning but very good. The guy behind the counter was sure to point out to us that this donut was not sweet.We got there early but there was no wait at all. The decor inside is super cool and I'm glad we decided to make the walk down opposed to ordering online.Personally, I preferred the cake doughnuts over the sourdough or filled square ones. The peach and tres leche doughnuts tasted best.There are plenty of places to try but if you find yourself in the Lower East Side, definitely check this place out!"
433,"I wanted to try the creme brûlée, but they were sold out. In fact, they were sold out of just about anything I wanted at 2 pm on Saturday. We ended up trying the marcona almond donut. It was gluten free, which always makes me suspicious. It was great despite that. I would definitely come back and get the same thing. Or try the creme brûlée."
434,"This place is amazing. It is almost as if you could think up a donut and they would have it. The donuts are so creative. Let's be honest, when it comes to donut places it's either they're not good, they're ok, or they're exceptional. Well this is one of the exceptional ones. Definitely worth your consideration, and gets my recommendation."
435,"Doughnut Plant always hits the spot a they never disappoint. These doughnuts may be small in stature but they pack one helluva punch, and the pumpkin doughnut will surely leave you out for the count. The pumpkin doughnut has just the right of amount of spice and sweetness. The doughnut is dense but crisp. Saying it's tasty is an understatement. Doughnut Plant is relatively pricey, charging $3.95 for the pumpkin doughnut but if you have extra cash to spare it's well worth it. Staff wore masks. There's a reasonable amount of public outdoor seating. The shop is located in the Lower East Side (aka LES), across the street from Target and Trader Joe's. So, if you're in the mood for a sweet treat after shopping stop by Doughnut Plant and enjoy a doughnut."
436,"I've been dying to try this spot because I've heard so many great things about it. Def did not disappoint!!! Honestly one of the best doughnut places I've ever been to.Vanilla bean glazed, pistachio cake, carrot cheese cake, chocolate cake and strawberry cake.... each and every single one was soo delicious. Perfect in both the texture department and the flavor department: the cake ones were extremely moist and the yeast one was fresh and chewy. Special shout out to the carrot cheese cake with the cream cheese frosting. It was SO good and reminiscent of a cheesecake..such a unique flavor for a donut too. The strawberry cake tasted like real strawberries, rather than an artificial strawberry flavor. The vanilla yeast had a perfect glaze that covered the entirety of the donut and crackled beautifully when bit into."
437,Coffee is disgusting.  Overpriced over sweetened donuts.  I do like how you can sit outside and the setupOf the shop just not for me - poor quality of food.
438,"Anyone who knows me knows that I am a huge strawberry fan. This strawberry cake doughnut was so moist and filled with strawberry flavor (that wasn't artificial or too sugary) and was the perfect strawberry cake texture. It did feel a bit strange that my doughnut essentially tasted like and had the texture of cake rather than a doughnut -- but if that's what you're looking for, then this is wonderful!! Apparently the difference is due to them making the doughnut out of more cake-like ingredients rather than yeast."
439,Another reliable local spot. Their hours are weird and you need to get their early to get the good stuff but the doughnuts are delicious. They have some really pretty doughnuts and interesting flavors. It's a fun spot to check out if you're showing friends or family around Brooklyn. I just wish they had better hours!
440,"$4.00 for ONE simple glazed donut!???.Not only was it about 4 times what any other donut place would charge, it wasn't even good!! Kind of thick, dry and heavy.......definitely NOT light, fluffy and delicious, which is what I was expecting. Total rip-off. Never again!"
441,"I have come here time and time again! My favorite employees are Chrissy and Ashley for good reasons! They were very friendly, courteous and extremely empathetic! It would be nice to see them getting a raise or at least a promotion. I would always highly recommend the ""Wild Blueberry"" even if you don't like blueberries I would still recommend this! Doughnut Plant will always be my favorite doughnut place! Krispy Kreme watch out!"
442,Big selection of familiar and eclectic fried treats. I usually grab a couple and try them over a couple days as they are huge.
443,"Stopped in yesterday to pick up a doughnut. I had reserved it online earlier that morning since it was a Saturday and I figured they might be sold out of what I wanted. I got the black and white donut. It was half yellow cake donut and half chocolate cake donut, all glazed, and dipped in half chocolate icing and half white chocolate icing. Hmm it was good! If you like black and white cookies, this is worth a try!"
444,"Just as delicious, as fresh, as scrumptious, and as mouth-watering as always. You'd think that they'd slip up one time and serve you some stale doughnuts, like others do/have (no shade). But not once have I been disappointed when visiting a Doughnut Plant. The staff was pleasant and helpful. Overall, it was just a great experience. The guy in front of me ordered about 20 doughnuts, so I'd guess that he's also a fan! Lol! Thanks, Doughnut Plant!"
445,"Still hitting them the 5-piece, one year later. Brought my lady and my cousin and his lady here as well, and they loved it. Even during the pandemic, this place is doing it right. Their peanut butter end jelly doughnut is so so so freaking good. I could eat dozens of these. Go here and buy them."
446,Delish!! A little pricey but definitely worth it. I also got a iced vanilla latte and it was so good!!
447,"My girlfriends and i stopped in for some doughnuts and iced coffee. It was such an adorable cute & funky place. We all ordered different doughnuts so we could share. I had the vanilla bean, one had blueberry, other had carrot cake and 4th one had chocolate something. We all loved all except for the carrot cake flavor, it was way too sweet. Otherwise, adorable place!"
448,"Saw this place on the Food Network so I figured I'd try it while in NYC. Very disappointing. I got the pb&j donut and my husband had the vanilla bean. Both were very dry and forgettable. Not worth the cost. Not sure how a professional chef rated this as ""best thing I ever ate""."
449,"Good iced coffee, sweet and refreshing. Donuts are a bit dry but not too sweet and fluffy. Glaze flakes off a bit easily but not bad. Seating inside. Nice staff. Note their hours, they close early at 4pm. Also closed Monday and Tuesday. Sold out of tres leches donuts, but will hopefully try it someday."
450,The best breakfast I had in New York! The Spanish scramble was delicious and banana/walnut pancakes were soooo good. The pancakes were fluffy with walnuts and banana in the pancakes with the tasty syrup they provide. We sat in the bar so our waitress was busy with making drinks and helping customers with their food at the bar. Very attentive to all the customers at the barThey told us the wait was going to be over 2 hours but we only had to wait 1 hour so not too bad. It just depends if reservations or people don't show up on the lists
451,Came here for Friday brunch and waited around an hour to get seatedPros:- Good food at good prices - favorites are the banana walnut pancakes and chicken n waffles- Friendly staff but you do need to flag them down since they're so busyCons:- The food is good but not that great to justify the long wait time- Single stall coed bathroom - really long lines
452,"We didn't order the pancakes, which is their most famous menu item, so I can't say my review is completely holistic, but the breakfast items we ordered were solid. To me, it wasn't anything super special, but the meal was cooked really well. If you like American breakfast, this might be a good place to visit. However, make sure to consider the wait. We waited around 45 minutes to an hour when we came on a Monday around 11am. We didn't mind since we were visiting from out of town, so we walked around the area while waiting. Everything on my plate was cooked well and had good flavor. It's all your standard breakfast items -- bacon, biscuit, eggs with cheese, and potato. We paid $40 with tip for both our dishes, which is pretty standard for brunch."
453,"My husband and I were in and out in 27 minutes! Loved the quick service! Reservations are recommended. We came at opening on a Monday, we had a reservation for 9am, and there was already a line formed outside. Luckily, because we did have a reservation, we were seated immediately. Service was attentive and we quickly put in an order for fresh squeezed Orange juice, a latte, and chocolate chunk pancakes to split. Our food came out in a reasonable time. The chocolate chunk pancakes were good and had random chunks of chocolate hidden inside each pancake, but the majority of chocolate was on top of the stack. The maple butter was great- not too sweet. Overall, a nice place for breakfast, but I'm not sure it justifies a 9 am reservation or a line on a Monday morning. I'd come back if it were ever not busy, but I won't wait in line for it. That said- they do have a nice takeout window next door that offers pastries and coffee to-go!"
454,"This review is just for the blueberry pancakes! I walked in around 10:00 am Sunday w/o reservation and was told it'd be a 30 min wait, I expected worse tbh.Sat at the bar, just got the pancakes, they came out fast, and I was definitely underwhelmed but they were good. I almost wish they were at least edging a little sickly sweet like a lot of overhyped sweets so I could feel something, I kinda like Ihop's better! Especially for the price point (about $18 with tax/tip), but it's NY. I am still satisfied just to say I've tried so in the end...target audience is for those who maybe weren't interested in this restaurant but were curious about the famous pancakes. You can pass."
455,"Come here for the pancakes!My friend who's a local recommended this spot and it did not disappoint. We made reservations right at opening time on a weekday morning right at 9am and there was already a line forming by 8:45am!My brother and I split the Latke Eggs Benedict and the seasonal Blueberry Yuzu Pancakes. The crispiness of the Latke Eggs Benedict were cooked to a perfect crisp, and I really enjoyed the trout roe caviar. The pancakes' portion was huge and the berry/citrus flavor mix was excellent.For drinks, we had a Mexican latte and a Passion fruit bellini. What's better than starting your day with a bit of booze and caffeine? Service was quick. Would return!"
456,"If it's your first time coming here, definitely recommend getting the Blueberry Pancakes cause they were phenomenal!  Me and my friend went at 11am on a Tuesday and though there was no physical line, we still had to be put on a wait list with an expected wait time of 45 mins. Luckily we got an open table 30 mins of aimless but fun strolling later. Let's talk pancakes. Honestly I never thought too highly of them since it's something I could easily make at home with some cheap pancake mix but the minute I dug in, damn pancakes can be this good??I love how fluffy the pancakes were but moist when dipped into the sweet syrup on the side. There's also so many blueberries inside and on top which gives the pancakes a more refreshing bite. Also the syrup on the side is just the perfect amount of sweetness compared to the store bought maple syrup which can make pancakes feel so much heavier with every bite. Although I couldn't finish it all since 3 pancakes is a lot and it's actually bigger than it looks compared to picture, I didn't feel disgustingly full! The Yuzu part is a special flavor for their February pancake month and luckily we came on National pancake day to try it out before it's gone. The Yuzu was an interesting pair which works if you're into sour things. The Yuzu curd on top only has a hint of sourness  while the Yuzu syrup that was glazed on the plate was SUPERRR SOUR! Dipping the pancakes into the sweet syrup and Yuzu syrup was fun party for the taste buds - kind of like eating sour patch kids.Service was amazing! Although the server checked in and asked us if we needed anything a few more times than necessary, he was very friendly and professional. FYI, they accept cards now and the restroom is to the right of the entrance once you step into the store."
457,"Let me start by saying that while Clinton Street Baking Co does take walk-ins, its highly limited (especially on the weekends). I've been meaning to try out this place for years! But prior to covid, I was never in the mood to wait for the lucrative brunch spot (nor was I ever prone to making brunch plans by way of reservations weeks in advanced). Knowing this, coupled with a friend who sent me a a kind reminder/ nudge to finally go, I woke up extra early on a Sunday and made my way to the general area. Placed my name down at 11am (quoted a 2.5 hr wait- woof). No big deal, I had a few errands to run in Soho and wasn't particularly hangry. Walked around, shopped around a bit and returned promptly at ~2hr mark and was seated shortly. Now on to the food! Its national pancake month and baking company is in their name! So obviously we had to order pancakes. As a table of 2 we shared a savory country breakfast (3 eggs, mapled ham, has browns, cheddar biscuit), blueberry pancakes, side of greens and maple bacon. Everything came out fresh and hot. The pancakes were super fluffy and the buttered maple syrup was just perfection (and I'm not usually a sweets person!).  4.5 stars for me as it would be hard for me to return with the wait times etc. They turn away walk ins around 12 (my experience on a Sunday/ and reading reviews). So while waiting for our table at the 1pm time, I overheard a few disgruntled potential patrons who responded a bit unkindly to staff saying this was the 3rd / 4th time they've driven far away from like Connecticut or upstate only to be turned down for walk ins. To these folks I say: if this is your third time, you should know to come earlier to get your name on the walk in wait list (which does close up early). I mean logically if they close at 4pm, a waitlist of about 30 parties is all they can really support, so come early! If you don't make it on the list, don't fret. There are lots of other brunch places nearby!This is a smaller, cozier restaurant and wait staff are super nice. Food comes out fresh and you'll never feel rushed to leave (no matter what the circumstance). All in all, solid place for breakfast/ brunch!"
458,"February is Pancake Month, and let me tell ya...I really tried my best to get as many of these specialty flavors as I could. If you only come here once, make sure it's in February. These specialty pancakes are not joking around. My personal favorite is the fresh coconut pancakes but that doesn't mean the other two were less than stellar. I have a little over a week to try to get in there for a flavor or two!"
459,"I rarely get sweets for breakfas but the hype is real for the pancakes! Especially the blueberry ones. Pancakes were so fluffy and the blueberry added the perfect amount of tartness. Also got a salad that I was pleasantly surprised with. Bigger portion size than I expected and tons of flavor with the vinaigrette. We also got the candied bacon which was okay, I forgot to ask for them to be extra crispy so I bet they would have been even better. If you love pancakes, don't skip on this place!"
460,"Let me start by saving that after trying almost everything on the menu (besides the pork), I enjoyed every dish. On top of that, the drinks and service were on point! My favorite dishes were the spicy shrimp & cheese grits and the pancakes without the fruit topping (but doused in the warm maple butter lol). For cocktails, I loved the Blood Orange Habanero Margarita but the Hot Buttered Rum was on heavy rotation at my table. Folks had at least 2 rounds of it. After many years of not making an effort to visit, I'm glad that I finally dined here and see why it's a LES legend."
461,"Came at 8:45AM to avoid the long lines and we weren't even first in line! At 9AM, they promptly opened and started seating people, starting with those that had a reservation (didn't even know you could make reservations).We got the pancakes (blueberry) and chicken & waffles. Both were really good and quite a decent price, but the highlight was their maple butter syrup- so thick, rich and amazing maple flavor. Pancakes were really nice with a slightly crispy exterior and soft fluffy insides. Only downside is that after I had eaten ~1/2 of the plate, the pancakes left a weird feeling in my mouth, like there was a layer of something like powder maybe over my teeth and tongue - not sure why (maybe too much baking powder??)Chicken and waffles were great, with a juicy piece of chicken on top of nice crisp waffles. Pretty solid breakfast spot overall, but not sure if I'd wait 1+ hours to eat here."
462,"Finally, get to try Clinton St!! Been dying to try this brunch spot and finally got res though Resy on a Sunday Brunch. Highly recommend making reservations or you'll be waiting for a while ha. If you love pancakes, Clinton Street will blow your mind. I also enjoyed their buttermilk biscuit too yumm!What I ordered:- Buttermilk Biscuit Sandwich: scrambled eggs, melted cheddar, house made tomato jam, with hash browns- Country Breakfastthree eggs any style, Heritage maple cured ham, hash browns, buttermilk biscuit- Clinton St. Omelette:  (choose two fillings) spinach & bacon, served with hash browns & sourdough toast- Pancakes with Warm Maple Butter with wild maine blueberry (MUST GET!!!)"
463,"This is my favorite breakfast place when I visit New York and I love introducing people to this spot. It is well known and definitely a place that gets busy. I think you can get seated quickly if you come at the right time, but it does get busy very quickly. I highly recommend their blueberry pancakes and their maple butter is amazing. You can get their pancakes with blueberries, banana walnut or chocolate chunk, but I personally prefer the blueberries. You get a warm, fluffy stack with just the right amount of acidity from the blueberries and sweetness from the brown butter syrup. It is such a unique syrup but made perfectly.We also ordered the spanish scramble and french toast (banana pecan); all the dishes were amazing and this is such a great breakfast spot to try. After reading some newer reviews, it seems like they take reservations which I highly recommend making!"
464,"We made reservations to come right at opening time (9am on a Wednesday). When we got there, there was a line of people waiting to come in for breakfast, but we were let to the front because we had reservations so I would recommend anyone interested to make some reservations in advance. However, when we sat down, by like 5-10 minutes, the line was gone so they let people in pretty quickly. There were dividers between each table, which made us feel very comfortable in the restaurant.We ordered the blueberry pancakes and the chicken and waffles. The blueberry pancakes were AMAZING. One of the fluffiest and airy pancakes we've ever had and PACKED with flavor. It was the right amount of sweetness, and you didn't really feel gross after finishing it. Each order comes with 3 fat pancakes - I would definitely recommend sharing if you are able. The chicken and waffles do not get as raving of a review as the pancakes. The chicken was dry and didn't stand well the waffle. The outer coating wasn't really crunchy nor crispy. It was more like a sad, half-stale crunch, which wasn't really enjoyable. The thicker parts of the chicken was slightly dry but can be saved by a little bit of syrup, but the thinner parts were near unsalvageable. I also feel like the seasoning of the chicken wasn't super great, and it really relied on other enjoyable parts of the meal (e.g., syrup + waffle) to carry it through. The waffle itself was soft; I wouldn't say this was necessarily a bad thing but if you're looking for more crunch, I wouldn't recommend this. However, the star of the show was really the syrup, which was available for both the pancakes and the chicken + waffles. They might as well put crack in it because that's how addicting it is. It was like maple syrup but on steroids, and we couldn't get enough of it.Because there were both impressive and disappointing components, giving a review is difficult. In our experience, we definitely recommend getting the pancakes (and go hard on that syrup), and maybe pass up on the chicken and waffles. Overall, 4/5 stars."
465,"Hands down THE BEST PANCAKES I have ever eaten. I don't remember the name of the guy making the pancakes but I can tell you, he made it with love! We winged NYC once again and had no reservation so we had a long wait, 2 hrs  to be exact. There is a coffee shop just across the street that made it an easy wait and we walked the city for a bit. Nothing extra special to say about the other food here. Everything else we had was just ordinary. But those pancakes. I will fly out just to get those pancakes again they were so good."
466,"Fluffy, fluffy pancakes with warm maple syrup and butter. I'm not a pancake person but I adore the pancakes here. My sister got the BELT sandwich and really enjoyed that. She said it was very filling. They don't skim on the booze for their cocktails. My sister and I shared the boozy milkshake. I would suggest making a reservation, every-time I've been here there's been a line out the door and having reservations great."
467,"Clinton Street Baking Company is such a solid brunch spot. The food is so good, but be sure to plan accordingly - either make a reservation or put your name down early! As we were in the area, we put our name down on a Sunday at around 11:30am and got a text promptly 2 hours later. Be sure to stick around the area because you only get 10 minutes to rush back to the restaurant!When we got seated, we ordered the Mexican Coffee Shake, Latke Eggs Benedict and Blueberry Pancakes. The shake honestly tasted like chocolate ice cream but it was so good -- not too heavy and the perfect accompaniment to our meal. Everyone always raves about the pancakes and it's safe to say that they are just as fluffy as people say. The blueberries are delicious and dunking your pancakes in the warm maple butter is *chef's kiss.* We ordered the latke pancakes to balance out the sweet things we ordered, but honestly it was the highlight of the meal. The warmth of the jammy egg yolk, the fresh salmon, and crunchy potato latke made for the best mix of textures in every bite. Highly, highly recommend it - would love potato pancakes on every Eggs Benedict from now on!Would definitely come back again!"
468,"I came here for my birthday breakfast after hearing so much about this place. My mom and I were able to get seated pretty quickly as I knew to arrive early because of how crowded it gets.  The hostess and service was kind and there was also sanitary precautions for COVID. We ordered the Pancakes, Brioche French Toast and the Bacon. To be honest the food wasn't anything special. It came out quick , hot and tasted good but after all the hype this place gets I was a bit disappointed. I would say that if you are in the area and looking for breakfast definitely try it but I wouldn't go out of my way again as I think there are better breakfast places elsewhere."
469,"The blueberry maple pancakes are really really good. We tried the chocolate pancakes, and even if good, they were a bit drier if compared to the blueberry ones. The French toast was okay, the caramel on top was a little burned, but it wasn't inedible. Would order again more blueberry pancakes than the rest.The staff was really nice!"
470,"Getting a spot here is hard but so worth it!!The wait is about 1-1.5 hours. I recommend stopping by early and putting your name on the spot. The place is very crowded and there are always people outside waiting. You can get reservations if you reserve early enough. The interior is diner like and there are table, booth, and also bar top seating. The servers here are also extremely nice and sweet. The menu may look like classic brunch foods but I guarantee you that it goes above and beyond. Came here with a group of friends and we all left with a food coma and wanting to come back again. We got the following items:Chicken and Waffles:The portion sized were unbelievable. The chicken is perfectly crispy and so juicy and flavorful. Brought me back to the south. When you bite into it, it both has a crunch and melting in your mouth.Raspberry apple Waffles:The waffles have this natural sweetness to them. The raspberries and fresh. The raspberry syrup/jam that it comes with tastes exactly like raspberry in liquid form and very fresh. Everything balances out with the crispiness of the wafflesSpanish Eggs Florentine:The eggs are perfectly made with a generous portion of cheese one top. The omlette has tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, and scallions, The side of potatoes that it comes with is also spectacular. Blueberry Jam pancakes:The fluffy pancakes with crispy edges did not disappoint. The blueberry topping has the perfect balance of sweetness of blueberries, but a hint of tart that makes it possible to eat the entire thing. Eggs Benedict:The star of the show!! The benedict comes with an english muffin and a hash brown. The egg is perfectly cooked to runny right when you cut."
471,"such yummy hot coffee & delicious French fries!!Pancakes were fluffy, & better thn average .. went for pancake month & tried their MAPLE BOURBON PECAN PANCAKES !! Very sweet & such a treat.. (got everything on the side) Their French fries were made just how I requested thm.. crunchy like chips.. DELICIOUS My waiter & the staff was so friendly, attentive & sweet!A great atmosphere.Took a while to get seated but I walked around the area until it was time!! Portions are generous & reflect the price, & quality!!Can't wait to go back & try othr food & order more fries !!"
472,"So glad that we finally got in! Have heard such great things so have been wanting to try for a while but hear there is always a huge wait. We ended up going on NYE and while there was a 2 hour wait for a party of 2, we just went to a few places in the neighborhood until they texted us (Pause Cafe is right across the street and a great place to grab a coffee and wait). We ended up getting sat the bar which was perfect (although a little cold with the door opening). I ordered a bellini and my husband ordered a mimosa (both were GREAT and the perfect amount champagne - I was a little worried it might be light on the champs and heavier on the juice but it was definitely vice versa!).To eat we split the lox Benedict on a latke and the lox scramble. Both were awesome and surprisingly super filling, even just with half the lox Benedict I was starting to feel full - so there portions are definitely generous. All the staff were super nice and accommodating, particularly as some not-so-friendly patrons were getting quite upset with them about the wait - they handled it very professionally and we ended up laughing about it after. Would definitely want to come back - probably with reservations next time!"
473,"Honestly, I don't understand the great reviews. I had been once before and at the time thought: this food is not memorable and nothing special. My friend hadn't been and wanted to try it after reading so many good reviews, so I decided it had been a few years and maybe things had improved. I was wrong.We got to the restaurant a little after opening and every table was already full. We put our name down on the wait list and were told it would be about an hour wait. When we were finally seated, it took forever for the waitress to come around and take our order and I started to wonder if there was only one person taking orders. My friend and I both ordered a Benedict and a drip coffee, and after several minutes had passed, we hadn't received our coffees. I tried to flag someone down to ask for the coffees, but of course, everyone was too busy or didn't pay attention to me. Finally, I caught someone's attention and asked about the coffee. The coffee was so bitter and awful, it wasn't even drinkable (so a waste of $5 each).We got our food and while the plates both looked pretty, they just seemed a little lacking. My friend ordered the latke Benedict, but the latke wasn't even warm, so it didn't seem like it was made fresh. I ordered the California Benedict, which sounded good on paper, but because the tomato, avocado and sauce were all slippery, it didn't hold together very well and seemed to be missing something texturally since it was on a biscuit instead of a English muffin. Since I've now been twice and have been incredibly underwhelmed both times, I would say don't waste your time waiting in line, spend your money at a place you'll get better food and service, and skip this mediocre restaurant."
474,"Such awesome brunch food on the LES! They do brunch till 4PM all days of the week! I came here for a Friendsgiving brunch with my bestie today and I'm so glad we did. This was my first time coming here. We were seated right away without a reservation. To drink, I had to mimosa. It was awesome and had a perfect OJ to mimosa ratio. My friend had the blueberry seasonal bellini and he loved it. Only negative was that the drinks took really long to come, but other than that they were perfect.To eat, we both got the chicken and waffles and OMG were they incredible! The maple butter sauce was utter perfection. Truly one of the best chicken and waffles I've ever had! It was the perfect mix of salty and sweet. We also got the fried green tomatoes to share. They were amazing as well! The sauce was great and gave them a nice kick.I can't wait to come back here! Next time, I am definitely trying the smoked salmon eggs benedict!"
475,Congratulations you have found the best pancakes in NYC... and possibly the world! I get the choc chunk pancakes which are MINDBLOWING. The 3 pancakes are sizable but not too big they are stacked and topped with melty chocolate chunks. The syrup is brown sugar maple and... I could drink it. It's soooo good.My friend had a savory breakfast which was an omelette with lox and chive cream cheese inside. She said it was incredible! Service was also VERY good. My water was never empty (and I drink a lot of it) and I was consistently checked on. PRO TIP: They take reservations! Make them at least a month in advanced. When I came in at 11 on a Saturday they were not taking walkins.
476,"I have come here multiple times. Food is always good in my opinion. It's always busy here. No such thing as a slow day so do keep that in mind. With that being said, today I walked in at 9:06am (restaurant opens at 9:00am) There were 8 separate tables around the restaurant that were clearly unoccupied and no one ahead of need. Several tables of 2,4 seats, etc.The girl at front had the audacity to say ""it will be a 45 minute to an hour wait, i can put you on the wait list""The couple behind us overheard and said ""45 minute wait??""I couldn't help but get automatically defensive but yet soft spoken and mention ""didn't you use just open 6 minutes ago & there are clearly tables available ""All of a sudden, another girl shows up and says ,""it's ok, go ahead and seat them.""After we were seated, all 8 tables filled up within seconds after with no problem, meaning NO ONE had a 45 minute wait. Someone make it make sense please."
477,"Not sure I understand the appeal of this place. I came here for breakfast with 2 friends and arrived at 8:55am (5 minutes before they opened). There was already a huge line wrapping around the corner of the street. We got in with no issues since the restaurant was just opening but by the time we left around 10:30am I overheard that the wait was over 2 hours. I ordered the Southern Breakfast (2 eggs any style, sugar cured bacon, cheese grits, fried green tomatoes) and a side of hash browns. It was very average.. the bacon was the best part of the meal but everything else was nothing special and I felt like I could have gotten better at a regular diner. Good experience to try once, as long as you make a reservation or get there before they open. But I would 100% not come during peak brunch hours and wait 2 hours for this."
478,"Everything you hear about this place is true. Definitely worth the hype, I swear. The blueberry pancakes are a must. The milkshake was also amazing; I had almond milk instead of regular milk, they also offer oat milk. Everything was a-1. I have no complaints about the food nor the Service. I'll be back for sure."
479,"Reviewing for: Brunch for two! Location: It's a walk away from any subway but the walk is worth it. tFood/Drinks: I live in Seattle now and I still rave about these pancakes whenever I can (it's on my highly recommend list of places to go when I send folks recs). This time around we had the vegan sandwich, an order of blueberry pancakes and the scramble (comes with hashbrowns) we also had the mimosa of the day and a gin and soda. The person I came with still talks about the sandwich and I dream about the crispy edges of the pancakes. Space: The space works with what they've got. They have clear panels up to protect tables from one another. Most of the seating seems for 2-4 people. Bathroom is single stall so don't hold it too long or you'll be SOL with the line.  Tips and Tricks and Covid Deets: We went around 11:30 on a week day and the wait was maybe 20 minutes. Word to the wise, when you sign up for the list don't wander too far (our ETA was 45 minutes) because you have 10 min to show back up. They checked our vax cards and had sanitizer available. Overall:I'll continue to visit every time i'm in NYC and you can bet blueberries will be on the receipt."
480,"I heard about Clinton Street Baking Co for a long time and I always wanted to try it out. Pre-covid, I wasn't able to get a table here. I came here for a Sunday brunch in Nov 2021. I arrived around 11:30 am and was able to get the last two seats at the bar. It was a lovely experience. I ordered the famous blueberry pancakes with maple butter and California benedicts. They were both very very yummy. I love how fluffy, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside of these pancakes. They are perfectly made. I have never had pancakes with this texture elsewhere. They are your 5-star pancakes. I would get other flavors too, just make sure you get the maple butter. I feel like they can make a drink out of it because it was REALLY GOOD. While waiting for my food, I was delighted by the young lady behind the bar, Jesikah, who also serviced us the food. She was very organized, meticulous, and efficient with the orders. I really enjoyed watching her taking the orders because I know every customer's order was well taken care of. She has this great vibe and it brightened the whole place. I thanked her for the bright light she shares. I would love to go back for another serving :)"
481,"Based on how difficult it is to get a reservation here, I was expecting much better food. Overall, it was pretty good, but I mostly felt like it was basic brunch quality.The blueberry pancakes were good, but none of us felt like it was a must-order dish. My BELT sandwich was solid, but again, nothing special. And the omelet someone ordered was below average. I think the best thing we had was the grits."
482,"Each time I come back to NY, there is always a new dining experience.  Nestled in the lower east side of Manhattan this breakfast place hit the spot for me and the kids. We were seated right away and didn't have a wait --tho' it was a Wed mid-morning when we went. I had the banana walnut pancakes w a side of bacon.Kids had Huevoes Rancho w chorizo and the Farmer's breakfast. Both had OJ and I had the bottomless cup of coffee.  The banana walnut pancakes had sticky sweet syrup and fresh bananas. I could only eat half!  My son said the side of roasted tomatoes on his plate tasted like tomatoes you would use for marinara sauce. Very yummy!"
483,"NYC has some of the best restaurants in the world for any occasion and breakfast is certainly no different. The entrance to this place feels like you're walking into a phone booth to get in which I thought was pretty unique. I loved the inside seating too, as it looks out onto the city streets, perfect for people watching. We were seated after putting our names down and waiting for about an hour but it was well worth it. I ordered the buttermilk biscuit with scrambled eggs, tomato jam, and hash browns which were crispy and flavorful.While I enjoyed the unique flavor of the tomato jam and the biscuit itself was delicious, the real star of the show was the blueberry pancakes. The pancakes were light and fluffy, the blueberry topping fresh and sweet, but the maple butter on the side made me see God. In short, get the pancakes. Any pancakes. They even have special flavors out every month. You can't go wrong with anything here, just make sure you try the maple butter, it's on another level good. Also, try the pancakes with maple butter, again."
484,"I'm usually the type of person who prefers waffles over pancakes but I can never pass up pancakes from here! I really enjoy the extra creamy and crunchy textures that the banana slices and walnuts add to the already super fluffy golden brown pancakes. They also offer pancakes with blueberries or classic chocolate chunks. This place is famous for their pancakes and for good reason, though the rest of their menu sounds amazing too! It's almost never *not* crowded so definitely make sure to secure a reservation!"
485,"Been wanting to try this place forever, and finally got my chance, after running an errand in the area. Even on a weekday, it's packed, I don't think it's never not packed. Do yourself a favor and make a resy ahead of time, or else you'll wait an hour + for a table.Came solo this time and wanted to try a few different things, but decided to go with the blueberry pancakes first, as that was on the top of my list, and it did not disappoint! Crispy edges, fluffy and blueberry topping was not overly sweet with a hint of tartness, and only had to sparingly use the warm maple butter, as that was enough for me. I never finished a stack of pancakes before, as it is usually shared with the table, but since this was the main dish, I devoured it completely and it def hit the spot. Will come back to try other items on the menu!"
486,"How do you celebrate turning 33 on a Tuesday? Obviously a trip to the Clinton Street Baking Co.!I've been hearing about this place for years, but have never attempted going because I'm always in the city on weekends and know how packed it is. To be honest, I hate waiting in lines for a table, so it just wasn't a priority. Finally made a city trip during the week, and quickly made a reservation for this spot! And.... let me tell you , it lived up to the hype! SO DANG GOOD! Between the 4 of us we got 4 dishes and shared, because we really wanted to try a bunch of the dishes! Drumroll please.....We got these dishes, and here's the breakdown:1. Brioche French Toast w/caramelized bananas, roasted pecans and warm maple butter2. Wild Maine Blueberry Pancakes  with warm maple butter3. Chorizo Egg Scramble 4. Eggs, and Tomato Sauce on a breakfast muffin with a side of chicken-apple sausage and hash browns (forgot what this was called on the menu)Everything was amazing! My favorites were the chorizo scramble and the wild Maine blueberry pancakes, but everyone in our party loved different dishes so all-in-all we were all satisfied and will definitely be back on a weekday if we have a chance! 100% recommend!"
487,"Been meaning to try this place forever but reservations are hard to procure and I have little patience waiting for food - especially brunch. However, I'm glad that we made it here for a girl's brunch!I was planning to get the blueberry pancakes, but when I saw the soft shell crab Benedict special, I knew I had to get that. Turned out to be the best decision! The soft-shell crab, the fried green tomatoes, the biscuits (there were three instead of two. Not complaining!) ... just heavenly. Very hearty meal but totally worth it. I tried some of my friend's blueberry pancakes, which were also good. Service was also good during our visit, so zero complaints. Will come back and try the pancakes when the soft shell crab benedict is not in season anymore."
488,"This is a perfect place to take for a breakfast date. The pancakes were stacked and fluffy with a nice blueberry sauce. There is a sugary brown sauce which ended up being a bit too sweet for me.I got a side of fried chicken, but it was a bit dry and so I didn't end up finishing it.Overall, they have a great breakfast selection, but I wish that they had more selections for their pancake flavors. Their defaults (non specialty of the week/month) are blueberry, banana walnut, and chocolate. As someone with a nut allergy, the banana walnut looked great, but walnuts were a dealbreaker."
489,"Surely it cant be that good?Why is it so hard to get a lunch reservation?How good can a pancake get?These questions and more were all answered when I visited for a late 3pm lunch (the only reservation for 4 i could get). They were:- yes it can be that good- because the food is so yummy- really damn goodClinton St is nestled in a convenient location in LES, and is constantly bustling with activity as new yorkers scramble to get their quality pancake fix. I came at a sun drenched cold winter day and the clamor with breakfast food smells upon entering was more than inviting.The food, lawd the food was fantastic. Pictures are attached and honestly they dont do the food justice. I dont think anything except going yourself and eating then would really do the experience justice. The pancakes were delightfully fluffy, faintly sweet, and almost crispy on the browned surface, serving as the perfect accompaniment to their maple butter and colorful toppings. The waffle was decadent with the berry jam being a exquisite tart contrast to the sweet cream. The latkes were crispy and dense, delicious with the sourcream + apple sauce. The bloody mary... wasnt mine so i cant speak to it but its pretty.Mid meal i was on resy looking for the next open lunch table. Alas it looks like i will be waiting sometime for that availability."
490,"Los Tacos No. 1 has the best tacos in NYC.Both this location and the one in Chelsea Market have long lines, but it's worth the wait.For under $5 each, you have 4 taco options:- Carne Asada (Grilled Steak)- Pollo Asado (Grilled Chicken)- Adobada (Marinated Pork)- Nopal (Grilled Cactus)You have a choice of corn or flour tortilla and you could also get quesadillas with the meat for around $6.The topping options are:- Onions- Cilantro- Salsa- GuacamoleMy favorite is the Taco Adobada, which has delicious juicy marinated pork and is so flavorful.If you've never been, this is a must try!"
491,A MUST when you're in the city! It's always packed whenever we stop by but we're able to be served our tacos quickly. I personally love the al pastor tacos with corn tortillas. There's also a cheese shell for those looking to opt for a keto version!
492,"Great street style tacos very good and this location was packed with customers!  We ordered each of the different meat selection and guac, all very good!"
493,"Wanted tacos and I usually go to the location at Chelsea Market.  This was a quick walk and I went at non-peak. Steak was just ok, abodabo was a little salty but still delicious.   Flavors are good,  corn tortilla are my fav.  3 will fill  the average eater. Fresh salsa and veggies.  I wish they had birria tacos...."
494,"This place definitely surpassed my expectations. My boyfriend and I came here to eat during our visit to NY, and this was on his food bucket list. It was extremely good 9/10. The staff was super friendly and we received our food fast. The only con would be that there's limited standing area so you have to kind of have to watch whose eating and about to finish and then swoop in to their spot. I am not a big pastor fan but my boyfriend said their tacos were some of the best pastor he's ever had!"
495,"December 2021 - COVID Review:I was worried this was gonna be an overhyped tourist trap but I'm glad to be proven wrong. We got here maybe 5 minutes before they opened at 11am and there was already a long line formed. There was a staff member letting small groups go in at a time to not overload the kitchen and to not fill up the dining area.It took us maybe 30 minutes to finally get in and wait for our orders. But once you're inside to order, the food doesn't take too much longer after that to be ready. You order up front at the register and then you move down the line with your ticket and tell them if you want corn versus flour tortillas and what toppings. They have different salsas for you to self-serve on the side wall too. My husband and I got both corn and flour tortillas with the carne asada and adobada to try the different combinations and the corn tortillas were definitely the best and most authentic tasting. Super delicious and worth the ~$4 price tag per taco."
496,"Favorite taco spot in Manhattan. This place isn't meant for lingering. Rehearse your order before you reach the register, let the assembly line workers know what type of tortilla you want and def ask for con todo/everything on top. New to me was the accoutrement bar. My first visit here was during the peak of the pandemic when indoor dining was banned so seeing the salsas and radish was a delight. My brother, who has lived in ATX and San Diego, was a fan."
497,"Awesome food! I plan to come back.  I'm from Cali and love Mexican food. However, my expectation was to be disappointed when coming here  - even with the awesome reviews - but was pleasantly surprised. We had carne asada tacos, carne asada quesadillas and chips and guacamole. The quesadillas are like a normal taco but has cheese melted on the tortilla before adding the meat - don't expect a ""normal"" quesadilla. You choose between flour and corn tortillas- both of which are home made. The asada has wonderful flavor and both tortillas are wonderful- we tried both. You order your food and then take your ticket down the counter and give it to the guys there. You then tell them which kind of tortilla you want and confirm if you want all the extras that go on (onions, cilantro, salsa, guacamole). They put your plate together and hand it to you.  There is no seating. No chairs at all. They have a couple of counters you can stand and eat at if you choose to eat in. While the food is a bit pricy compared to what I am used to paying at home, I found the flavor to be worth the cost and will happily be back."
498,"I've been here twice for lunch and both times were delicious.  First time I was a bit overwhelmed as I've not experienced a place like this.  The menu is on the wall and after ordering you'll want to give your ticket to one of the team working to construct the tacos.  I was not aware of this the first time, despite seeing signs of ""No Ticket, No Taco""....I finally realized after one of my friends that was with me who had been then handed their ticket over.  I initially went to the stand-up area and waited.  Upon handing over your ticket you'll be asked if you want all the toppings..and which type of tortilla.  The tacos are nice and simple which makes them all that more delicious.  It's a great place for the short list of lunch places even though it's a bit future than my normal radius."
499,"Los tacos is one of the best taco places in New York and definitely one of my top places just in general. I just came from eating Angel's Tijuana Tacos in LA a few weeks ago, so I know a good taco when I have it.It's quick, delicious and pretty reasonably priced. I usually get steak, chicken and pork tacos with corn tortillas and everything on it. The cactus tacos are fine, but I would go for the meat ones unless you're vegan/vegetarian.There is sometimes a line, however it's well worth the wait and it usually moves pretty quickly."
500,"We came on a very busy Saturday night with no reservations and was hoping maybe we can sit at the bar. The hostess was a little unclear but she said that the bar seats are first come first serve. I asked if there were any seats opened because I couldn't see. She said I think so? Lol okMy boyfriend went towards the bar and checked and saw 2 seats opened. We got seated and our bartender was really nice and helpful.We ordered a little too much food: chicken with pancakes, chicken biscuit sandwich, midnight Mac n cheese, and mashed potatoes with mushroom gravy. The food was just okay. I was really looking forward to the meal and was hyping it up but it was underwhelming, don't get the Mac n cheese, it was very dry.The pancakes were huge and very filling, they pour syrup on it for you so you can't control how much goes on it. The chicken biscuit sandwich with sausage gravy was okay, to me that was the best thing there. The gravy was a tad on the sweet side though (FYI). The cocktails were good and served in cute mason jars. The music and vibe is cool and old school hip hop & r&b was playing. I bumped up my rating from 2 to 3 stars because of that. Overall I don't think I'll come back. The first time I came for brunch was a better experience. Maybe staff needs a bit more training and learn to show hospitality more. Come for drinks only"
501,"Jacob's Pickles is a MUST for southern cuisine! This UWS staple is pickle heaven! There is a bunch of outdoor seating as well as indoor. There are a bunch of different pickles to chose from, which you cannot go wrong with any, but our favorite was the special sours. Their southern pickle biscuit sandwiches are necessary if you come here. The honey chicken sandwich was sweeter and the hot chicken biscuit had a little kick! The mac and cheese was was good, but I do think the sandwiches are the better choice. The spicy brine margarita is one of the most interesting, best drinks I have ever had. This place is taking southern comfort food to the next level in NYC, I love this spot!⁣"
502,"This spot was real cute! I was going to grab lunch and continue to walk the city but it turned into just drinks and apps. We got brussel sprouts (not good), fried pickles (very tasty) and the poutine (amazing). The fries is what did us in! That thing was massive!! We couldn't even finish it. After the fries I couldn't dare think of a meal to follow behind it. Smh the drinks were good too. I would definitely give this sport a try."
503,"We were in the neighborhood of the museum and wound up walking to Jacob's Pickles as a pick-me-up after our plans didn't pan out. I'd heard a lot about Jacob's Pickles but had never been, and they had ample covered outdoor seating, which was so welcome on this unusually mild day in December.Yes, it's true - the portions are pretty enormous! I think my partner and I could've easily split one entree between the 2 of us. As it was, he was torn between the southern BLT and the patty melt, so our ordering decision was easy and we got one of each.I think we looked like cartoon characters the way our eyes widened as our server brought our trays of food out. My goodness. The patty melt came with an absurdly generous amount of fries. The BLT was on a biscuit so enormous that my brain didn't even accept it was a biscuit at first, and there was so much STUFF going on that I couldn't even understand how to eat it like a sandwich, the top biscuit wouldn't sit atop the massive fried chicken, green tomato, and pickle slaw pile on the bottom biscuit. And then we remembered the side of grits that came with the BLT and of course all those fries... Everything was delicious but we were honestly really overwhelmed by how much food there was, we're so used to paying similar prices for half or less the portions we received at Jacob's Pickles.Needless to say, we boxed a LOT of food for home and will be back again. I'd love to try brunch here although we lucked out with off-peak timing and were able to be seated super easily; I imagine it's a lot more poppin' during their busier hours. Come hungry and don't be afraid to share! I'm looking forward to trying more pickles and their other offerings, maybe trying to balance out what my partner and I get so we don't feel so overwhelmed by 2 fairly rich entrees!"
504,"Love this place! Been here mad times before and it's never a let down. The chicken is always cooked excellently, and as an original southerner I can say I've never been let down by the quality of the biscuits (a true art form to perfect) either. In addition to the gigantic sandwiches, they also have amazing drinks and other southern-based fare. Explore the menu and expand that waistline, baby. On my most recent trip I enjoyed the hot Nashville chicken sandwich with Vermont cheese added (see the pic).Go here fam."
505,"Hearty brunch with good service in UWS for biscuits and fried chicken.We came here on a cold and rainy Saturday morning for brunch. We got seated immediately in the outdoor dining section, which was mostly enclosed with plenty of heat lamps.Even though we were outside, the waitress checked in on us frequently and we could order quickly and get refills on coffee often. Our food came out hot within minutes of us ordering- considering the majority of menu items are just combinations of fried chicken and biscuits with different dressings, that made sense.The portions are huge here! I felt bad watching the waiters clear away other tables' plates that still had tons of food on them.... We shared the honey chicken with pickles. It comes with a side of cheesy grits which was also nice and hot (congeals as it cools down so eat quickly). We also ordered some pickles.Everything tasted great, and it was very easy to share. The food comes out quickly so if you think you'll still be hungry, ordering more food is always an option."
506,"Drop everything, go to Jacob's Pickles. This was our first stop on our fall trip to NY in early November and we were so I sensed that we went AGAIN before we flew back to Austin. The pickles are of course, incredible. Do yourself a favor and order one of the biscuit dishes, the Nashville Hot Chicken Biscuit was my FAVORITE. The deviled eggs are a MUST and if you're really hungry I recommend grabbing the fried green tomatoes too.As others have mentioned the portions are insanely huge so prepare to share or have leftovers. The service was great our first visit, very lacking on the second. The food makes up for it."
507,"Before going here, just throw away your diet. It was a fun brunch outing and the restaurant waiting time to be seated was very efficient, it took about 20 mins to be seated for 2. My friend and I were placed in outside booth and they are heated for those cold weather winds. The staff was diligent and quick with our orders. We order the Poutine, which was a great appezitar, my friend wasn't able to finish eating his sandwhich. I ordered the hot chicken which come with the side of grits. Overall, I was very happy with my ordered."
508,"Based on reviews of other ""Yelpers"" we decided to try Jacob's Pickles for ourselves. What a wonderful find!! Next time I'm in New York, this place is a must for brunch. The portions were huge and the prices were reasonable. Everyone loved their food from the chocolate chip pancakes, bacon, honey chicken biscuit to the greens and black eyed peas and Bloody Mary. The honey chicken was cooked to perfection--the crunchy coating was flavorful and the chicken was juicy. There were two big slabs of fried chicken breasts on the biscuit along with the pickles. Just wanted to give back to the yelp community for not steering us wrong."
509,"Came for brunch on a weekday so it was extremely busy. Service of course took very long. Not as concerning seeing as it is a popular spot. Food looks spectacular!! I wish I took more photos of my friends' orders. We were all very excited to dig in. However I didn't think it was very satisfying taste wise. Out of the 5 of us, 2 friends and I ordered the Croque Madame, Buffalo Chicken M&C, and the Sausage Gravy Chicken respectively. We quickly realized that they were the same preparations of chicken in different forms. I thought our meals and the deviled eggs needed more taste wise. Show stopping visuals? I just wish the meal kept up to the eye candy."
510,Best chicken sandwich I've ever had! I love Southern food and this place is perfect. Nice service with very hardworking staffs.
511,"Fun place. It feels like they are very intentionally trying to create an upbeat and friendly vibe...and it is working. Our server welcomed us and was attentive. Things happened a little slower than back home, but it was fine...we were enjoying the moment.  Also, all of the staff seemed to be hustling.  I don't mind being a little patient when everyone is working hard - and they clearly were. The food was delicious.  Our server told us that they pride themselves on ""southern-style food with generous portions"" I would say it is a perfect description if he added one word: tasty."
512,"Favorite eating/ drinking / brunch / lunch/ dining spot on the upper west side! Local New Yorkers ( who have exquisite taste), rave about this place! It's a solid comfort food style eatery. I was thrilled to eat indoors, and we all had to show proof of being vaccinated ( to sit inside). Felt comfortable knowing surrounding diners were also vaccinated. Anyhow, our party of five ordered many breakfast style dishes. And they each rated theirs a solid 5!!( see my pics for names of each meal ordered)."
513,"Wow! Got so many recommendations for this place, and it was certainly unique and didn't disappoint.Decided to go all out and order the 8 Pickle Sampler - definitely had enough for extras to take home and enjoy later. My personal favorite were the carrots. The Mac and cheese was creamy and to die for. I really enjoyed the fried pickles as well! BBQ smothered pepper jack chicken was sweet and tangy - went well with all the pickles. Staff told us ""calories don't count here"" so we took their advice and we have no regrets. Definitely worth visiting at least once while in the city."
514,"If you're looking for Southern Comfort Food, this is the place to go!!! Some friends had heard some good things about this place and it did not disappoint. We ordered the pickle flight and I've never tried pickled carrots or green beans. The two pickles we picked were also really good. After we finished the pickle flights, the rest of the food came. I really enjoyed the way the fried chicken was cooked, it didn't feel too heavy or oily but it really hit the spot. Pancakes were fluffy and soft. The brussel sprouts were also delicious, sweet and savory. The midnight mac and cheese was cheesy but not too heavy, eggs paired nicely and there was some jalapeño sprinkled on.I would totally come here again, portions are huge and everything split among my party of 6, total for me was like $16 -- PRETTY DANG GOOD FOR NYC. Stop by if you're craving some good comfort food :)"
515,"Really delicious and comforting Southern food with massive portions. When I say massive, I mean MASSIVE. We got a side of fries and it was literally the most gigantic bowl of fries ever (it looked barely touched at the end despite all 7 of us digging at it). The vibes here were casual and fun and they played good music. There's really not much to complain about! The only thing I'd say is that one of their hostesses was pretty rude when we went up to her to check in for our reservation. We simply asked whether we could be seated as one friend was running a few minutes late and instead of just saying no, she rolled her eyes and gave us a lot of attitude before saying ""what do you think."" Our server was very friendly so it might have just been a bad apple (or should I say pickle)."
516,"Public Service Announcement: The French toast here is to die for. The standard on the menu sounded delicious enough (with strawberries and powdered sugar), but our wonderful server Caroline clued me into the cinnamon pumpkin biscuit version -- with yams, powdered sugar, and thyme. The whole dish was dense with warm autumn comfiness, but the yams dusted with powdered sugar absolutely stole the show. This is one HEARTY brunch and the portions are huge! The outdoor heating lamps weren't able to be turned on this morning due to construction nearby (I think that was the reason) so just keep that in mind if you go on a cold day."
517,"Went here for brunch on a Sunday in a party of 4.  You must show proof that anyone over the age of 5 has taken the Covid vaccines. I like that. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our Server was quite knowledgeable about all menu items we inquired about, which  helped us to make great choices!! We decided on one of the remaining holiday specials Eggnog Biscuit French Toast, also Shrimp& Grits with Bacon and Cheese Grits, a side pancake for our grand, as well as a side side of scrambled eggs, bacon, and of course a brunch cocktail: The Jar Strawberry Lemonade, which is made with gin and  fresh strawberries on top. HELPFUL HINT: GET ONE!! it was delicious!! But I digress, first let me explain that their ""Biscuits"" are more like a soft yummy cornbread. They are sliced like square pieces of cornbread as well. Don't let this put you off, they are very good. The Eggnog French Toast was delicious! I will say this, the eggnog whipped cream on top was not good at all. But once removed, and with the addition of a touch of Syrup, this dish was heavenly. The pancake was a bit dry but with syrup as well, my grand enjoyed it.  The shrimp and grits was very good as well. The grits were cooked to a really creamy consistency which was nice, the bacon crumbles were plentiful, and shrimp generously added and nicely seasoned. Really nice brunch spot.  I'd recommend it."
518,"Overall: Great southern comfort food; great drink selection; average service, loud and energetic atmosphere/energy; really great priceMy go to place for fried chicken - highly recommend the hot chicken biscuit. Its super spicy but super super good! They also have great grits and poutine! Their prices are very reasonable and their drink selection is varied and is also on the more affordable side. The outdoor dining is very casual and the indoor is also casual but not as casual as the outdoor area. The service is fine - they aren't that nice but they also aren't rude. The inside is very loud - we had to shout to hear each other and by the end of dinner we lost our voices :( Still a great place if you're missing that southern fried chicken!"
519,"I come here for cheat days or if I want quality food, getting bang for my buck. They changed up the menu, so it's alot easier to pick something. I got the deviled eggs and for my main I got a hot chicken sandwich. I wish they always had the ginger beer! Always a great time there, vibes, music etc... long time patron!"
520,"Pretty solid. Came here for weekend brunch with friends. DEFINITELY TAKE NOTE, make a reservation. If you try to do a walk-in you will have to wait for forever."
521,So good! Came here on a Monday evening for a late dinner with a friend who's been here once before and I was thoroughly impressed. We shared a couple things and a bottle of their sparkling wine. We later found out that they were actually out of the bottle but the manager went to their sister restaurant and brought a bottle back.To eat we shared the Biscuits and Gravy with mushrooms. So good! I'm a sucker for anything with mushrooms and the gravy did not disappoint. We also ordered the Homemade Slow Cooked Meatballs which was equally fantastic. Would highly recommend this place!
522,"Nice southern comfort restaurant. Just know the portions are HUGEEEEEEEThe patty melt was good but nothing exciting, the honey chicken is really good , if you like honey and your chicken on the sweeter side , than this is for you. The Buffalo Mac and cheese is delicious!!! Service was attentive and excellent"
523,"First time back after 5 years and the food is still amazing. Definitely a place for comfort food and gigantic portions. The fried chicken was amazingly tender and juicy which as someone who prefers dark meat, was amazing and surprising. The wait to get a table during week day lunch was about 20 minutes and they gave us a texted when our table was ready. Two people and we ordered 3 apps and 3 entries and we were definitely bringing stuff home. Food was worth the wait."
524,"Found this place on the food network and immediately searched for it on Yelp to bookmark it. Made it a mission to visit this place on a trip to NYC years ago and never turned back. Every time I drive to NYC we stop here for a southern lunch or dinner.What's the rave?! Well for starters, the chicken is amazing. Juicy, tender, and well paired with either a buttery gravy, grits, biscuits, or fries. The poutine is a mountain! Make sure to share that with the entire table. The wait might be long but this place is worth the wait."
525,"Extra! Extra. If you didn't know Jacob's Pickle is over the top in most things. Please be sure to arrive with a large appetite or a large group (for sharing), or a big bag to carry your leftovers.I have never finished any of their meals in full, in one sitting. The food is cooked right, but it is a lot to manage. Although it sounds like I'm describing myself, this is really how Jacob rolls.  Their franchise has expanded from Maison pickle to Tiki Chick and who knows what's next?! Either way, expect that it will be extra.The place is clean and gets packed pretty quick as it is trendy with tourists and locals alike. Anytime an acquaintance wants to frequent this spot, I like to prepare them for excess. Did I mention their libations are also pretty Extra? Well, they are.  Service is friendly and efficient.  If you can snag a seat and have a hankering for an Extra type of time: Come here!"
526,"I tried this restaurant during Restaurant Week 2022 with a friend and made reservations in advance.When I arrived I informed the hostess of my reservation and she asked if me party was complete. I explained to her that my friend was parking and she instructed me that I could wait out outside or at the bar. I must note that for a hostess she was not very pleasant or friendly. When my friend arrived she said the same before I mentioned it.Once my friend arrived we were seated and ordered. But while waiting for our food a lady sat next to us alone and when a waiter approached she said she was waiting for a friend. I definitely did not appreciate hearing that conversation and I would have rated this restaurant higher had I not heard it. Her friend arrived soon after but both my friend and I definitely made note of that.To drink I ordered the jam jar which was delicious and not too strong. For my appetizer I had the deviled eggs and they were delicious. The portion served was also surprisingly large. The baby back ribs were very tender but too salty for me. The sides were potato salad and pickle slaw. The slaw was pretty good but I didn't like the potato salad at all because it was very bland. The potato salad to me looked to be simply potato, mayo and bacon sprinkled on top. I also didn't appreciate that my baby back ribs were nestled in that colorless, bland potato salad. My friend said she enjoyed the lemonade, matzo ball soup and biscuit sandwich she ordered. She also had a side of the Mac and cheese that she enjoyed. I tasted it and it was just ok to me. Dessert was banana pudding for me and my opted for the ice box dessert. Neither of us had complaints about the desserts. Overall, I don't see myself returning anytime in the future solely based on both our separate encounters with the hostess. Her attitude was poor and she was clearly racist. The woman she allowed to be seated while waiting for her friend was white but she told me I could wait outside or at the bar. Definitely, not equal treatment of customer's. Personally I never choose to make a commotion with people serving me food and I our meal hardly began. Instead I believe actions speak louder than words so no I have no plans to return in the future."
527,"One of our favorite upper west side restaurants and it never fails..we went with the Buffalo Mac and cheese, poutine, mushroom a d gravy friend chicken and lastly, ended it with their pumpkin bread pudding. Everything was AMAZING. The buff chix mac and cheese was to die for. The perfect blend of melted cheese with blue cheese dressing, oh my. And you can never fail with their poutine. Mounds and mounds of fries with melted cheese. We also got extra gravy. It's the way to go. The mushroom gravy chicken sandwich was also so tasty. Crispy, juice and a hefty amount of meat. It comes with a side of their delicious grits. To top everything off, the pumpkin biscuit bread pudding with vanilla ice cream, oh my goodness. So soft, so tasty. The picture doesn't do it justice. We will always come back but for the next couple days, we have left overs."
528,"Amazing food, large portions, good prices. Must get the pickles and fried chicken!I was super bummed I couldn't participate in restaurant week when I booked a Saturday night reservation and distinctly called it out in the booking (their social and restaurant week didn't say Saturday was excluded) but the food quality, portion and overall experience was worth it all in all. The pickle sampler and the fried chicken entrees were the best hands down. We got the classic and the BLT chicken sandwich entrees which came on their amazing homemade biscuits and a side of grits. The Mac and cheese was good but not best ever (more melted cheese than gooey Mac) so maybe skip and go for the loaded fries or deviled eggs. The vibe is loud and partyish so be prepared for that! It was more lounge feeling than restaurant. Portion wise, we could barely eat half our meal and had to take half the pickles and entrees home! I wish we had more room to try dessert because I heard they are awesome. Will definitely go back."
529,A must try!!! I would go here again on my next NYC trip. My friend and I ordered the fried chicken and Busch it's. The meal was huge. The flavors were so original. My friend ordered the spicy chicken buscuit which had a very unique hot sauce flavor. I ordered the mushroom buscuit which was super creamy and balanced well with the sharpness of the cheese. The service was also very friendly.
530,"This is the kind of place you keep coming back for more. And every time, its JUST as good as the last. This place is hands down the BEST in terms of hearty, feel food, comfort foods. Everything is home made and you can just TELL. The portions are out of control, super well priced and the staff are all so nice. Still haven't been able to snag a table indoors, but the vibes inside just looks so F U N. Must get: The Street Corn, The Slow cooked Meatballs, Poutine, Biscuits with Mushroom Gravy and the Hot Chicken Biscuit. Get ready to be STUUUUUFFFEDDD. Everything was superb but the corn....I don't know what they did to it but as I was chowing down on it/ making out with it- I declared that I was going to marry it. I DO!!!"
531,HUGE PORTIONS! I think Jacob's Pickles is the best Southern comfort food you'll get in NYC. We had so many leftovers. Brussels sprouts with honey and bacon were so savory. Egg was perfect runniness for me and the fries were crispy too. This is a really heavy meal so my tip is to get a glass or two of orange juice here which is freshly squeezed and absolutely refreshing after all those carbs! Service was really friendly and the place was already seating a lot of people right at opening: we were lucky we came early so I suggest you do too if you don't want to wait long!
532,"I've lived on the UWS for 9 years and this is still my go to restaurant. Epic proportions, insanely delicious, and fun vibes. During the pandemic we ordered delivery from them every weekend to make sure they stayed alive. JP's for life!!"
533,Omggg this place Is a classic Brunch place! I've been a few times and every time I'm impressed with the food and drinks! The wait time can be bananas as you can imagine it's that good! I have not been post Covid but I'm sure if everything stayed the same it's Not gng to disappoint anyone!
534,"I've been dying to go back to Jacob's Pickles since our first experience there. My boyfriend and I were over the moon with our huge portions, delightful waiter, delicious drinks, and finger-licking-good comfort food.We initially were going to walk straight past this place. Then I saw the biscuits. Then I checked my Yelp bookmarks. Yep. JP was on the list.We were quickly seated and met by our cheery waiter, who was very helpful in choosing drinks. He was friendly without seeming inauthentic and had a general enthusiasm for the restaurant and their offerings.We ordered the biscuits with all the fixins as a starter. The biscuits themselves are really good, but the homemade strawberry jam and maple butter put them over the top. I wish the fixins weren't served in disposable paper condiment cups; firstly because they're not reusable, but also because scraping jam, butter, and honey out of soggy paper cups is not easy or fun.The chicken and pancakes were so delicious. Two chicken breasts, two humongous pancakes, and lots of bacon crumbles and syrup. I took a whole breast and pancake home for later, even after sharing a sizeable chunk with my boyfriend. This is a massive dish.My boyfriend ordered the buffalo mac n cheese, and when I say I was jealous, I mean I've never been closer to punching someone out for their food. Again, massive portion. He couldn't finish it all. When it was time to heat up the leftovers, it was so hard for me to relinquish them to him instead of horking them secretly. If you love cheese, this is the dish for you.For my drink, I had the Jam Jar, which our waiter recommended. It's made with house-made strawberry jam and fresh-squeezed lemonade and is a dream of a cocktail on a hot summer day.We'll definitely head back to JP. I need the mac n cheese."
535,"Looking through the menu at home, we quickly realized that this is a very interesting restaurant. We came here for an early dinner (around 6pm) and got a table outdoors immediately. Our table was large, and the tables, in general, were spaced nicely apart. The sidewalk was only moderately busy with people passing by now and then, but by no means intrusive on the experience. Our server was attentive and friendly, and each dish was plentiful. Pumpkin Biscuit: This was one of the specials for the day. The fluffy cinnamon pumpkin biscuits were met with a number of preserves (strawberry and marmalade), butters (regular and maple), and honey. This item was awesome; the biscuit had the consistency of cake/cornbread, and tasted really good paired with the various accompaniments. I would highly recommend. Honey Chicken and Pickles: I liked this as well. Again, the biscuits that accompanied the chicken were similar to cornbread/cake -- all topped with honey and combined with chicken. The chicken was crispy and done well. The cheese grits were really good as well; this was a great side and much more interesting than just fries. Suggestion: I would fine-tune the seasoning on the fried chicken and get a little more wild here. The chicken is good as it is, but really, it is best paired with the honey-topped biscuit. Getting a little daring with the seasoning would allow the chicken to really stand on its own. Price: 4/5Quality: 5/5Quantity: 5/5Service: 5/5Atmosphere: 5/5"
536,"I came here on a friday night excited for some southern food (I was born in the south) but left disappointed. The food overall is fine, but the portions are ridiculously huge, distracting from the average quality. The lights are dimmed and they play obnoxiously loud top 10 hits the whole time. Would be fun for a birthday or large group but if you are a foodie, skip it."
537,"I was visiting NYC for the weekend and I was craving brunch food. Thankfully I  found this place on Yelp in walking distance from my hotel. Outside seating: Plenty of seating inside and outside.Reservation: not sure if they take reservation but thankfully they were able to accommodate my party of 12 at 2 separate table. Food: Jacob's Petty Melt with fries. The sandwich was on Texas toast with a mountain of fries. The portion was so large I couldn't finish it. 5/5The Hot Chicken Biscuit was on a homemade Biscuit that seem more like a thick peace of cornbread ( soooo good) There were 3 Chicken breast on the sandwich smh all for one person   5/5Service: Our waitor was very knowledgeable about the menu and provided great suggestions. He was nice and patient.Overall, this was a great find. There were plenty of options on the menu which made it hard to decide. The portions are large enough for two people (bring your appetite). The location is nice and the service was awesome. I highly recommend a visit."
538,"Looking for southern comfort food in Manhattan? Look no further..... Jacob's Pickles delivers! Despite my husband hating pickles, he agreed to give this place a try since I promised to eat his pickles if it infiltrated his food. I cannot speak for trying to get into this place over the weekend as I'm sure its hectic, but we came by with no reservation on a Monday around lunch/brunch time and did not have to wait for an indoor table. There was a wait for a ""patio"" table, but we were hungry. We we seated in the back room of the restaurant which was spaced out, and tables were socially distanced. Our waitress and servers all wore masks and made the experience seamless! Shoutout to our waitress and the kitchen - they let me alter my order and switch up the dish to my content even if it wasn't an option on the menu, super flexible!We both ordered the following dishes and absolutely loved them:1. HOT CHICKEN BISCUIT - Buttermilk Fried Chicken, Nashville Hot Sauce, Hot Sour Pickles - Served with grain miller organic cheese grits- Thoughts: SO GOOD, I could eat this for days, chicken was tender, and the grits were perfection!2.  CROQUE MADAME - Buttermilk Fried Chicken, Sliced Black Forest Ham, Gruyere Cheese, Sunny-Side Up Eggs on a Bacon Egg and Cheese biscuit Served with Home Fries + side of sausage gravy - Thoughts: Delish! The fried chicken was great, but I think if I hadn't ordered the side of sausage gravy, the dish would have overall felt a little dry, but with the gravy, it was perfect! you can order a side of sausage or mushroom gravy with any dish, FYI! To note, portions were HUGE, so we each only finished about 1/2 of each dish, but had ample leftovers for another day, yay! Maybe if we ever go back, we could probably get away with an app and one entree to share! As a foodie, I am super picky about how things are cooked, seasoned, and presented, and I think they did a great job! We do not have any food restrictions so cannot speak for any speciality items, but for the run-of-the-mill eater, this place was awesome! Highly recommend this joint, just go on a weekday and not a weekend if you want to remain sane! Happy eats!"
539,"Delicious chicken and grits!! Came here on a super hot day, but still ordered the Hot Chicken!Got the Hot Chicken, Honey Chicken, and their biscuits of the day--Lemon + Blueberry. Both chicken dishes came with grits--the chicken was incredibly good and the Hot Chicken was my favorite. So good with the biscuit underneath soaking up all the sauce goodness! The Biscuits of the Day were good, not great in my opinion--a little dry.We sat outdoors where there was an overhang--thank goodness since it started to rain. They have a cute outdoor area and large indoor area. Indoor is nicely air conditioned which is important in the recent heat!Waiter was very kind and had amazing nails :)Recommend coming here to eat lots of chicken, just on a cool day!"
540,"I have to start with... IDK if they play the same music every day, but the day I visited, the music was PHENOMENAL! It brought back to my days of high school and college, which completely ages me. SHHHH! But I just wanted to dance and sing, like, the whole time.The food... awesome. And BIG portions. Definitely come hungry or ready to share!My friend and I ordered more than we should have, but when on vacation... why not?I am usually not a fan of deviled eggs, but they were sooo yummy and filled with filling.Mac & cheese... great! Chicken... great!Pickles... great!Everything was GREAT!I'll definitely be visiting again when I go back to NYC."
541,"I'm a fan of Jacob's pickles for southern style food. Biscuits on point; grits on point, never been disappointed."
542,"This place was recommended by our Airbnb host in December. Loved it so much, we came again for date night on our return trip in January. The vibe is cool, the beer is good. We really love the fried green tomatoes and the chicken & biscuits. Warning: some of the desserts are MASSIVE."
543,"Jacob's pickles was a great pit stop for us on our journey up the Upper west side.We were seated quickly, the interior was very loud but had pretty good ambiance. I question their music choice somewhat. Our server Cameron was polite and our water was refilled on time.We ordered the Hot Chicken Biscuit and the Sausage Gravy Smothered Chicken. Both were very good; the Hot Chicken Biscuit was better. The grits were really nothing special, but the pickles and biscuit were excellent. The ""Nashville hot sauce"" was, like most other things in new york, not spicy at all.The chicken itself was done quite well. The portion looks big because they hide the chicken with bread."
544,I can't stop thinking about this food. The staff was so nice and attentive even though they had a ton of tables and they were enthusiastic about the food. The food portion is huge so I was able to take home leftovers and it tastes so incredible. I will be thinking about it for days. Be sure to have some of the maple syrup on the side and I also loved the root beer on tap.
545,"I found this restaurant on the nyc.go website, trying to find a new place for restaurant week and I was not disappointed! For cocktails I ordered the Autumn Grog and my friend ordered the Kentucky porch sipper. My drink has the right amount of alcohol and flavor. Neither my friend or I was a fan of the Porch sipper, it was ""punchy"" and too sweet. We had no complaints about the food, and the portions were huge, especially for restaurant week. We ordered the corn bread, meatballs, honey chicken sandwich, sausage gravy chicken sandwich, the Oreo jar and the banana pudding. I wouldn't usually order meatballs, but they were delicious! The cornbread was baked or perfection, and my sausage gravy chicken sandwich was very tasty. I almost forgot, the entrees were served with baked Mac and cheese, which was my least favorite. We took more than  half of the food home because we were so stuffed. Lastly, the service was great and the music was even better. Our waiter was very friendly and gave us good recommendations. We're already planning to return in the near future."
546,Went here on a weekend without reservations.  It only took us 20ish minutes to get seated with a party of 4 I had a Bloody Mary and mimosa.  They were both alright but don't know if I would get either again. We started with fried pickles which were soo good.  The friend chicken with gravy was the best fried chicken I have ever had.  The portion was so big I had leftovers for breakfast the next day. The Buffalo Mac and cheese was also one of the better macs I have had.  All of the food was amazing.  Go just get.  The portions are HUGE.  Everything coming out of the kitchen looked so good.  Definitely want to go back and try other things.  Will be back for sure!
547,"I have been meaning to visit ever since my wonderful experience at Maison pickle!tldr: I liked maison pickle betterAmbiance- loud music, much more casual than maison. I much prefer the indoor dining at maisonService- Not as good as maison, took forever to get seated even though we had a reservation (no excuses there). Took forever for a server to take our order and fill our waters. Food- Absolutely delicious. We had the poutine, and boy was this thing massive. I would not recommend ordering this unless you have a table of at least 4 splitting it. Their entree sizes are already massive as is, so don't expect to have space for dessert. We had the meatloaf and the sausage gravy chicken sandwich. Both were amazing but huge."
548,"Don't go unless you absolutely love southern food. Southern food isn't my favorite, so this place didn't do it for me. I recommend making a reservation because it can get busy. We started with the fried pickles. The fried pickles are spears not chips. The pickles have a ""fresh"" taste to them, so it might be the fried pickles that you're used to. For the meal, I had the Hot Chicken Biscuit. For the sandwiches, they put something on the ""Hot Sour Pickles"" that makes them taste terrible. My friend and I had to scrape the pickles off our sandwiches. The chicken was tender and was the best part of the sandwich. Overall, the biscuit and breading on the chicken were super rich, almost too rich. The portions here are generous which is nice. Overall, I wasn't a fan of this place."
549,"Ugh, do I really even want to write a review of this place, there's already like 30000 others. Ok fine, I'll be brief. Came here with a group of friends. Super casual brunch spot. I had a personal agenda aka Mission Biscuit.Everything is served in super large portions so if you like sharing with friends, that might be the thing to do. We ordered the Caesar salad, poutine, mac, the biscuit special of the week, and corn. The biscuits did not live up to my expectations. Maybe they make them in extremely large batches and that's why they tasted a bit stale?I would still return to try other things on the menu though!"
550,"Amazing spot for brunch with delicious food and great portions. I got the chicken and pancakes and my partner got the biscuit french toast with blueberries. We actually got the biscuit french toast bc we misheard it as a brisket french toast, so we were a bit saddened when it came and there was no brisket; however this sadness only lasted a moment bc once we took a bite, we were beyond glad we ordered the dish. It was dense and moist with a bit of crunch on the sides. There was heaping piles of whipped cream on top and chunks of blueberry throughout. Would highly recommend to any sweets-lover like myself!!!The chicken and pancakes was huge with two big pieces of crunchy chicken and two pancakes. The pancakes were the size of my face. The chicken pieces were coated in a decent layer of batter (not to thin so there was enough crunch to enjoy but also not too thick to create a strange gooey layer). It reminded me of popcorn chicken except there was a lot more meat and it was very juicy. The pancakes were pretty standard but they were huge and went well with the chicken.Will definitely be coming back and trying the rest of the menu!!"
551,"Big portions. Amazing comfort food a little on the expensive side but worth it. Got the mac & cheese, pickle sampler, the chicken honey biscuit, flying mule, and the vanilla buscuit pudding."
552,"This place is absolutely bananas!!! If you comein for brunch be ready for a fun, energetic vibe! The place was absolutely packed, felt like  pre-rona times!!! They check vax status at the door and the seating was definitely more relaxed, where everybody was very close to each other. The serving sizes are HUGE! Our only mistake was ordering starters and entrees at the same time! We hardly made a dent in the poutine and Mac before our chicken and biscuit entrees made it out. The red velvet biscuits bread pudding is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! didn't know it was a thing until we ordered our dessert and she said the red velvet one? I'm a sucker, so of course I said yes! OneBITE and I was in heaven, so amazing!!! This 10000% is an indulgent meal, the potions are amazing, and the flavor is even better!!! Highly recommend, and the food as leftovers are just as good if not better!! Prepare to loosen your belt buckles!!!"
553,"We showed up on a Saturday without a reservation. Luckily we were seated within 30 mins. Service was really good. They were fast and on top of everything. Started with drinks for the table. The Bloody Mary was really good and came with a giant piece of bacon. The deviled eggs were so good. They were also massive. Word to the wise, portion size is INSANE. So don't over order. The mushroom gravy chicken was phenomenal, even when we ate it the next day. Just delicious!! The Buffalo Mac and cheese was one of the best Buffalo macs I've ever had. It was honestly fantastic. I will definitely be coming back here. I'm happy I don't live closer because I'd be overeating every single week. The pricing is extremely reasonable for the amount of food you get. If you can make a reservation, I'd highly recommend you do to skip the wait times."
554,"I'd give it a 3 1/2 overall, but I went there as a vegetarian. If you eat meat, you'd probably love it. The portions are HUGE. A bit over the top for me.Loved the deviled eggs. The fried pickles were ok, nice batter but not my favorite. The omelette was ok.Expect a wait!"
555,"Updated because from the pandemic onward they do reservations through Resy / Google which solves for my complaint from the previous review. The Buttermilk Fried Chicken Country Wedge salad & the Chicken and Pancakes have been the go-to dishes for my boyfriend and I lately, you can't go wrong though. Also get a cocktail, they're great! The Bloody Mary comes with a piece of bacon and half a hard-boiled egg, nearly a meal on its own!"
556,"We came here for dinner on a weekday without any reservations and waited for about 10 minutes before being seated. The music is played super loud inside and can be overwhelming. What we ordered: Collard Greens (5/5) --smokey, savory, acidic perfection Brown Sugar Bacon Brussels Sprouts (4/5) --a bit undercooked, good flavorMidnight Mac (5/5) Chicken + Pancakes (3/5) -- good chicken, disappointing frisbees of pancakes for both plates ordered Meatloaf (5/5) -- must eat the meatloaf and potatoes together !!!Sausage Gravy Smothered Chicken (2/5) -- gravy a bit runnier than I prefer and needed more seasoning, biscuit too dry and crumbly, grits like quick setting cement On the upside, portions are huge and the service is good. Would come back just for the sides."
557,"Came here on a Sunday in the summer with no reservations, so I anticipated having to wait a while. My friends and I waited about an hour for our table.When we got to our table, we noticed that folks were starting to be cleared out, and we requested that we be moved to a table that wasn't in direct sunlight, and the waiter refused and said that the other empty tables were for folks with reservations. Normally I wouldn't make a fuss about this, but even after 30-40 minutes no one had sat at those tables, and walkins ended up sitting at those tables.Coming to the food, we ordered the poutine, biscuits and fixins, Buffalo Mac and cheese, hot chicken sandwich, and honey chicken sandwich. This was my first time ever having poutine, and while I found it delicious, my friend who has had authentic poutine said that this wasn't the real thing. The cornbread came with an assortment of jams and honey butter, and was so so moist and delish, thoroughly enjoyed that! The star of the show for me was the Buffalo Mac and cheese, I simply couldn't get enough of it!!!! The cheese pulls were immaculate!The fried chicken sandwiches however, were unimpressive for me, and the hot chicken sandwich specifically was way way too oily.The wait staff was kind of rude, and the fact that there was only one accessible bathroom was pretty irritating. Highly recommend this place as a one visit type of joint for the experience, but recommend reservations!!!"
558,"Stopped by for brunch on a Tuesday morning. We were seated right away  and the restaurant was not too crowded.We ordered deviled eggs ($12), mushroom gravy smothered chicken ($17), and the catfish tacos ($21).Our experience here didn't start off on the best note. We noticed that our utensils still had some food bits stuck on the forks and knives and asked for them to be replaced. Our waiter was very courteous and immediately replaced it for us. First, we got our deviled eggs. We were a little disappointed that some of the eggs were broken and the mustard seeds were missing on one of the eggs. Not a big deal, but you might say that the devil is in the details. The overall taste was good. Everything was seasoned well and the filling was very rich but not overpowering. The mustard seeds on top added a pop to the taste, which again made it disappointing that one of the eggs were missing them.Next, we received our entrées. The biscuits in the mushroom gravy smothered chicken was by far the best biscuits I've ever had. I had no idea that biscuits can be so good and I typically don't enjoy eating biscuits. The gravy and mushroom were also very good. The portion did not disappoint, you will not leave hungry with this dish. Unfortunately, everything else was pretty mediocre at best. The chicken tasted similar to frozen store bought chicken. The catfish tacos were our biggest regret given that we paid $21 for them. They were bland and pretty tasteless on their own and the texture felt like they needed to be cooked more.Overall, I would recommend this place for brunch that doesn't look like your typical brunch spot but would hope the restaurant does a better job with certain things that were disappointing from our experience."
559,Super tasty food and amazing fried pickles. Portions are huge and we'll worth the price. I would definitely come here again
560,"Hands down the BEST pizza place I have ever had! During our visit, we tried the No. 2 (cherry tomato, bufala mozzarella, garlic, sea salt) and No. 4 (tomato, mozzarella, arugula, and prosciutto) specials. We ordered 2 large pizzas which was plenty for our group of seven. The pizza was fresh, crispy, and incredibly flavorful without being too greasy or heavy and had the perfect toppings to cheese ratio! The only drawback is that the specials could not be modified to meet everyone's dietary restrictions. Additionally, Juliana's does not take reservations so I recommend being prepared to stand in line for bit- although the wait is well worth it!!! All of the waitstaff and hosts were incredibly kind and the host would give us periodic updates about when we could expect to be seated. All in all, I highly recommend stopping by this cozy little pizza place conveniently located within walking distance of the Brooklyn Bridge and the best ice cream place in NYC, Ample Hills!!"
561,"pizza here is pretty good! Delicious, crispy, and thin bread, which help to highlight the fresh ingredients and flavors from the cheese, sauce, and toppings on top of the pizza. they make their pizzas and dough fresh. you can literally see them making them if you look at the kitchen in the back. It's quite fun to watch if you're sitting around there.Service was great. Our table was constantly checked on. Everyone working there was so attentive and my water got refilled like ten times without me even asking. Food came out quickly. We had 5 people. Came on a warm Saturday at 5:30 and got sat down almost immediately. Wud def be open to coming back!"
562,"What excellent NY style pizza!Pretty straight forward menus, pick your size, your toppings Not much options in the realm of appetizers, which is fineI usually only order appetizers if the pie is going to take a while, but service is pretty quick hereWe ordered the meatballs to start, pretty standard meatball, well executed, juicy, on a bed of tomato sauceWe got the No.3 pizza which had sausage and broccolini, terrific thin crust, the cheese is super fresh, the ground sausage was savory, the broccolini    had a nice crunch from the ovenService was attentive and the prices are reasonableParking in the area is a pain"
563,"Got a large pie, half white and half margarita. I really liked both of them. The white sauce was especially flavorful and tasty. The only downside was that because of how thin and floppy the pizza was, it got cold extremely quickly.Other than the taste, I liked how you could see the chefs making the pizza right in front of you - pretty cool experience - and reassuring because you know they're making it fresh!"
564,"There are two things keeping me alive these days.1. Memories of thin New York pizza from Juliana's in Brooklyn.2. .........and, now back to your regularly scheduled pandemic."
565,"Not really too impressed!No 1 $32: with pancetta, mozzarella, and white truffle. The Italian bacon was the best part of this pizza because that was pretty much the only thing I could taste. Pretty thin, but not cheesy or stuffed enough. Good garlicky flavor! But definitely did not taste that truffle. For me, a sign of a really amazing pizza is when I willingly eat the crust (yes, I am thattt person that doesnt eat crust). I didn't for Juliana's. It's a good pie, but not amazzzing like everyone has said. Wouldn't wait in line or come back another time kinda place.Margherita with Mushrooms $29: this is the one that ruined it for me. Either the tomato sauce had gone bad, or if their signature sauce is very much on the sour side, then it just wasn't very appetizing. Considering there was only one topping for this one, the pizza was also very soggy, even the very first slice I picked up. Could use more cheese and more basil as wellPretty good white pie (aside from the nonexistent advertised truffle taste), but wouldn't be able to stomach their margherita again."
566,"There's always a line outside for this restaurant and Grimaldi's so I never got to try this famous joint! Decided to come here for lunch with an out of town friend because she wanted to check out the area! I arrived 15 minutes before they opened and there was already a line!! I waited about 25 minutes before getting seated, which isn't bad at all. A reminder that everyone in your party has to be there or you'll be skipped. My friend and I ordered a medium classic pizza (half margherita half white) and an order of the house made meatballs! The marghetita pizza was amazing! It tasted so fresh and the crust had flavor somehow too. We didn't like the white pizza as much but still wasn't bad! The medium pie and meatballs ended up being plenty of food for the two of us. We left feeling very full. The staff was also attentive and made sure our waters were replenished! Would definitely recommend coming here to try their pizza but maybe try to come as soon as they open to avoid the long wait."
567,Amazing Margherita pizza! My bf and I did a Brooklyn pizza tour and checked out 9 places for pizza. This place was #4 on our list. We waited a little over 20minutes outside to get seated but it was a fun part of the experience.Very lively and busy inside with people coming in and out. Pizza came out in 5minutes. Very thin which made it so easy to devour this pie.We loved the thin crust and the fresh sauce. We gave this pizza a solid 9/10! Service was great and the inside was very clean!
568,"YUM is the only thing that comes to mind when talking about Juliana's. After a long day hanging out in DUMBO, I wanted something light and satisfying. Although the wait time was about an hr long it was well worth it. The menu was full of creative options, but I kept it simple with cheese, sausage, and pepperoni. The crust was thin but not floppy, the cheese had a nice pull to it, they were generous with the toppings, and most importantly, the pizza wasn't greasy.I loved that they use a brick oven to make their pizzas, you rarely see that these days and it definitely played a part in why our pies came out within minutes.The restaurant is small and they really pack you in there. Unless you got a table for two against the wall, you were sharing a table with strangers. Luckily were seated right before they closed to prep for the afternoon rush so it was only a tight squeeze for a little bit. Other than the wait time to get into this place, it was amazing!"
569,"I hate leaving bad reviews but I'm not a fan.  I was excited, especially with the 4.5 star on yelp.  This is a pizza restaurant and the pizza lack everything a pizza should be.  Maybe it's their style and I don't understand it but I didn't like it.  My friend didn't as well.  I should have known since none of my NY friends recommend it.  A good pizza you would eat it's crust too but we didn't.  The dough was too soft for my test. The last two slices, I ate just the toppings on the pizza.  Felt like I wasted a meal while in NY.  The meatball was good and service was nice.  Owner was friendly too but I would skip and go somewhere else for some NY Pizza."
570,"One word: Tasty! The pizza is super thin and has a nice little crisp to it with a great tasting crust! We took the pizza to go cause it was absolutely crazy inside. For warning, it seems like it's typically busy inside so plan to potentially eat outside. Also, This pizza spot is right next to the water views and the Brooklyn bridge so parking can be tricky so id suggest if you're driving to park a little further and citi bike or walk over."
571,"After doing research, I wanted to try this amazing NY pizza that people raved about. We walked the Brooklyn Bridge to make ourselves hungry and to get to Dumbo so we can eat their pizza. It's not very far from the Brooklyn Bridge. When we got there, there was another pizza restaurant right next to them, Grimaldi's Pizzeria. Both have a long line outside the restaurants. We waited like 30 minutes and we were not close to the front of the line. But because it was just my GF and I, and we were ok sitting on the counter, we were able to cut a lot of people. The customer service was on point. Since it was our first time there, we didn't really know what to order so they waiter help us with recommendations and that was helpful. There was also a adorable little boy whom I think is the son of the owner or manager who was helping pass out menus to customers after they sat down. You can see them making the pizza from flattening the dough to adding the toppings and putting it in the oven. We got the 1/2 margarita and 1/2 white, classic pizza that allows you to add 2 toppings only. We got mushroom and prosciutto. They have 3 sizes: personal, medium and large. The personal is really small and meant for one person. We ended up getting the large ($34.82 after tax), which the two of us finished with no issue and without feeling stuffed. The crust was thin, which we appreciate. The prosciutto definitely elevated the pizza, however, it felt like it didn't belong. We ended getting that because it was recommended by some of the reviews.We came to try this famous pizza place, and we're glad that we did. But we probably wouldn't come all the way to Dumbo just to eat this. It was good, but wasn't like jaw dropping good. It was also pricy for pizza. We were expecting a wow factor but that wasn't accompanied with it during the experience. Maybe it's the way we like our pizza. We're the type who likes to stuff our pizza with all kinds of vegetable and some meat to create a mini hill on the pizza dough. But if you want pizza made in coal-fire oven and authenticity, give this place a try."
572,"Obviously saw the glowing reviews and had to check out this cute little spot in Dumbo. Very solid pizza for the price. Medium sized was just perfect for two people. We got half  Classic Margherita and half custom with pepperoni and sausage. The ingredients were very fresh and flavorful, crust was just right. Would definitely recommend for everyone to try!"
573,"Retroactive review for the multiple times I've eaten at Juliana's. Simply put, best pizza in NYC. Best.People ask me where the best pizza is, and without hesitation I say Juliana's, every single time. All of the pizza options are perfect. Some top of mind recs if you want to have fun: traditional, meatball, white, or if you're feeling frisky add pepperoni to the white.Best pizza in NYC. Period. I am a Yelp Elite and I approve this message. 10 stars out of 5."
574,"On our latest trip to the city, I finally got to try Juliana's, which had been in my Yelp NYC collection for quite some time. We ordered pasta fagioli, a personal white pizza with mushrooms, and a medium margherita with sausage. The food was ... AMAZING! I had expected nothing less, but I can't express how happy I was to finally have real pizza - the kind of pizza you can't find on the West Coast. The service was also spectacular. The staff was friendly and very attentive to our needs. I'll definitely be back on my next trip to New York!"
575,"My absolute favorite place to take out of towners to for pizza in NYC. The line was longer than Grimaldi, so you know we were in the right place. To avoid the long lines we opted to sit outside which was great because they had these heaters that pointed at you as you ate. The pizza was perfect - got the sausage margherita pizza and the No. 1 special which had: mozzarella, scamorza affumicata, **pancetta** (italian bacon), scallions and oregon-grown white truffles in olive oil - no tomato. I'd stick to the classic margherita style since the special was good just a lot, and the pancetta was kind of salty. But perfect thin crust, and sauce level, and bite!"
576,"Wow. That's the only thing I could say after eating my first slice from Juliana's. We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon and were lucky enough to be greeted with a very short line. After a quick 5-10 minute wait, our party of 7 was seated without issue. Their menu has both classic and specialty pizzas. For the classics, you can get a personal, medium (16""), or large (18"") sized pizza and add additional toppings (limit of two per pie). The specialty pizzas only come in a medium or large and cannot be customized. If you ask your server, you can also do 1/2 of one pie with another (for example, a half specialty and half plain cheese) if you'd like, but you will be charged for the price of the specialty pizza. We ordered a large of both the #1 special (mozzarella, scamorza affumicata, pancetta, scallions, and white truffles) and #2 (sliced cherry tomato, Bufala mozzarella, garlic, and sea salt), the latter at the recommendation of our server as a vegetarian option. The #2 was my favorite, but I would recommend either pie. I also ordered a cappuccino (~$4), which was excellent and comes with a small tray of sugars / sweetners. It's safe to say that we scarfed down our food without issue. Come experience the excellent flavor and service!"
577,"Came here with my husband after exploring the rest of DUMBO. My husband actually came here with his parents and brother a few months prior and said it was good, so we decided to come here together too. We sat outside and simply got a margherita pizza to share. Classic and delicious! It was cooked to perfection, and the crust was good too. No complaints!!!"
578,"Delicious pizza! I wouldn't say it's the best I've had in my life, but it was truly very good. Thin, chewy crust yet pillowy at the edges. My friend and I shared the #4 which has arugula and prosciutto, and both tasted fresh. Pizza definitely tastes better fresh rather than 10 minutes old, so eat quick. My friend and I went at 5 pm and didn't have to wait so that was also a plus."
579,Whenever we have family visiting- we bring them here. The pizza is always chef's kiss delicioso!Even had leftover and it reheated very well. We ordered a Margherita pie & a prosciutto & arugula pie. I had a root beer and my family had beer from the Brooklyn brewery. 10/10 recommend.
580,"Can you say best pizza ever?! Yeah! Best pizza ever! Tried Juliana's upon recommendation, and after trying it, I honestly can say that I believe it lived up to its name and hype. Juliana's was SO good and I wish there was more of it around the country.My bf and I were roaming around DUMBO and saw that Juliana's was nearby and decided to try it. It was a Saturday night and it was busy. We waited in line for about 35 mins or so before we were seated. It's a cute little restaurant. Very Italian. It's so funny cause Grimaldi's is right next door. Another very well-known and highly recommended pizza place. Honestly if I had two stomachs, I would have been down to try both to compare. Cause when in NYC, right?!We got the Margherita Pizza and the Marinara Pizza, large, half and half. (They let you do that!) Along with that, we got the Hearts of Romaine and Caesar salad. We wanted something to help clear our pallet as we try the pizzas. My first impression of the pizza was that it was HUGE. GINORMOUS. but it was heavenly. The pizza was very thin, NY pizzas. but the size was huge. More than enough for two people to share. The pizza was roughly $25.To start, we both had a slice of each pizza to taste and compare. Both pizzas were really good! Full of sauce and seasoning. Very flavorful. My favorite was the Margherita Pizza. It was absolutely delicious. I loved the sauce and seasoning. Very delicious. The Marinara Pizza was good too. Very cheesy and garlicky. and dipped in olive oil, WOW. The best part about the pizzas were they were drenched in sauce and cheese. I'm not a big fan of cheese but these pizzas made cheese so good. Adding the salad to our meal was such a great decision cause it was super refreshing. It helped us enjoy the pizzas even more cause we were able to eat more of it without getting tired of it. Great combo and would recommend others to try doing so!The service we received was nice. Our server was attentive. They were really busy and still, our server did what they could to take good care of us.I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. Super cute restaurant. Perfect for date night. The surrounding area is nice too. I really enjoyed DUMBO and the Brooklyn Bridge and the park nearby. Beautiful place to see the skyline at night. Perfect area for date night. Hoping to be able to return someday.I highly recommend Juliana's. I'm very glad we tried it. and honestly, just something about it is just so different from California pizza. I wouldn't be able to find anything like that in SoCal."
581,"After walking across the Brooklyn Bridge without much breakfast, my friend and I were ready for lunch. We wanted pizza and found Juliana's on Yelp for its promising pictures and reviews.Juliana's is cozy and the servers were friendly. We were instantly seated and ordered the medium pizza (half white, half margherita) to share. The brick oven pizza arrived soon after and we dug right in. Wow, I was completely blown away by how delicious the pizza slices were. I can't decide which one I liked more. The white pizza was super flavorful even though there were only a few ingredients such as garlic, olive oil, and cheese. It was extremely garlicky with just the right amount of cheese. Margherita pizza, on the other hand, tasted great with the fresh and mildly sweetened tomato sauce. Everything was seasoned perfectly. The thin crust did not have much dough as the standard pizza so thankfully I did not feel gross afterwards.I'm so glad I got the chance to try Juliana's. I still have yet to find a pizza joint in LA that tops my experience here."
582,The pizza was authentic Italian. Mamma mia! Che bello! The meatballs excellent! Would recommend
583,"Overall, quite delicious. We waited in line about 25 minutes. No reservations accepted. Served efficiently and nice staff. Arugula salad for $15, very basic flavor. Margarita pizza delicious crust and tomato sauce. Also ""No 1"" pizza with pancetta was just meh, a little too simple tasting for me. The penne puttanesca though was heaven!"
584,Best pizza in NYC!! This location has been around for years and the quality is unbeatable! We tried 1/2 white pizza with meatballs and 1/2 margherita. Easily the best margherita pizza I've ever had and the white pizza was also incredible. The sliced meatballs were the perfect topping. Their special pizzas also looked fantastic. You can't go wrong here!! Also had fun fancy sodas that I am looking forward to trying next time!
585,"Juliana's is such a staple when visiting DUMBO (so I've been told). I finally decided to give it a try with a friend, and it did not disappoint!I ordered the Margherita Pizza. It was delicious! The personal size was perfect for me. The sauce, cheese and basil ratio was well executed. It was seriously so hard to stop eating, and when I finished, I wanted more.The service was incredible. Their AC was out at the time of our visit, and the host allowed us to get a feel of the environment indoors before making a decision. He was also communicative! He checked in on us long after we were seated."
586,"We read about Juliana's and decided to check it out. We enjoyed the classic margherita pizza with prosciutto and Pepperoni and the #6 special with a bottle of wine before taking a walk across the Brooklyn bridge. I enjoyed the former though both pizzas were delicious. For desserts, we ordered a cannoli and the ring ding. The cannoli was my favorite! The whole experience was pleasant - our waiter was friendly and the food came out quickly enough. I'd definitely come here when next I'm in NY."
587,"It used to be the best Pizza in NY/Brooklyn. I still think it is the best pizza. It is pricier than other pizza joints like Joe's or Prince St, but I think quality is there if you can taste it. It is also sitting down restaurant compare to walk in and out pizza joints. Great vibe with professional staffs who are friendly and knowledgeable with the pizza. They also have some great dessert options as well. As a pizza goes, it uses great cheese and simple ingredients to compliment the pizza.Follow me on Instagram @willeatfood"
588,This is my girlfriend's favorite pizza place in all of NYC and I was not disappointed! We waited for about 10 minutes outside but quickly got seated. We ordered a half sausage and half cheese (margherita?) pie that was delicious. The crust was light yet crispy and everything was done perfectly. We also shared a cheesecake with raspberry sauce which was a great way to end the meal. Juliana's is the real deal for a great pie.
589,"Hands down one of my favorite pizzas in New York. They don't take reservations, but they have a lot of seats. If you go on the weekend, just try to go earlier around 5-6:30 so you don't have to wait as much.The base is on the thinner side- the perfect balance of chewy and crispy. This was QUALITY pizza and the margherhita pizza with no toppings was $21 for a large. You could NEVER in Manhattan or really anywhere. Truly truly amazing. Chef's kiss"
590,"Approaching 1000 reviews, I am now focusing in on all-star caliber establishments, which to me, is 4-5 star rated businesses, with over 1000 reviews left on them. Juliana's is clearly an all-star.Nestled in DUMBO, right near Brooklyn Bridge Park (and the aforementioned bridge), Juliana's brings a vintage taste to a vintage part of Brooklyn. Considering it is next to Grimaldi's (with who they have a rivalry with), I had to try Juliana's first, and I was not disappointed with the result.For $40 (more on that later), I got two items (it would have been three if not for the fact they had no cookies to make their famed Brookie), and they all left me satisfied. Each one of them deserves their own paragraph. Remember, no slices here at Juliana's, only whole pies. What do you think this is, Patsy's?I first got the Pasta Fagioli, and it is worth every penny. Perfectly portioned, excellent seasoning, everything is cooked perfectly to make this a hearty soup. The beans are meaty, there is a beautiful pork, tomato, and earthy flavor that makes this soup delicious. Before I ordered it, my server told me it is their top seller, and now I understand why. For that chilly or nasty day, or if you are under the weather, this is the perfect thing to get to remedy the situation.Then, I got their pizza. Large (yes, it is costly, $25), Margherita with half sausage ($4 for sausage - go big or go home when it comes to whole pies). I order half sausage to balance out my palate. The pizza is baked in a coal fired oven, which is why you get the leopard char on the back of the crust. Speaking of crust, it is close to perfect, only missing the mark by just a smidge. The rest of the pizza is delicious. The cheese, sauce, and sausage all marry up well. Unfortunately, the cheese is a little bit bland in some spots, but the rich sauce brings it extra life, along with the crust. The sausage accompaniment adds a deeper flavor without ruining the pie, like a lead guitarist not ruining the vocals of a powerful singer.You could get a personal pie, but then you would be missing out on all the amazing things this pie has to offer. It would be like ordering an appetizer without ever ordering the entree - it would not be the same.In the event they are out of Brookies, go to Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory and get a sundae or a shake. But one day I would like to come back and order one of these things.Definitely come and give this legendary pizza joint a go."
591,"We ordered Juliana's pizza to go.  It was a very delicious pizza.  It was a perfect size pizza for lunch.  Make sure to visit Juliana's when in Brooklyn, New York."
592,"One of the best pizzas of my life. This place really worth a visit. I would recommend ordering a large pizza for two, one small might be too much for one person, but it really depends on your appetite. Be prepared for long waiting times, even up to one hour."
593,"I. LOVE. JULIANAS. We came here for lunch around 11:40am and the place was pretty packed inside. It has been a while since we did indoor dining but they had dividers up for every table there is. We ordered a medium Prosciutto and arugula pizza and a spaghetti and meatballs, along with two lemonades. We left this spot STUFFED. the meatballs are pretty big and very tasty but the spaghetti maybe could have used a little more taste- some salt perhaps? still good but next time, I would order just the meatballs. Now, the pizza. SO GOOD. The arugula was so fresh and the ratio between the toppings made it so enjoyable to eat. We ate the entire pie and though we were so full after, it was GOOD full and not the painful type of full. Will be back for more!"
594,"Overall, okay...Got the arugula salad with goat cheese & walnuts, which was probably the best part of the meal. The goat cheese & walnuts, that are slightly sweet, are the highlight of the salad. The salad itself was well dressed & light. The pizzas were pretty disappointing. Crust is super thin, slightly charred from the coal-fired oven, good chew but the pizzas really lacked flavor and overall disappointing. The no.1 was probably closer to a 1.5/5. The main flavor was pancetta and scallion, and there was NO truffle flavor at all. It honestly reminded me of the bacon scalliom buns at chinese bakeries. It was pretty salty and there wasnt anything else on the pie to balance out that saltiness. The only reason I am rating it a 1.5 is because the crust was good,  and they definitely werent skimping on the pancetta. The no. 4 was okay. The tomato sauce was fresh and slightly sweet but I would have preferred a little more arugula. In general not bad but nothing special.Overall mediocre and besides the salty pancetta, is pretty forgetable."
595,"My husband and I were in the city and decided to grab some pizza on the way home. We remembered we had Juliana's awhile back and never get a chance to go back because it's so hard park in the neighborhood.We ordered ahead and were able to double park to pick up. We got a notification and we pulled up just as our order was marked ready.The guy outside manning the line directed me right inside for pick up. There I met Trimell. He was so nice and helpful! He found my pizzas right away and I was on my way in no time.When I got back to the car, I was reminded that I needed to use the restroom lol so I went back inside and asked if I could use theirs, mentioning that I was just there to pick up pizza. Trimell pointed me in the direction. They have 2, one upstairs and one downstairs.When I was finally leaving, I remembered I wanted to ask for the menu and about the pizzas that you can take home and make yourself. Trimell was so nice and super helpful! Even though it was busy, he made time to explain the ways to order the pizzas and made sure I had everything I needed.Thanks so much Trimell! The pizza was so good and I love the small pepperoni. My husband also really enjoyed the mushroom. The crust was really good and was wonderfully chewy.Looking forward to coming back soon! :)"
596,"Possibly the best pizza I have ate in NYC. We were: which one is the one we should go? Grimaldi or Juliana? Not sure because there are always such long lines so the moment we saw that there were no lines in any of them the question arose. We investigate about the history of both, and then it was crystal clear. OF COURSE WE NEED TO GO TO JULIANA's!!This one is the one Patsy Grimaldi owns and has his heritage, the way he males pizza and the one with coal-fired oven! Dined in on a weekday lunch time and the crowd was good but with no lines at all and a few tables empty.Needed to say, we are a family of 4 (one of them still in the stroller) so they found us a great place to place the stroller next to the table.We of course, ordered marguerita with pepperoni on one half only. OH BOY! delicious. REALLY REALLY GOOD. Ingredients were top notch. Tomato sauce was sweet and full of flavour and we were super impressed by the pepperoni as well. Thin crust. SPLENDID.Plus: open kitchen so you see how the pizza is made and thrown in the coal oven. Amazing. You also see that thwy followed Patsy's technique to prep the dough with the fingers. So in love of this place"
597,Its just ok. For the price I was expecting some prince street pizza HOLY experience but it was just a oh ok shoulder shrug and hand shaking side to side experience. If youre a new yorker...this kinda taste like 2 bros to me tbh. Sorry but not sorry.
598,"I came here with my friend for our first meal upon arriving in Brooklyn. It was a nice and sunny day, so we decided to sit outside at Juliana's. In my opinion, the outdoor seating was mediocre-- it was not particularly nice, clean, or far away enough from the road, but it was nice to have the option. I've heard so many good things about the pizza in NYC before my trip, and I had high expectations for Juliana's based on the positive reviews I read; however, I was underwhelmed with my pizza and experience.I shared a large No. 1 pizza with my friend. The pancetta was salty but good. The other ingredients were fine; however, the pizza was surprisingly greasy. In addition, I also did not feel that it was a 32-dollar pizza. I've tasted better pizzas for less elsewhere. The No. 1 pizza kind of reminded me of an Italian take on a Chinese scallion pancake. Overall, the No. 1 pizza was decent but definitely not worth the high price."
599,"If I were to rate my experience without context I'd give it a 3, however I guess that wouldn't be fair since I picked up my pizza like 20 minutes after it was ready (keeping takeout pizza in a warmer would've been a bonus though). Taste-wise it was quite good, the marinara is on the sweeter side, which I enjoy, and the crust was thin and still kind of crispy. For the price point you can definitely get better pizza elsewhere in the city, but it was still good. I guess my main suggestion would be either dine in or be prepared to get your order very quickly."
600,"After a round trip walk over the Brooklyn Bridge, it is time for some Brooklyn pizza.  The line before the open was pretty long already.  Definitely longer than Gramadis next door.  Pizza was decent, nice crispy thin crust, good cheese.  How ever the sauce was little bland.   If you are in the area, the place is worth trying."
601,"Finally returned over a year later to try the classic Margherita pizza! We ordered over the phone for pickup (please note you will have to give your credit card info over the phone) and got a Large Margherita Pie with prosciutto. It was ready within ~15 min and total came out to be $33.75. A little pricey but worth the treat.Omg, we INHALED that thing. Between the 2 of us, it was gone in minutes. If we really wanted to (completely stuff ourselves), we probably could've downed another medium pie. It was SO good and light. We loved it!"
602,"Another amazing New York experience, old school Brooklyn pizza! I've been here loads of times and it's always so good. The pizza is ultra thin style with your choice of pizza but no substitutions and changes hah. The pizza is awesome and worth the wait at this often very busy place. They have other things on the menu but it's all about the pizza! Indoor and outdoor seating is available weather dependant and anybody looking to experience true new York pizza has to try this place out. Can't wait to come back!"
603,"Pizza is served cold and burned. They brought a bottle of diet coke. Just a bottle of diet coke, no glass or straws. Until I asked for it. By that time I was done with pizza. So please don't bother coming to this place. Not worth it."
604,"I really like that the crust is thinner and not to heavy, however, i thought the crust  part was overly salty and as a result it kind of ruined the balance of the pizza for me. I'm not sure if it was just this batch though but umm quality control. The fake Cesar salad really is romaine lettuce and dressing for 14$. It was good but like I not sure if it was worth it haha. I did love the vanilla egg cream and our waiter! Juliana's is always packed from locals to tourists but we didn't have to wait long to be seated. It also seemed like #4 was the most ordered pizza while we were here. I think if I wanted Margherita pizza in DUMBO I would go next door to Grimaldi's though based on this experience."
605,"This restaurant place is very disappointing and underwhelming. The pizza was thin, soggy and burnt. No issues with it being thin but when it's soggy as burned, not a good eating experience. You could probably get better pizza somewhere else that doesn't taste like you got a burned pizza made out of a tortilla wrap. The salad is overpriced and what you get is just a mediocre salad in a cereal-bowl sized bowl. Not only that... The spaghetti is embarrassing. The portion size is small enough that a toddler would want more food. $16 for such a small portion of pasta (like I could eat it in 5 bites) is just ridiculous. Might as well just put it in the kids menu.Overall it's a tourist overhype."
606,"It was everything I've heard about it. The pie was great. I shared a medium with my wife. Not to floppy. Airy crust with very crispy ends. It was flavorful, tasty, yummy, amazing.. bottom line...  It was delicious, go eat it... now..."
607,"While visiting the market we decided to check this place out, love me some brick over pizza, we ordered the #4 this comes with tomato, mozzarella, arugula and prosciutto on a nice thin crispy crust very tasty this pizza, nice & hot right off the oven it was delicious.Located inside the Timeout market on the upper level, big open space for seating if u can find it , bar near by.Pizza's are served quick & pipping hot, price wise not too bad for a fresh brick oven pie."
608,"BRICK OVEN PIZZA! LIMITED SUPPLY IN NYCIn NYC you can only have a brick oven pizzeria if you can prove your grandfather had one, so you can't get them anywhere!! Perfectly seasoned, it feels like the pizza you would eat in Italy! We devoured it in less than 10 minutes, it was that gooooood!!@hungryhungryhumans_"
609,This pizza is sooo good! We started off with 4 large pizzas and eventually got 6 total. I keep thinking abt this pizza and how I wish I could eat it again. Highly recommend. There wasn't one I ordered that I didn't like
610,"I struggled choosing between a 4 and 5 here.  Juliana's is a very, very good slice of pizza.  About a 4.5 star slice.For any real NYC pizza shop, you deserve to be judged on either your plain cheese slice or your margherita pizza.  I had a couple slices of the Marg here and it was VERY strong.The pizza is ultra thin.  Good crust on the bottom, right level of cook on the dough.  The sauce and cheese are both high quality and taste great.  Crucially, the proportions of crust to cheese to sauce are right in line.  One of the most common pizza sins (other than just using lesser quality ingredients) is not having the right ratio - typically too much cheese.  Juliana's gets it right.I'd go back for a slice here any time I'm in the neighborhood."
611,I ordered the Margarita and the number 4 pizza with a carafe of Sangria. The pizza is decent but nothing to write home about. If you were in the area it's OK but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. Most of the pizza is kind of bland and lacks flavor. They could use some garlic or some kind of salt. I've also had the sangria and it was pretty awful; I could not drink it. I try to give it back but after they took the carafe away they told me they were gonna charge me anyway. So I gotta add bad customer service to it as well.
612,"alright out of towners--if you were like me and are on a massive internet hunt to find the best new york pizza slice to grab on your trip, look no further! after spending days scouring hundreds of reddit threads and yelp reviews, i decided on juliana's to completely base our judgement on whether or not nyc pizza truly lives up to the hype. and now i am here to tell you that our experience here truly surpassed all my expectations!!!we shared a pizza that was half margarita half white, and it was DELICIOUS!!!! so perfectly thin and crispy with the perfect amount of grease and savory flavor. the only thing is that a lot of the magic disappears when the pizza cools down and gets soft :/ i recommend minimizing conversation to maximize crispy perfection. this cozy little spot was only a short walk away from brooklyn bridge park, but it looked quite packed and had a long line at the front even though it was only 6. luckily, we didn't have to wait at all, probably since it was just the two of us. make sure to plan ahead for big parties, but take comfort in the fact that the service was still timely and was just an overall nice experience :) we unfortunately did not get to try other new york pizza spots to determine if it truly is the best in the city, but we are quite big pizza enthusiasts and would easily put juliana's at the top of all the pizzas we've had. highly recommend!!!!"
613,"Juliana's is the Patsy Grimaldi pizza place.  Grimaldi's was but is a different owner.  The REAL Grimaldi's is this restaurant, Juliana's.Red checked tablecloths and friendly service are there to greet you.  The pizza is AMAZING.  Thin, crispy crust that the perfect chew.  Freshest toppings and generous portions.  The cheese is delicious.  The sauce is simply perfection.  The pepperoni is so amazing and the garlic is abundant.  They also offer up a white pizza that is wonderful.  You might have to wait for a table, but it's well worth it.  Just do it."
614,"We got a medium pizza and a salad to share among 3 girls, plenty to go around! The dough was amazing. Our server is friendly. Great experience!"
615,Great place for pizza. 4 stars for the perfectly thin crust and casual vibes of the place. Although it felt a tad too crowded. I'm still not very comfortable being in crowded places. I wish there were more space between tables.
616,"I found myself at Juliana's in the midst of a little romantic getaway. I'm not from NYC but my lady is. She knew this was the spot to go for pizza in Dumbo so I was naturally excited. Maybe a bit dehydrated. Anyway when we arrived we were seated pretty much immediately (it was a Wednesday afternoon, I think) which was great cuz we were starving. Our server was this super smooth cat - he was super attentive, but never hovering. When we would need a bit more time to look at the menu he'd walk off like he'd never asked us anything. When we had a question, he'd be right there to answer in stride. It was absurdly smooth. We got a medium No. 6 and two beers. The beers were served promptly and the pizza came out fast. No. 6 has Guacamole and when the pizza comes out it looks like a white pizza w little green poops on it. I was floored. Extremely hungry, maybe a little tipsy from the beer and an empty stomach, I had this wave of confusion. Is this disgusting or delicious? I had to find out. For each slice, I used a knife to flatten out the guacamole poops to get a nice even distribution of Guac across the slice. The creaminess of the guac and cheese combo with little bursts of cilantro and grilled chicken made for a whirlwind of an experience. Was I flying through the air? Or diving into the depths of the most delicious sewer the world may ever know? The light beer complemented the pizza phenomenally providing a refreshing wave for each salty and creamy bite. Overall this was a top notch experience. I'd give the place five stars, but the little green poops just took me on too much of an emotional roller coaster. Until next time Juliana's. Until next time."
617,"Best pizza I had while in NYC and we ate a lot of pizza!! Tbh best pizza I've ever had! I love mushroom pizza so we just went with classic margarita added mushrooms!! The pizza was soo good, there was none left over! Service was good and friendly. Recommend to anyone visiting the city."
618,Best pizza in Brooklyn.The original Grimaldis.Great location.Great options.Great people.
619,"A LOT of hype coming from this place. Looks like there is a whole backstory of how this place started but I won't get into it. They do have a connection to Grimaldi's and I can tell since both pizza's are similar. Fyi, they do serve alcohol so that is a positive. We ordered the margherita, marinara pizza, and a specialty pie. The marinara pie was very bland. The sauce needed salt bad!  It is hard to do a marinara pizza well since it is very simple but they missed here.  The margherita is pretty good. The crust is light and crunchy at the same time. Specialty pie #1 was average as well. The toppings didn't complinent the pizza. The crust is the star of the show here so they have that going for them.  It is small place with no reservations so get here early! Grimaldi's is next door but I rate Juliana's a touch higher. This may have been an even lower score because they cannot justify charging $30+ for pizza. It is ridiculous but I let it slide.  I'm not dying to come back but if I did I probably wouldn't be mad."
620,Best steakhouse in NYC hands down! Porterhouse comes out on a sizzling hot plate. The apps and sides are amazing. The ambiance is great! Service is on point. Highly recommend.
621,"While planning our East Coast honeymoon with my husband, last September. I came across this place through a GroupOn I purchased which was a PreFix dinner with two appetizers, two entrees and sides with dessert. This was a perfect thing to use on our last day in NY. Which was really pleasant indeed.The restaurant had a comfort of home feel too it when you walk in. To our surprise the man who greeted us and was tending to the bar was actually the owner of the place.This inside and upstairs aesthetic took you to a place out of a movie filmed in NY. The set up was pretty nice with all the red interiors.  You would also tell this was a family run business because we were graced with the presence of all the generations of family running the show all together which can be also documented with all the family photos decorating the walls of the main floor.The food that was brought out was wonderful, very tasteful and well cooked.  It was especially nice to be services to the owner who was kind enough to take our pictures. We hope to visit this place again and try other dishes offered."
622,"Cozy, comfy, iconic and the staff were accommodating and friendly. Bathrooms were clean. The steak was okay. Sides were great. And dessert was pretty good. The oysters were pretty great."
623,"- Food: please go to another steakhouse. You can get meaningfully better quality steak a similar prices at one of the better known places (try Wolfgang's or Luger). The porterhouse we got was chewy and fatty. The sides were far too salty, and the mac and cheese was watery and looked like it came out of a Kraft box. They did give us free dessert as we clearly looked displeased, but this was not great either - Hersheys syrup on what tastes like factory made cheesecake.- Drinks: were strong, nothing mind blowing.- Service: was fairly slow."
624,"Let's start with the waitstaff, they were really friendly and great service, kudos to them.We ordered the prime ribeye and a filet mignon. Steaks quality themselves were fresh and decent but they were a bit too salty for us. The creamed spinach was really good and the cocktails were decent as well."
625,"I go to NYC steakhouses 1-2 times a year, always in the winter, and it's such a fun experience that I recommend you add this tradition to your seasonal calendar as well.This year's steakhouse pick was Club A. They had their wood-burning fireplace roaring in the Lobby, which set the vibe. I love starting my steakhouse nights with a crabcake, and Club A's variety comes with a remoulade and basic mixed greens salad. The crabcake was phenomenal - large chunks of crabmeat, and very little filler. The remoulade was rich and mustardy. The mixed greens salad dressing seemed to be all oil - I wanted some vinegar or other acidic element there. The salad doesn't need to be an afterthought.I ordered the filet mignon, which was perfectly cooked with a seared umami bomb crust, and had been generously rubbed with salt. The inside was juicy and pink, a perfect specimen of medium-rare. I choice the poivre sauce, and ladled restrained spoonfuls on to the delicious beef to avoid overpowering it. The poivre sauce had herbaceous notes of rosemary, and I loved dipping the homemade French fries we had also ordered into the poivre sauce. We also chose the creamed spinach, which was delicious.Service was great, and they even gave us a complimentary dessert plate! With a full slice of cheesecake!The only complaint, aside from the side salad dressing, would be the variety of the ""by the glass"" section of the wine list. I was considering a celebratory champagne, but the only bubbles by the glass was prosecco, which I typically equate with bottomless mimosa brunches. There were 4 great options of Cab, but no Bordeaux. The only Chardonnay available was from California, which is a very specific taste and can sometimes be polarizing (for some - I loved it).I've enjoyed steakhouse dinners at DelFrisco's, Keen's, and Quality Meats previously. I think the food is the best at DelFrisco's, but I'd rather go to Club A or Keen's for that classic NYC steakhouse atmosphere."
626,"I've always wanted to try Club A, and was finally able to do so on Valentine's Day. We were seated upstairs and really appreciated the heart-shaped balloons on the ceiling and also enjoyed the live music throughout our meal. My only criticism was my filet mignon was a little bland, but the steak itself was cooked perfectly. The service was impeccable. Everyone was extremely friendly and attentive. We didn't feel rushed at all. Also, the lighting in this restaurant is perfect for pictures!"
627,"I dunno fellow Yelpers.  This one dropped the ball for us.  Really great waitstaff, so nothing against them, but the rest was just ok.  Ordinarily I would give the rating a 3 star, but when I have limited time in The City, I don't want to have a wasted meal.  With so many excellent steakhouses in the area, I'm surprised for the love for Club A. We ordered off the restaurant week menu.  I got the Caesar salad, was supposed to have anchovies, but alas there were none.  Hubs got the bacon which was good but I give the nod to Peter Luger's. I got the hangar steak, which was cooked medium as requested but my husband's filet, also requested medium came back cooked pretty well throughout. Our sides were the creamed spinach (really good! I liked the seasoning of nutmeg!) but the Mac and cheese tasted watery and powdery.  My husband compared it to bad overcooked Kraft, and I had to agree. Finally we each got desserts- hubs got the tiramisu, really good and I got the profiterole- the mousse was great but the pastry puff itself seemed dry, stale even.  If you do try this place out, request to sit upstairs, the ambiance is way nicer with the trees lit up in the windows on both sides as opposed to downstairs."
628,I'm so glad we found this restaurant. The filet mignon was top notch. Everything we had tonight was amazing. Will definitely come back.
629,"AMAZINGGGG STEAKHOUSE!!!!!!!OKK, firstly a huge shoutout to my amazing boyfriend for surprising me here for our anniversary! Though I WAS (keyword was) the last person to ever want to go to a steakhouse because I wasn't a huge fan of steak prior to coming here, my boyfriend thought this would change my mind and indeed he was RIGHT! Although I was very skeptical and very apprehensive of me liking steak and how expensive this place was, I can honestly say this place has changed my mind on steak. The experience of having live jazz music, the exceptional service, THE STEAK, THE SIDES, THE DESSERT, EVERYTHING was hands down beyond PERFECTION! My boyfriend and I went with the Porterhouse for 2 and it was just *CHEFS KISS*... Club A was absolutely the best restaurant to go to for our anniversary dinner! I will most definitely be coming back with my boyfriend and family in the near future and would  recommend to everyone, a 10000/5 rating for me! Thank you Club A for the amazing service!!!"
630,"Absolutely one of the best steak houses in NYC! Great food, Great ambiance and a Great family like team! Thank you for another amazing dining experience Club A!"
631,"Phenomenal steakhouse! Everything from walking in with our interaction with the hostess to leaving with a nice full belly, my visit here was near perfect. My friends and I came here because it was restaurant week and we saw how many reviews this steak house had and wanted to try it out. We ordered the salmon and the filet mignon from the restaurant week menu and we ordered the prime porterhouse steak for 2 as well. The restaurant week menu is definitely worth it- an appetizer, entree, side AND desert for 39! The portions were big and the Mac and cheese was an amazing side. The porterhouse steak was delicious as well- I would give it an 8/10 overall for presentation as well as taste. The cocktails were very good as well- I ordered the staycation with tequila and and a hint of pineapple and it went well with our food options. At the end of our visit, the waiter came out with a special desert for us because my friend just graduated with her masters- on the house. It was a combination of Tiramisu, cheesecake and a crème puff and it was a perfect way to end our meal. The waitress even took a picture of us near the end of our visit and gave it to us as a souvenir for us to keep- very thoughtful. Only bad thing about our visit was the bathroom was a bit gross- it smelled and it wasn't very clean for a top notch steakhouse. Other than that I would highly recommend this place and can't want to come back."
632,"Oh I loved my visit to this restaurant!!! The food was amazing the waiters, the host, every one was so kind and welcoming it felt like I was a part of their little family. For a steakhouse with such a rich history you would expect everyone to be so standoffish or unwelcoming but I was pleasantly surprised at how nice and welcoming the staff was. I had the branzino with creamed spinach and it was delicious my mom had the mushroom ravioli, (I know I know how can you go to a steakhouse and not get steak? but we have been on a steak kick for the last month  too much red meat) Although we weren't celebrating anything Our waiter was still nice enough to have the kitchen staff write this adorable message on our dessert plate. Def going again !"
633,"This restaurant was delicious. I forgot to take pictures but I got the Caesar Salad and thick cut back as appetizers. The salad definitely had an anchovy taste which I'm not very fond of but the salad was very good. I don't think I would get it again but good, nonetheless. The bacon was 10/10. It was perfectly cooked and the flavor was amazing. We both got steaks and they were perfectly cooked. They both had lots of flavor. Price is about the same as any steakhouse. I would definitely come back again."
634,"I have had this restaurant bookmarked for a very long time and chose to come here tonight after a long day of shooting. This has to be the most impeccable service I've ever received from a restaurant! The owner was fantastic and accommodating and my waiter was super sweet and engaging. I had a fantastic time and I definitely want to bring my family and friends here. Not to mention, their playlist is awesome. They'll be giving you 70s and 80s classics -- exactly my style! I get sensitive when I drink so when I'll Be Around by The Spinners started playing, I almost cried but kept it together so my lashes wouldn't fall off. Oh, and the food ain't too bad I had a great dinner (by myself), and that's all thanks to Bruno and Nicholas (forgive me if his name is misspelled!)So happy that not only could I check this off my list but it was totally worth the wait! I absolutely recommended!"
635,Had a really good experience dining here on my birthday! I ordered the seared salmon and Mac n cheese and they were both great!
636,Very good food and service also the prices are good too.I been here a lot of times never disappointed.And always they offer us a plate with a dessert combination.
637,This is a late review but I came here  a few months ago to celebrate an anniversary.  To start off the staff is very professional and the Owner is very nice as informed us how long he has been in business. We ordered a bottle of wine two entrees and side dishes. The lamb chops wasn't the best as it was not flavorful but it everything else was good. I would definitely come back to try other things off the menu. The ambiance is also nice.
638,Very nice steak and customer service is top notch. The owner and the restaurant will touch your hearts with their service and steak. Highly recommend to visit this restaurant!
639,"I heard about this restaurant when I googled some of the steakhouses in the city in case we want to try a different steakhouse for the future. The future is here. After coming back from celebrating my birthday in Florida, I suggested to Hubby that this place would be the one to celebrate his birthday. Our birthdays are a week apart, so coming here is also to please me and my wish to try the restaurant. I called to make a reservation, and I thought maybe I could use a Groupon, which we don't usually do, but when you Google the steakhouse, the Groupon promotion pops up. That's how I know they have an offer. I mentioned to the person who took the reservation that I wanted to use Groupon. However, we decided not to use it for the big day, will use it next time. They had a lovely hostess. She's delightful and professional. She escorted me upstairs to the table by the window while Hubby parked the car. The ambiance imitates the 1960s backdrop, classic looks. We had Diego as our waiter for the night. It looked like he was the only waiter on the floor with the help of a busboy. He did a great job. We started our dinner with a beet salad. OK, please don't order this because this is not their specialty. Too much dressing, which was a bit acidic, didn't do well with the beet salad. That's ok. It's a steakhouse. Let's see how they do it in this department. I would try a Caesar salad next time. We ordered the porterhouse steak for two and a side order of broccoli. The steak came out perfect, exactly as we requested. It was served with their homemade fantastic steak sauce! Must-try! The steak juice was enjoyable too. I approved whatever that the Chef used to marinade! Of course, we didn't finish the steak for two, no matter how hungry we were. We like small bites at night. We like leftovers!After finishing our dinner, the lovely hostess came up to us with a camera and said she would like to take our photo since we're celebrating Hubby's birthday. So we posed for the camera. After all that, we were attacked by some slices of birthday cake! Then the Manager/Owner, Bruno, came up to us and presented a lovely birthday card, and inside was a nice print of our birthday pose. Awesome birthday adventure! Worth it! Thank you, the management and staff, for taking good care of us and making Hubby's birthday the most memorable one. I definitely will return to try more great food on the menu. Excellent food and service and recommended!"
640,Been to many famous steakhouses in NYC and this place is worth a visit. Steak stayed soft even after it got a little cold. Definitely pair up with red wine to appreciate the meat taste~~
641,"I'm SO happy to have dinner here tonight. My friend had to cancel but I kept the reservation. My greeting was friendly and kind. I was given a great table in the lower dining room in a comfortable ambiance surrounded by photos of former patrons. FYI, even though my friend canceled on me I decided to go solo. So happy I did. My dinner was: Caesar Salad, Filet (medium and came out perfect), MacCheese (there go the Cals) and dessert of tiramisu (perfect). I'm a traditionalist and I give this establishment 5 stars:  ambiance, service, food quality and music (60's and earlier with some Frankie). I'll be back!!  Go!  I hope you enjoy as much as I have. Peace."
642,"What a wonderful time we had at this place!!Came to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday we had a bottle of wine, Cesar salad, thick bacon ( oh my goodness what a delicious treat) fillet mignon and tiramisu everything was delicious, the service was impeccable!The brought a candle with the dessert and took a picture of us, the owner came after we a post card that had out picture and signed it, thought was a great gesture.Highly recommend this place you'll have a great dinner and a fantastic time.Thank you Bruno for making us feel like home, we are definitely coming back!"
643,"For a NYC steakhouse, Club A Steakhouse is pretty good. The service is impeccable. The steak itself is solid, as are the typical sides. Pricing is also comparable to other steakhouses. Overall, a good experience."
644,"Club A Steakhouse transported my hunny and I to an elite only Birthday Dinner Festivus. From the moment we walked in we were whisked away to the upper level which looked like a VIP section for an exclusive club. The ambiance and inviting decor left me wanting more.Bruno, the owner is quite an amazing human being. He treated us like family and ensured that we had a spectacular time. Every single person we encountered was absolutely wonderful and very gracious, especially our server whose name escapes me.We started off with drinks which consisted of the Un-Mu-Sual Times and a Sazerac. I wasn't a fan of the Un-Mu-Sual Times so I sent it back for Tito's with Pineapple Juice. My hunny enjoyed his Sazerac. For our app we went with the Club A Crabcake which was an absolute hit. The crabmeat was tender and the remoulade made for a nice dressing when paired with the field greens. For dinner we had the Prime Porterhouse For Two cooked medium, Creamed Spinach, as well as the Mac & Cheese. Everything and I mean everything about our meal was divine. I was amazed at the tenderness and bursting flavors my palate was graced with after each bite. The creamed spinach was some of the best I've ever tasted. I was a tad weary about the nutmeg but it complemented the side dish so well. The Mac & cheese was also one for the books. The house blend and breadcrumbs stole the show. As greedy as I am my only gripe is that I wish the sides were bigger. I appreciate Bruno and our waiter making sure we were taken care of and wanted for nothing throughout our dining experience. It's the little touches that woos me. The graciousness we experienced here was enough for me to rate this place 5 stars. Club A Steakhouse is a true gem. I was blessed with a complimentary dessert trio of  Cheesecake, Tiramisu, and I believe what were Cream Puffs.  It was delicious and we left nothing back except for the cream puffs. We weren't a huge fan of the oil aftertaste. A huge thank you to Bruno and his lovely team who catered to my every need and honored us with a complimentary picture. I had an amazing birthday with my love while enjoying the delicious food and drinks. I couldn't have asked for a better evening. Club A Steakhouse is on my ""must return"" list."
645,"""Wow a 4.5 star steakhouse with dry aged porterhouse like Peter Luger?!""Read this to save yourself from disappointment. After having Luger, Wolfgang's, Rocco, Gallagher's, Del Frisco, Benjamin, Keen's, etc., these are my thoughts:Negroni: 3/5 - correct ingredients at the very least, but watered downBacon: 3.5/5 - nothing special, but does the job. You don't get that melt in your mouth seared fat feeling like other placesPorterhouse (medium rare): 2/5 - did not even taste dry aged, didn't have that ""funk."" Came medium. A lot of cartilage/chew. Very small portion compared to the usual. Creamed spinach: 1/5 - it was watered down, no garlic flavor, not sure where the cream wentMac and cheese: 2/5 - literally white cheddar Kraft. Only reason it's not a 1/5 is because I kinda like Kraft hahahService was slow. This is a steakhouse for people who are visiting NYC. Save yourself the money, but if you end up going and realizing I was right, give me a like"
646,"I'd have to say that I had a wonderful experience here. The owner, staff servers and hosts were all very accommodating and attentive. I was invited with open arms as a solo diner. Sometimes I don't get that same treatment from where I am from in San Francisco, CA. It's unfortunate because a business should never judge a solo diner. I've had the following suggestions: the rib eye, the Moscow mule, the asparagus, the mashed potatoes, the oysters, nikka whiskey, and a glass of cabernet from mondavi. The staff were kind enough to allow me to taste a few different steak sauces and even surprised me with a nice dessert of tiramisu. It just so happens that it's my favorite. I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for quality food, great and attentive service as well as a quiet and intimate atmosphere. I didn't wanted a private dinner and it was exactly what I recieved. I will surely be back! This will easily be my usual spot for great American steak! Thanks again for such great hospitality! I will see you all again soon."
647,"Came here with a group of 4 for a double date and were promptly seated upstairs after having our vaccination cards checked (which I appreciated since so many restaurants fail to do so!). The dining room is dark and cozy and does not feel crammed. Good spot for a date. We ordered the oysters, shrimp cocktail, Caesar salad, filet mignons, and side of creamed spinach, Mac and cheese and asparagus. Portions were on the slightly smaller side relative to what I'm used to at other steakhouses but overall was plenty of food and everything tasted great. My steak was perfectly cooked. They don't have a dessert menu so if you order it you'll get a trio of tiramisu, profiteroles, and chocolate cake (I liked not having to make a decision). The service was seamless as well even though it seemed like the waiter was covering a bunch of tables."
648,"I really liked this restaurant. When you walk in it has such an old fashioned classy feel. Love the jazz music they play.  I appreciate the hospitality. The owner was very accommodating and waiters very attentive. Now to the good part the Porter house steak cooked medium rare was absolutely delicious. Tender, buttery, sizzling off the plate, and juicy!! The sides we ordered were the baked potato with sour cream and creamed spinach. Loved the baked potato the skin was so crispy and yummy!! The creamed spinach was interesting. At first you wonder if you like it or not but keep eating it and then it grows on you as time goes on. Let me just say don't eat it by itself but with the steak it's a great combination. The dessert we got was tiramisu, carrot cake, zeppole combination. The zeppole absolutely delicious so soft!!! Everything was so yummy! Great selection of wines as well. Go and experience this place you won't be disappointed!"
649,"Great family owned steakhouse!  Amazing service, food, and drinks! Local, loving environment"
650,I almost never review places unless they're really good or really bad. Visiting NYC for the weekend from Seattle and was asking for recommendations for steakhouses and of course everyone says Peter Luger. Tried them but they wanted to seat us at an ungodly hour. researched and stumped upon Club A. By far. One of my favorite dinner experiences in my life. Was celebrating an anniversary of 4 years and they truly made it special. I am positive the A in Club A stands for amazing. Bruno (owner) walked to our table and chatted with us and really made our time special.I highly recommend the crab cake/filet/Mac cheese.I don't know if this review can ever describe how amazing our time was at Club A. They went above and beyond any restaurant experience in my life. Truly a family friendly experience.
651,"Reading through the other reviews, I have no clue what restaurant they're referring to. I'll keep this one short, but DO NOT get the Groupon! My husband and I went tonight with a Groupon we were given as a wedding gift, had never been here before...In general, everyone around us has seemed to be happy/ satisfied with their food, but we simply were not. The appetizers were disgusting: salad was dry with no dressing and lettuce was brown; bacon looked kind of like it came out of a can and was served with a mound of ketchup.For the mains, steak was decent, which is the only reason this is 2/5, but the French fries and Mac n cheese we ordered were simply not edible. French fries were from a bag at the grocery store and Mac n cheese was caked in butter, no cheese. Desserts were subpar at best, tiramisu wasn't made correctly and was layers of white cake, not traditionally soaked cookies (came off very dry). Profiteroles we're also small (quarter sized) abs super dry.The experience comes with wine, but CVS quality wine. For $5.50, increase the quality of food and forget the wine. Also, we TRIED to order another bottle and were told no, it comes with this wine? Weird..Skip the Groupon, maybe come without it? Hard to think you'd choose this place with all the fantastic steakhouses in the city.Also-- very bad smell, almost sour milk smelling, they should really fix that!"
652,"This was  literally the best steak I've ever had in my life here last night.All the staff were amazing, they even took a picture of us which the owner hand signed.Couldn't possibly recommend more"
653,"Where to start?  Multiple visits, gets better each time.  Cozy, romantic, comfortable.  Amazing staff and service.  Delicious food.  Impressive wine list.  Skip the big names and come here.  Bruno and his staff truly make you feel like family."
654,"Really enjoyed my meal at Club A!Their Covid outdoor dining setup is super cute and the staff was great. The bacon appetizer was delicious. I also had the prime ribeye (enough for two people to share), a side of creamed spinach, and a side of mac n cheese. The steak was cooked perfectly and the sides were good as well. The real star is the complementary dessert. Honestly it's worth coming just for that. It's a HUGE portion and you get tiramisu, chocolate cake, chocolate mousse, and profiteroles and MY GOODNESS was is delicious."
655,We've been here a few times for work dinners. I'd recommend it if you are looking for a steakhouse in the area.
656,Great food great steaks good atmosphere! Good for dates and large parties!! They have live jazz!
657,"This was a cool place. Live band downstairs. Steak was good. Not the best but very good none the less. Wine by the glass was good, service was excellent. The bacon was a real treat. The potatoes were watery. Overall would love to return next time were here."
658,"Came to visit New York all the way from San Francisco,Ca and was looking for somewhere to eat and found alot of good reviews for this restaurant so decided to give it a try. 1st the restaurant was really nice everyone was very nice. The food was great. They even gave us a picture with a thank you card and at the end they gave us dessert on the house. That was a plus also. The environment inside the restaurant was really nice. Definitely will be back when I come to visit New York again."
659,"We came here because the good reviews and they were 100% true. First the location is very good; then the place is beautiful. We came on a Saturday night and they had a live music trio downstairs. The service was excellent. Our waiter was always friendly and attentive without being overbearing. The food was great. My favorites were the Bacon, the Hanger Steak and the Creamy Spinach. The owner Mr. Marco had the nice detail of asking everyone how everything was doing. We really didn't want to leave and for sure we will be back."
660,"This restaurant is pretty big and fits a great amount of people. I was surprised to see that majority of the people that dined here were tourists and we were lucky enough to sit in the last few tables. This restaurant only accepts cash and they have an ATM machine right at the front of the entrance. I wouldn't say that this place was amazing and one of my top goto places for soup dumplings but it is pretty decent here. The fried dumplings are great and my friend who does not like fried dumplings actually really enjoyed the ones from here. The soup dumplings had a good amount of soup in them. The beef fried rice was pretty good as well and there was a good portion of meat inside. They do include about a 18% service charge in your bill and all the waiters are extrmely patient and attentive. There are many different ways to eat soup dumplings for those that are not too sure how to eat them and are reading my review. First off, it is really hot once you lift the lid off of the bamboo steamer. Use the tongs that they give you or your chopsticks and grab the very tip of the soup dumpling that sticks out the most. Then place is onto the spoon.1. You can just eat it as a whole but will most likely burn yourself if you do not wait for it to cool off. 2. Take a bit off the tip of the dumpling and you will see that inside there's a ball of meat and soup surrounding it. (At this point you can either add a spoonful of the sauce that they provide, which usually consists of soy sauce/vinegar/ginger, inside the dumpling or not have sauce at all) Wait for it to cool off and then eat as a whole or you could drink the soup first then eat it. 3. Another way is taking a bite of the tip of the dumpling and pour the soup out onto the spoon.There are many different other ways to eat a soup dumpling but just make sure to let it cook off a bit because you will get burned. I've made many mistakes in the past hahaha."
661,"Everyone already knows why you would go to Joe's Shanghai and if you don't already know, it's for the Xiao Long Bao (Soup Dumplings). The traditional pork soup dumplings are always high on the list for many that frequent this location. Our party got in early on a Saturday and was able to secure a table relatively easily. We got there 15 minutes before the restaurant opened and were the first in line. Being the first there, we were seated in snugly near the corner of the restaurant. Pork Meat Soup Dumplings - The quintessential Xiao Long Bao. The must order item here at the restaurant and it did not disappoint at all. The wrapper was thin, but not so thin that it broke when you picked it up (Mind you, you'll still need to be gentle). I'm somewhat of a barbarian and enjoy shoveling food into my mouth with zeal. This is a different story... be a little more subtle. Take your time... enjoy the moment and sip the inner soup. Take a nibble here... or there... before you ultimately take the whole dumpling into your mouth. Savor the moment. Crab Meat with Pork Meat Soup Dumplings - This item sits on top of the Pork Meat Soup Dumplings on Joe's menu. It costs $2 more for a single order. If you're a fan of real crab or that flavor, you'll probably like it. I personally wasn't a huge fan when I compared it to the original Pork Meat only Dumplings. Shanghai Sauteed Flat Noode (Thick Noodle) - I feel like this item gets overlooked a lot by many people, but this item is a must order. Like a ""Kill on Sight Order"", you MUST order this when you dine at Joe's Shanghai. This was one of the best parts of the meal. The noodles had a fantastic chew to them and was aromatic yet not overpowering. I thoroughly enjoyed the vegetables and pork of the noodles, but the blend of soy sauce and sesame oil really shined in the dish. Everything about this was very comforting. Joe's Shanghai is still cash only, and they have an ATM at the entrance of the restaurant. Service here was just ok. Despite being first in the restaurant and ready to order, it took them a bit of time to come by and take our order. A few other tables were able to order ahead of us and served their food before they came to help us. Aside from the initial service, everything else was great."
662,"I can sit here and give an account of all the dishes I ate here or I can just tell you why you're really here. The food isn't superb. It's safe. It's one of the more recently and intricately decorated restaurants in Chinatown that you would hope that other spots would follow suit because we all want a nice and shiny Chinatown. This restaurant is a great choice for both locals AND tourists alike. It's where when the Asian guy starts dating a white girl, to bring her to to ease in the hyper niche stuff. It's where all the mid-west tourist families that want to sample soup dumplings for the first time and not have their ungrateful bratty kids not scream for CHICKEN NUGGEEEETS. And when they do, you can order them the General Tso's chicken and wonder if you really love them and then come to the conclusion that you do, regardless of how uncultured they are.I think the portions are small for the price and I think they can get away with it because where else are you going to go for this level of ethnic standardization in Chinatown?... HUH? The soup dumplings are unfortunately OK. This is heartbreaking news as this is what blew up the restaurant. I think it's because they have to constantly crank them out. Victims of their own success?I'd like to further add that don't get the pan fried noodles. It's my favorite dish to get at Cantonese restaurants but they just do it so differently that I wouldn't want that to be the impression to you (yes you, the white girl who just started dating that handsome Asian guy).And I'd come here again! Because I forgot to mention, it's great for groups. Tony the Tiger would approve. Asians call it ""Family Style"" but in the business industry they call it ""Tourism"", as they lick their lips. Come to think of it, I noticed they didn't have the spinning table wheel that's usually meant to help share. Is Family Style dying?"
663,"The wait is insane. Coming on a Thursday at 4pm, I waited nearly 40 minutes. It was well worth it. Menu is straight forward and although the food is pricey, you get for what you pay for here. Service is great. Bathrooms are clean. Please make sure you have your vaccination card and ID ready (or use the NYC COVID safe app). The party before us waited 40 mins and was turned away when their number got called up since they didn't have their vaccine."
664,We came at 6:00 PM and had to wait an hour to be seated. The crab and pork soup dumplings are a must get. As you bite into the dumplings a rich soup broth bursts in your mouth. We also got the sesame chicken and off the menu broccoli in garlic sauce. Both sauces were very thick and rich so I don't recommend getting both and would suggest to get some sides of rice as a pallet cleanser * You don't come here for the nice atmosphere or to have a long drawn out dinner. We were in an out in 35 minutes (yes even after ordering and eating all that food). The servers hover around you and the second you are done with the dish they grab the plate before you can put the serving spoon down. Had to knock them to 4 stars because of how uncomfortable the 5 servers standing over your shoulder felt.
665,"First things first: This establishment is CASH ONLY so make your way to the ATM before arriving. People have been raving about Joe's Shanghai so  made me way too Chinatown to try out their soup dumplings. This is a pretty popular place but luckily when I came in a weekday afternoon we were seated promptly. We order fried potstickers, crab soup dumplings and beef soup dumplings. Their potions are huge so we definitely had to take a box to go.The soup dumplings were good and I appreciated their large side but I actually enjoyed their fried potstickers more. Since it received a lot of hype from people I had higher expectations but it was still decent. I would definitely come back for potstickers and to try other dishes."
666,Joe's Shanghai is a great soup dumpling destination option in Manhattan. I believe the food item pricing is affordable and not overpriced. The menu is clear with a large variety of options to choose from. I visited with a group of 5 and we ordered several items to share around the table. The portions are pretty large and definitely shareable. We ordered the following: Crab Meat with Pork Meat Soup Dumplings (8): $9.95Pork Meat Soup Dumplings (8): $7.95Pork Fried Dumplings (8): $5.95Broccoli in Garlic Sauce Fried Rice (Pork): $13.25 Fried Rice (Vegetable): $13.25This restaurant does not accept reservations. It's a first come first serve setup with a number system once you're on the list. The staff have been kind and gracious each time I visited this location. They move quick because this place is so busy. I would suggest having an idea of what to order ahead of time (after all you've probably waited in line for quite some time). NOTE: THIS RESTAURANT DOES NOT ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS. CASH ONLY.
667,"Was recommended to this place when I asked friends about dumplings/dim sum type food. They accept cash only!! 18% tip is added to every tabThis place does offer cart style dim sum but a wide array of Chinese food. Quick and easy service. We got seated right away for two in the afternoon. Our table and seat was not wiped down however so there were stray noodles around when we were seated. We got the pork soup dumplings which were nice and juicy. None had popped on the way to the table and had a lot of soup in them. They taste best hot so I was happy to have that experience as they became less appetizing as the meal went by. The soup was pretty good but I have had better soup dumplings. You get 8 for about $8. We also got the gumsub pan fried noodles for about $17 and the portion was generous. Loved the mixed seafood and noodles but the sauce was on the salty side which was inevitable looking at how dark brown the sauce was.Overall, it was a tasty experience but had some hiccups between table cleanliness and salty flavor."
668,"The best soup dumplings in NYC, and according to my xiao long bao connoisseur fiancé, some of the best in the world (and we have been to Shanghai). Joe's has been a Chinatown institution since 1995, and has recently moved to a larger space just a few blocks from the original location. The new restaurant is sparkling clean and modern. Gone are the old communal tables, replaced with new pandemic friendly seating. Be prepared to wait for a table. Even with the increased square footage, the wait was a little under one hour. At noon, on a Monday. Joe's does not make a meatless version of their famous XLB, but there are plenty of delicious vegetarian options on the menu. You must try the Shredded Turnip Shortcakes. Delicate, flakey pastry encapsulates creamy roasted turnip. The Shanghai Fried Bean Curd is a unique cold dish, featuring deeply savory wheat gluten. You also cannot go wrong with their Vegetable Fried Rice.They accept cash only. There is a Chase ATM just a few blocks away on Mott below Canal. An absolute must-try restaurant."
669,"Joe Shanghai is a NY classic and experience. We came here for an early dinner around 6pm on a Saturday. We waiting about 5 minutes for a table for two. We were vaccine checked and escorted to our table. Our waiter and server were both prompt and friendly. We were asked if we wanted to start with their famous pork or pork and crab soup dumplings. Over course we said ""yes"" and an order was placed. We also ordered scallion pancakes, shredded beef with jalapeño soup and a tofu & pork dish. Everything was serviced fresh and hot as it was ready. We didn't feel rushed but they move at a quick pace. After we were finished with our main courses we actually ordered one more order of soup dumplings because they are THAT good. They are cash only and include an 18% tip. No complaints there. They are upfront about it.Recommend if you're in the area!"
670,"THE best soup dumplings EVER. I moved from NYC 3 years and every time I go back I have to stop by Joe's Shanghai and get (2) orders of the soup dumplings - one of the Crab Meat and one of the Pork - and the Pan Fried Crispy Noodles with veggies. Always consistent, always delicious. The soup dumpling's broth is perfection, packed with all the flavors you want. It never disappoints. A must if you're in NYC!!!"
671,"CASH ONLY! They have ATMs on site if needed.I came with four friends for a Sunday evening dinner. You have to have the whole party there to get seated, and they'll give you a ticket number and ask for contact information.Food: We ordered the crispy shrimp pan fried noodles, pan fried dumplings, scallion pancakes, beef and broccoli, pork soup dumplings, and crab and pork soup dumplings. The soup dumplings were really good, I usually prefer crab soup dumplings, but I liked the pork soup dumplings here better (but both were very good!). The scallion pancakes and pan fried pork dumplings were also very yummy and cooked well with a nice crisp on the outside. The beef and broccoli was also nice and flavorful, and the beef was tender, but I did expect a bigger portion than what we got. The pan fried noodles were okay, there wasn't a ton of flavor and the water chestnuts and corn had a strong canned flavor. I probably would order everything again except for the pan fried noodles. Service: This place was really busy, but we still got our food in a timely manner. I think they could make improvements to their waiting area and process since it's a small area by the doorway and lots of people just huddle around and there's no clear line. A woman cut in front of us when we were waiting at the front by the host table, so that was a bit annoying since there wasn't a very organized system or line."
672,"I found myself exploring China Town for the first time and decided to pop into Joe's Shanghai.There was a wait, but since I was a part of 1, it took about 15 minutes for me to be seated.I ordered the house glazed crispy chicken which was a large portion, and I also ordered the wonton soup which was a GINORMOUS PORTION.Being solo, I finished about 1/2 of the chicken and maybe 1/4 of the wonton soup.I can't tell you what all is in that glaze for the chicken, but it is SO flavorful. Not so rich that it's overpowering, but just the right balance of sweet/savory. There were plenty of veggies with it too - that's a bonus to me. The breading was indeed crispy, not soggy like so many breaded chicken dishes in sauce that I've had at other establishments outside China Town.The chicken was tender, and the dish was hot & freshly made.The wonton soup was everything a wonton soup should be: the dumplings were full as could be, and the broth was a great hearty flavor. No watery soup here!My only lamentation is that I wish I could have taken the rest to go, but alas I wasn't going to be able to carry it around with me for the rest of the day.Side note: This place is cash-only, so bring cash or be prepared to use the ATM in the foyer."
673,"Visited on a Thursday night for dinner and waited around 30 minutes to be seated, so it's a bit of a wait. This place is also cash only. The pork dumpling was definitely my favorite and is well-deserved as one of the most popular dishes. We also ordered the crab XLB, green beans and the flat noodles, which were nothing too special. While the pork dumpling is the star of the show, the overall experience was not worthy of the wait considering how every other entree left a lot to be desired."
674,"I don't know how long they've been relocated for but I JUST recently found it! The restaurant made such an upgrade and looks beautiful inside! Came by for dinner with my boyfriend. Waited about 10 mins. or so. They checked for ID and vax card, and was then seated. The restaurant was FULL. It was a bit difficult to get a waiters attention but other than that, the food was as good as I remembered it from the previous location, from the xiao long baos and appetizers to the entrees. Everything was delicious - XLB, scallion pancakes and sliced braised beef noodle soup. We left with bellies full and dishes emptied. Not sure if it is because of the pandemic but the gratuity was not optional, as in they posted it on the check. My boyfriend and I didn't mind but it was the first time seeing it for a party of 2."
675,"Look- I love a hype. I know it is usually overrated but I still love restaurants that are hyped up. I find them fun. I walked into Joe's solo and got seated right away (SHOCK) I have been to nyc many times and eaten many different kinds of soup dumplings but never at Joe's. FINALLY I GOT TO TRY JOE'S.I went in, got the chicken on the special list and also the soup dumps. The dumps are big. They are not soupy inside but more gravy like. While hot it was not bad, when it got room temp. It was actually kind of gross. The chicken was actually really good. Everything was on the expensive side, but like I said- I like a hype and am use to the price. I am giving one star because I really didn't like the soup dumplings... Like I would avoid them to be honest. The chicken was good but the rice was burnt! How can a Chinese place have burnt rice??? I didn't love the place. I am totally fine with bad service if that is the vibe of the place, but for these prices it is sort of not okay. Okay what really ticked me is they added an 18% service charge. I don't mind. I usually tip higher then that regardless so no big deal. I left another few dollars because that was the change I had. The treated me awful after I left the tip and even yeah ""hey!"" super meanly when I tried to leave. I turned around and asked if something was wrong? He said ""oh nothing."" Then in Chinese I heard him bitch about my tip.... I am so confused. I googled and googled to see if there was an extremely high 18% service tax in nyc and if I was suppose to tip more? I asked my nyc friends. No one understands what happened....Look- I would not skip this place because again I love a hype but the soup dumplings really aren't that good."
676,"Joe's was a lot of fun! Nothing fancy, just good hearty food in a comfortable setting. We really liked being able to chat with people at tables nearby about which dishes they liked, and recommended.Every time we passed, we could see a gathering of people, waiting for a table. We were curious and found out from other guests that they love Joe's, especially their specialty, the dumplings...in particular their Soup Dumplings!  And they were right!  We ordered lots of food, enjoyed the family atmosphere, and had a fun, delicious meal!  In fact, we went back during our stay for another round!Leave enough time to enjoy this ""uptown"" Chinatown-style experience!"
677,"I can't give five stars because I only tried one item on the menu. But for that sole item, I would give IT five stars in its own! The pork soup dumplings were SO good. You could just see the bits and pieces of pork fat in the soup. I know it may sound and look a bit disgusting but trust me, SO GOOD. The soup flavor was really porky and rich. And you get 8 hefty sized dumplings. Definitely get your money's worth compared to other places that are usually smaller in size. Will be one of my must go to's when I'm in NYC."
678,"Food was decent, service was atrocious. We were seated around 8:45pm, didn't get our food until almost 10pm after multiple reminders, and immediately were given To-go boxes and the check. We didn't even finish half the food by the time they were rushing us out. It also took them forever to take our order as I was trying to get there attention, despite there being a bunch of people working on the floor. Organization was just horrible and it didn't seem like a well-established restaurant. I actually rly enjoyed the crab XLB though. Noodles are extremely oily and not special. Green beans were soggy, no crunch, but at least not too oily. Really not impressed by this place."
679,"So good.  Came here for the best pork and crab soup dumplings in NY. Wonderful flavor, the crab comes right through in the broth and filling.  Nice thick wrapping to prevent tears.Well oiled machine. Get un ""line"" at front desk. A 10-15 minute wait at lunch on a Tuesday. Gorgeous, newly renovated modern birch interior.Small beer, wine and sake selection.  Dining alone I did not get to explore the menu further, but al the plates that came out looked great."
680,I was referred here by a friend and it was amazing! The soup dumplings were incredible and so was the friend rice! I will recommend this place to anyone looking for great Chinese food in NYC!
681,"If you are looking for the best soup dumplings, Joe's Shanghai is IT! But warning for the WAITING TIME and the CASH ONLY policy (ATM inside).Decided to dine in for some hot soup dumplings on a chilly fall Sunday night. I didn't think the line would be long, but I underestimated it. I arrived around 7:40 and was told the wait was an hour but was seated at 9:10 - roughly 1 hour and 30 minutes instead. They do not seat people based on who arrives first but based on the table that is available, so they will call out number after and before you to accommodate different party sizes. I suggest you take the time to walk around Chinatown to get dessert, something to drink, or peruse their menu online to know what you want once you sit down. If the wait isn't too long then stay outside the main entrance because they will only call the number 2-3 times before moving on to the next ticket.Finally seated, we knew what we wanted to eat and ordered right away. We ordered 2 orders of the pork meat soup dumplings, sauteed string bean w/ minced pork, Szechuan beef noodle soup, and the pecking style minced pork noodle (to go). Our soup dumplings arrived within 5-10 minutes and the following entrees followed after. I was so excited for the soup dumplings, forgot how hot the soup was that I might have burned the roof of my mouth - but still worth it and it just shows you how fresh they are. The string beans were subpar and the Szechuan noodles had a nice kick to it. Portion sizes were large for two people - we prioritized the soup dumplings and were able to take some noodles and string beans home.After we asked for the check, the takeout noodles were dropped off and we were given some slices of orange to top off our meal. For that much food, we spent ~$65! Overall delicious food and the soup dumplings are worth the hype! I checked out other reviews and heard that the scallion pancakes and the eggplant in garlic sauce are also famous there - will have to try those next time I come!"
682,"We went to Joe's Shanghai after the Interactive Van Gogh experience (thank you Yelp Elite community for those free tix!)We ordered the soup dumplings with pork and crab meat, and we both thought they were delicious and well priced, as well. The kung Pao chicken -- somewhat of a basic normie choice -- was also appetizing. Really not the kind of the dish you'd expect them to screw up. It came with a side of white rice. The Szechuan noodles, however, were pretty plain, and we didn't think the stew was anything to write home about. However, the accompanying beef was just chewy enough and very tasty!The service at Joe's Shanghai deserves a mention because it is mediocre. The hostess was kind, but the waiters pressured us into ordering right after we got there, and kept walking near our table after it was served, never asking about our meal, or offering more water as our glasses of water emptied out. Rozena says this type of a service is normal especially in Chinatown, but I think differently."
683,One of the best soup dumplings in the city.The line might be long but trust me your stomach will thank you later.We also ordered Shanghai Noodles which was nicely done. Weekdays dinner well worth it.
684,"I heard about all the hype with Joe's Shanghai and my friend actually told me his last meal on Earth would be their chili prawns so I meannnnnn I had to see what the hype was all about.We came here around 6 and waited 30 min for a table which I felt wasn't that long since we came during peak dinner time. They had a temperature check at the front and a place to sign-in with your phone number (I'm assuming to give customers a call if there were any covid issues?) and we got seated at a table that an employee had just sanitized. We ordered the crab meat and pork soup dumplings, chili prawns with shell off, sauteed flat thick noodle with beef and sauteed string beans with minced pork. Ok, first of all, the XLB is filled to the absolute brim with delicious soup. I have never encountered a XLB with that much soup inside. The filling was full of flavor and you can taste the crab and pork really well. The other menu items were all equally delicious and I can see why my friend loves the chili prawns so much. The prawns are super plump and the sauce has the perfect balance of sweet & sour and loaded with large pieces of garlic.Wow, honestly 10/10 solid meal! We even considered coming here a second time but decided against it to try other foods, but I'll definitely be coming back on my next NY trip."
685,"Is there anything I can say about this New York institution that hasn't already been said? No, but here's my review anyways. This spot is for anyone who has a craving for soup dumplings, wants an introduction to soup dumplings, or has a bit of time on their hands for the wait time. However, I highly suggest shifting your eating schedule slightly up if you're planning on visiting- especially on the weekends. By arriving around 11:30 am, instead of 12 to 3, you can get seated almost immediately, rather than standing outside for around 45 minutes after the place (and queue) fills up faster than the speed of light.My theory is that their soup dumplings went ""viral"" on the internet due to the novelty of having soup inside of a dumpling, which seems rather rare in other cultures. However, other authentic Chinese dishes are just as great, but without a funky combination of two foods. If you're new to Chinese food, I highly recommend trying out the 鱼香茄子, or ""Eggplant with Garlic Sauce (w. Pork)"", under the vegetables section. It's the ultimate combination of sweet and savory, which pairs incredibly with the creamy eggplant. It must be eaten with rice. The bathroom is a little janky, especially having to walk down a narrow corridor of steps to get to it, but the rest of the restaurant is nice and clean! I'm not sure that it would be accessible to people with mobility issues."
686,"There is usually a wait if you just show up and it's pretty chaotic inside. They'll take your phone number outside the door though. Expect the wait to be around 30 minutes depending on group size. We just got two things of the XLBs and it was surprisingly enough to fill two people. Pretty good price for 8 dumplings. We spent around $20 for two. The dumplings themselves were good, a little easy to break but very juicy on the inside. Comes with tea on the side!This place is cash only which is kind of annoying, but they have an ATM by the door if you need to grab some cash."
687,"I discovered this tourist spot by accident. I thought it was gonna be Joe's rice rolls. Their specialty is pork/crab soup dumplings. The first few were good; the crab is with pork. The remainder weren't so good. I dunno why. On the other hand, the eggplant slaps! Usually the eggplant is shrimp but theirs comes with tender pork strips. Delish leftovers. The service was meh. Oh they only take cash"
688,"Easy to miss from the outside, but you definitely don't want to miss this place. The milieu is welcoming to families and the staff is fast paced. Food came out within minutes of ordering and blew us away. The sesame chicken is a must, and is served with the fluffiest rice you can imagine. It dances on your tongue ever so delicately and is no doubt the soulmate to the sesame chicken. The broccoli is average. Also would avoid the crunchy chicken noodles."
689,"Super ecstatic we got to visit a little bit of Chinatown during this visit. Luckily there was hardly a wait and were seated under 10 minutes upon arrival. These portions are huge and definitely a bang for your buck. The crab and pork soup dumplings were amazing. Super fatty broth and yummy flavor as any soup dumpling should. I usually don't have a hard time finishing these but we were absolutely stuffed though I have no complaints here. In addition to the fried noodle entree we ordered, this was more than enough for two people. Could probably feed 3-4, realistically. Quick service and good food, I'd recommend!"
690,Solid happy hour prices and great late night spot to hang out with friends Would definitely recommend + come back
691,Drinks were fun in the Capri Sun like packets and food was so yummy! Definitely would come again.
692,Great drinks and atmosphere! Love the tables and good for groups / playing soju drinking games. Decor is super cute. Service also great it was really crowded but the host made sure we were seated right away. My friends and I had a good time
693,"Amazing service, I love the communal dinner vibe. It reminds me of hosting dinner parties at home.Also make sure to order the food, especially the chicken."
694,"Anytime is okay. It's a restaurant in the heart of K-Town with decent food and drink options. I didn't get their popular plastic casing-style drinks, but they seem to be popular. They did not appear to be worth the price, but to each their own, and more importantly, I did not actually try it.I came for happy hour, but I was disappointed by their selection. They have some minor house wines, a couple beers, and soju that honestly didn't feel like HH prices.Their food was fine, but some of the portions were disappointing. I believe it was the creamy mentaiko ramen dish, which tasted fine, but left me wanting more in terms of volume. Also, the ramen noodles looked straight out of an instant noodle packet. Their popcorn chicken wasn't really popcorny; just chicken. Service was good and the atmosphere is good, so it'll be a good place to go with friends to hang out. Most people here are in groups, are drinking, and having lots of conversation (noise levels are comfortably high).Overall, I wouldn't be in a rush to return here. There are tons of other options to dine, so I would try them before returning here."
695,"Lovely ambience, had a great time with friends! Highly recommend to anyone. Waitstaff very friendly too!:)"
696,"We shared truffle fries, bulgogi fries, bulgogi burger, mini unagi don, Brussel sprouts and popcorn chicken. We had the lychee & white peach caprisuns. Lychee was great.Breaded Brussel Sprouts in a tangy ttoebucki like sauce- yummy. Popcorn ch was a redder version of general Tsos chicken- not a bad nor good thing.No no no to unagi don that was sooooo puny. Fries were fried hard, orangy crisp - awesome. Truffle flavor was light and bulgogi nearly nonexistent. Same for the burger that came out 40 minutes later after asking several times. They need to do better about being generous w $16 fries & burgers than 3 strips of bulgogi. That is clearly not ok. But I'm gonna call it what it is- a fast, pretty tasty quick fix that is not that cheap. Very gimmicky replete w wall decals... but lotsa tables that fill up immediately so clearly anytime is doing something right...? I'm not sure but this spot isn't really for me."
697,Everything we got was so good! Highly recommend if you're looking for a cute place with friends YUM
698,"The food here is nothing special. Most are fusion dishes without much finesse. Ordered the cod roe ramyun and it looked and tasted like someone overcooked a pack of knockoff ramen noodles (def not shin ramen because the noodles were pale and limp) and slapped a ladle of salted cream and a few pieces of boiled salmon onto it. Had potential, but executed poorly for $16.95. I could have made this at home for $3. The bulgogi tteobokki was strangely sweet with a sweet soy sauce soup and did not taste korean at all. My friends and I agreed that it tasted like Chinese home cooking (rice cakes dumped into soy sauce broth) with a tad too much sugar. Do not order if you like the traditional red pepper rice cakes because these are so far from that. Salmon ceviche was not bad, tasted like poke with a light spicy Mayo. The only dish I enjoyed was the taco wasabi (raw octopus with wasabi). The portion was extremely small though. I agree with other reviews about the clientele: young adults looking to pregame and eat cheap drunk food, except the food is not cheap at all for what you get. It tastes like an amateur went to the kitchen and experimented with random ingredients. There are better casual/cheap options for the price, such as the noodle places in the food court down the street where the noodles are actually executed well."
699,This place is getting more popular now and also has nice ambiance. There is a whole turf grass wall and lights. Nice place to go for something more casual and be able to hear your friends. I think the food here is very mediocre. The portions are very small. We got the super creamy tteokbokki. It was in a small bowl. It was creamy but not sure if it is worth the price tag as it is just rice cakes and gochujang. I also got the New York burger. The burgers come on a really small plate and very messy to eat. Ask for sauce on the side if you want it to be a little less messy. The brioche bun is not fluffy and was cold. It was also a bit stale. The patty is very thin. Overall the burger was on the colder side and not very flavorful. I am not sure if I would come back here because the portions are so small and food was cold
700,Hands-down my favorite French spot in NYC.The vibe and decor is exceptionally Parisian and feels super-luxe. I would definitely recommend for a date or girl's night out. I've been here multiple times and have ordered wine flights as well as small plates. I would highly suggest making a reservation unless you are willing to wait (even for a couple of seats at the bar).
701,"My friend and I sat outside and shared burrata, Brussel sprouts, and their Charcuterie Plate. It's in a fun location on a busy street of outdoor dining.Their wine and service was good. I overheard an older couple say they've been going there for like 15 years? it's good mix of different types of people"
702,I had one of my favorite wine's ever here! Everything about this place is amazing from the wine to the food to the atmosphere. I would recommend this place for when you want to treat yourself with friends or maybe to take a date!
703,Always love Amelie but the recent lunch visit was disappointing.Lunch wine flight feel like become stingier pour compare to before.Crab Crostini $16 - two pieces small but not badSteak $26 - two small pieces of steak this was indeed a joke.....
704,"A very fancy place for what they sell, but I had a  simple dinner meal here the other day. Let me just recommend the service. It was good; it was easy to get the staff's attention. The staff was kind enough to let us seated and read through the whole menu without rushing. They making sure everything is okay for you. Safety dining was also implemented. Seating is limited because there are borders in some tables and of course, due to social distancing guidelines. The place is intimate and clean. I also like that there is a sanitizer on every table. The restroom was clean as well. I also loved the decorations, they make me feels very relaxed.I ordered smoked salmon, and I love the smoky flavor and sweet sauce in it. Serving may seem small, but it was enough to reminisce its taste. Their Filet Mignon has a subtle taste but, it was freshly cooked, and it's served hot. I like it. Serving time was not too long but not fast as well. You can't really miss this place if you're around. I will bring my colleagues here for dinner more often."
705,"Was craving French food the other day and found this nice casual dining spot for brunch. Got the octopus for appetizer and lamb burger (not pictured) for main entree, both were delicious! The bottomless mimosa option was also on point. Would recommend this place!"
706,"This is maybe a 3.5 star spot, but hey, we round up these days.Came here for a friend's birthday dinner. We started with a drink- she got Prosecco and I asked the server for a recommendation for a white with duck. He was super helpful with it, and I ended up really enjoying the pairing. I started with the octopus. The ratatouille underneath was DELICIOUS. Unfortunately, octopus is super finicky, and it seems a few of my pieces got overcooked, leading to a definite jaw workout. My friend got the goat cheese app. It. Was. Amazing. So good. Would get three of those if we came again! Entree was the duck confit. I've never had this dish, so didn't know what exactly I was getting. I was definitely expecting a rich, fatty meal. The meat really wasn't the experience I'd pictured- but it was good. Much less rich and fatty than I'd anticipated. It was served over mushrooms and potatoes. Both my friend and I found the mushrooms to be a pass (chewy), but the potatoes were delicious! Our waiter, at this point, became a bit hard to pin down for the check, but other tables seemed to be at points that all required attention. Overall, not unreasonable price wise for a nice dinner for two in Manhattan. I'd come back, but with so many other spots to try, I'd prefer to go to a new spot next time we're in the mood to eat fancy."
707,"Good service, very kind and got us wine and food within 7 mins of being seated. Took one star off because the roasted cauliflower was a bit mushy, but I would definitely go back to give it another shot."
708,"INCREDIBLE FOOD!!!I came here for a date night with my boyfriend a few weeks ago and I have nothing but great things to say about this place! I would say I'm not the biggest fan of French food however after trying this place out I would say I definitely would come back to try more from their menu... We didn't have any reservations which I wish we knew ahead of time because the wait was quite long but the service and attention we had from the waiter was impeccable! We started off with some wine which was the reason we came and then we wanted to get something to nibble on since we were a bit hungry. For this reason, my boyfriend decided to order the escargot since I've never had it and the duck confit which I've had before but never at this restaurant. Both dishes were absolutely amazing and I would most definitely recommend them to anyone that comes to this place. The best part was that at the end we were given a small glass of wine on the house which I truly appreciated. Highly recommend, 5/5 for sure! Also the wine was delicious :)"
709,"Cute space, super friendly servers. Felt a little rushed but I understand it's busy. Chèvre salad needed more flavor and so did the moules marinieres. Not that robust. Wine selection was great. I'd like to patronize again."
710,"I always come to New York wondering why Russ and Daughters is one of the must visits for bagels. As the last meal before departing NYC, I had to get a Nova bagel with everything. Now the price isn't cheap but the experience and the exposure to one of New York's iconic places is a must. I would recommend anyone to come early, grab a number, and get themselves a bagel (I highly prefer Nova Salmon)."
711,"First time at Russ and Daughters! Gotta say, it was amazing.The bagel itself was good, not amazing but good. However, the Irish smoked salmon was amazing. Definitely the best lox that I've ever had. The cream cheese and simple onion/tomato combo was perfect with it.Highly recommend!"
712,"This is the best place in the city to come for smoked fish. There are so many different varieties of lox - gravalox, Norwegian smoked, belly lox, Scottish smoked, Nova smoked, wild western, Irish organic etc. I think I have tried all of them at this point. I basically get the same thing every time- everything bagel toasted with scallion cream cheese and some sort of lox. On the weekends, it gets crowded, but its's definitely worth the wait. This spot is for takeout only but they also have a sit down restaurant nearby. There is a little park across Houston that's a nice place to sit especially when it's nice out.You can preorder large cuts of lox to-go. We have done this several times and brought lox to parties or family events. They can give you an insulated pack that keeps it cool for travel."
713,"Holy Bagels & Lox Batman! Russ & Daughters Jewish deli is especially rewarding during the pandemic because getting one of the city's chewiest bagels cradling smoked salmon or cured salmon (they have both) smeared with cream cheese is a true New York tradition. Of course the line is as real as Covid-19, so plan accordingly. Luckily, what's waiting for you is a top-10 bagel plus these lower east side favorites: * caviar - Malossol only! * smoked Scottish salmon * Scandinavian gravlox * Smoked pastrami-cured salmon * smoked fish - sable! sturgeon! * herring - pickled-yes; smoked-yessir * capers - always non-pareil * wasabi flying fish roe * dried Fruit - apricots, mango, more * nuts - pistachios, cashews, u choose * matzo ball soup * sweet sweet halvah! * babka - cinnamon or chocolate :) * bialys if bagels aren't your thing"
714,"$15 for a bagel and a long line? If you're a fan of lox bagels and quality smoked salmon then it's definitely worth a try and maybe another try after that. Their classic with tomatoes, onions, and capers and scallion cream cheese, on a toasted everything bagel was absolutely delicious. Although it may not compare to other bagels in NYC, the salmon itself is worth it. Also they have a bunch of other sides and treats you can get! The black and white cookie was slightly citrusy and the perfect dessert after our bagels."
715,"Why did Doordash say there was a $50 minimum order?? I couldn't figure it out and I had to try these bagels so I schlepped to Orchard Street from Midtown to try these bagels on a very cold Sunday morning...Bagels are priced at $1.50 each, I ordered the assortment. After trying a couple of bites, I didn't like how hard the bagels were, I prefer a little softer and lightly toasted.  I'm taking these back to LA, so let's see how they taste tomorrow!"
716,"This was a must visit for this trip in New York City. I was looking forward to the smoked salmon and we ended up ordering pumpernickel with salmon and salmon roe with onions and capers- also know as Daughters.  The line was about 15 minutes long in the cold which seemed longer because it was cold. The staff were not very friendly but that was just expected from the reviews, but they do interact more with people that are Spanish-speaking or maybe more attractive.We took our bagel a few doors down which is Katz Delicatessen and I couldn't pass on a pastrami sandwich. We ordered our Katz pastrami sandwiches and ate our bagel in one sitting and escaped the cold."
717,"Wow there's a reason why so many media publications flock here to produce content-everything from the bagels, salmon type, and cream cheese are so so good. Definitely worth if you don't have to wait in a long line or grab a number! We ordered two Everything bagels with vegetable cream cheese and Norwegian smoked salmon. The bagels also taste good with the additional add ons of tomato and onion, but beware that it's an additional $0.50 charge for each. They package the bagels pretty good in the branded wax paper, but make sure if you're eating it for later or commuting that they also place a layer of plastic-they forgot it the second time and our bagels were runny."
718,"We took the red eye from CA to NY and knew the first thing we wanted was a bagel.  I was expecting a long line but got right in and waited about 10 minutes total to be helped and served.I ordered the onion bagel with scallion cream cheese while the hubby ordered the everything with vegetable cream cheese.  I was tempted to get a juice, dried pears and a chocolate babka while I was there, but it was day 1 and I knew i better pace myself.  The bagel was good, though a bit on the dry side and lacked the chewiness I was looking for.   The cream cheese though was about an inch and a half thick and so flavorful.  The packaging was nicely done and can tell care, attention and detail goes into every aspect of this shop."
719,"After my red-eye flight from CA and waiting for the hotel room to become available, since all I had was time at that point I decided to swing by Russ & Daughters and finally get to try their lox. It was a Tuesday morning and I arrived at 9:15am, there were about 20 people in line; because of social distance rule they only allowed 5 customers in the store at each time. The line moved pretty slowly and I could finally get in after about 30 mins wait.As a first time customer the wide selection on the menu did give me some headache at first but the staff were all very nice and patient and explained the different options they offered. I was planning to get only one bagel but a lot of reviewers said good things about the white fish salad option too so I decided to get two - two bagels for one person for breakfast was actually a bit too much ;)Lox Bagel: ASo I decided to go with Poppy bagel + plain cream cheese + gaspe nova lox + tomato + onion + capre. Bagel was chewy, and I liked the plain cream cheese a lot, I'm usually not a big fan of cream cheese, but the one here was really ""plain"", it didn't have that sort of chemical taste which I often found from cream cheese bought from grocery store. The lox was delicious - it wasn't that smoky but the wooden flavor was definitely there. And all the add-ons enhanced the overall complexity of the bagel.White Fish Salad Bagel: AI chose the same poppy bagel, and the white fish salad was pretty amazing - very different from Subway's tuna sandwiches of course, the fish was chopped well so it got almost like a cheese/paste texture, yet it gave a strong fish aroma with a clean finish.Excellent bagels, friendly staff, what more can I ask for. Just try to go on weekdays at earlier times to avoid long lines."
720,"Actually super disappointed in this famous spot :( I don't know what I actually ordered because my friends waited in line and ordered for me. We didn't know what capers were, but my friend just ordered it for me since it was our first experience and I definitely DO NOT like them lol. They were too sour for my liking. But other than that, the bagel itself was super hard and the lox was very salty. Yes, I know lox is cured and is supposed to be salty LOL but this was way over the top salty!! I thought maybe all NY bagel places tasted like this until I tried another spot a couple days later that was WAYY better than Russ. Their freshly squeezed orange juice is bomb though, but this is a bagel place hahaha. I think my friends went early and waited about an hour(?) Almost $20 for a bagel...def not worth it, there's other better bagel places in NY!!"
721,"Soooo... I am a huge bagel-n-lox chick... was v excited to come here and snag one of these for my car ride home. I popped in around 10 and got lucky, not much of a line as the 3 people in there before me were already being helped. I had a toasted sesame bagel with veggie cc, Norwegian Lox, onions, tomato, capers-- the works... honestly, a bit underwhelmed. The bagel kinda ruined it for me? It was def old and well done by the coloring.. I did get it toasted... it wasn't toasted enough... my guy had same thing as me except with poppy bagel; he also was kind of like ""it's whatever"".I would come here for the lox and then put it on another bagel places bagel with cream cheese  which is probably considered somewhat sac religious but I don't think I care. Satisfactory, glad I missed the line or I would have really been pissed.. seems like place holds a large reputation, kinda annoying the bagels are subpar. Our two decked out, old, cold bagels, two coffees, and a juice were $41."
722,"I've been coming here as a native new yorker raised on Orchard Street.  But I haven't ""lived"" on LES for almost twenty years.  Regardless, anytime I'm in town, I try my best to stop in and stock up.  Currently 5 customers at a time which is a huge difference from the days when it would be packed like sardines and you need to remember to grab a number to be called.  I walked in and one of the older guys nodded hello.  I ended having him as my server and he said he remembered me.  It's been almost 3 years since I was last in the shop.  I did stock up on that last visit.  Well this time, gravlax and sable split into three packages to share with family and friends.  a quart of mixed pickles.  a few black and whites.  some dried pears.  and a classic sandwich with the works for myself.  He gave me scottish smoked salmon and it was lovely.  Support local businesses folks!"
723,Be prepared to wait in line. You can also order ahead and do pickup. Either way completely worth the wait. Best bagels I've ever had anywhere. A definite must try when in NYC
724,"Did you really visit NYC if you didn't pick up some bagels?This was my first time trying Russ & Daughters and I was impressed with all the different kinds of smoked and cured salmon they had. This is definitely the bagel spot for salmon bagel lovers! The bagel was yummy and made for a filling meal. It did seem a bit salty though, so it wasn't the best bagel shop I've had on this trip. I also wasn't able to try the wasabi roe as it was sold out by the time I got there, maybe next time.There was a line on a Sunday afternoon and it took around 20 mins to be served, so be prepared to wait.I also recommend grabbing a can of their Dr Brown's Cream Soda. Such a delicious refreshment that goes well with the bagel.What I Ordered:-Everything Bagel with Norwegian Smoked Salmon, Scallion Cream Cheese, Capers, Onions, and Tomatoes"
725,"I've been here so many times but I'm lucky to have never experienced an hour long line... until 2021. While waiting, my friends got me a Korean corn dog from around the corner, and it hit the spot while I waited 30 more minutes for my turn.You could order ahead from the app, but I had completely forgotten. Still, my bagel tasted great! The vegan cream cheese was so smooth and creamy that I couldn't believe it wasn't dairy. There's just something special about getting a bagel, some small snacks, and a mug (to replace one I broke in 2018) that just makes the wait worth it."
726,"What I ordered | Classic Bagel & Lox ($15) Noxa Smoke Salmon with your choice of bagel/cream cheese. I chose the everything Bagel, Scallion Cream Cheese | + Capers & Red Onions ($0.50 each)Taste | flavor was good and its a decent portion. It is kind of pricy for the size. I liked the variety of cream cheese options as well as bagels sandwiches. Service | Workers were nice and very patient! Parking | street Notes | waited 45 min in line as they only allow 5 ppl inside at a time. This was on a Friday morning around 9 AM. I would not wait in line for that long but definitely recommend getting there when they open or slightly before they open to avoid the lines."
727,"I don't know where to start. This has probably been hands down one of the best bagels I've had. The lox was  so delicious. I had a toasted everything bagel with lox cream cheese, pastrami salmon, with capers, tomatoes and red onions. I recommend getting the bagel toasted. It'll be a bit tough to bite through if you don't, which can throw off your whole experience. Staff was very helpful and friendly. I also tried their various smoked salmon and they were all very tasty. Your bagel can get pretty expensive very quickly if you add a lot of things on it. A bagel can easily go over $15, but what you pay for is 100% worth it. I highly recommend you come before opening because there tends to be a long line each time!"
728,"I can gather this place has been around for years and it's probably a classic place to some New Yorkers, but I just couldn't figure out what they were selling because the menu and other goodies were all over the place. I wasn't sure about what to buy where. I'm sure they keep everything the way it's been since forever ago because that's classic to them but for me it felt disorganized. I also felt like I couldn't ask too many questions since the workers seemed very quiet and busy. Anyway I took a number ticket and the front, waited for my turn, and ordered the salmon lox bagel with tomato and onion (50c extra for the thinnest slice of each) and the total was about $18. It was a very delicious bagel, don't get me wrong. Is this a normal price? I wouldn't know since it was my first NY bagel but hey, I'll still recommend it!"
729,"Russ & Daughters had extreme measures for Covid, only allowing 6 people at a time, which I loved! We went early in the morning during a weekday and took us about 30 minutes to get in. We ordered their signature lox bagel on everything bagel with scallion spread... and sorry to say that it did not measure up to my expectations.Salmon was fresh but the spread was blend and the bagel was hard.  Needless to say, it just didn't come together well and my all time favorite is still Ess-a bagel.Aside from the lox bagel, we tried the chocolate babka and was pleasantly surprised that I was sad that we had only picked up a slice."
730,"Ah yes, the iconic place to grab a lox bagel in NYC. I got ""the classic"" and unfortunately it was just okay overall. A bit greasy to the touch and the bagel itself was pretty tough (might be my bad for getting the bagel toasted but it wasn't even crispy). A little skimpy on the lox compared to the amount of lox I've had in other lox bagels that were similarly priced. Though, what I really liked was the cream cheese; whipped to perfection and was seasoned very well. Scrumptious.I mean, if getting a lox bagel at Russ & Daughters is on your bucket list then by all means go ahead and get one here. Based on the lox bagel that I had though I don't think it's worth the wait in line (if the line wraps around the street corner expect a 30+ min wait). There are plenty of spots in NYC that have pretty good lox bagels (with minimal waiting-in-line time) so if you have just a general itch for a lox bagel I recommend at least first looking up places in the area!"
731,"I expected a bit more considering the hype around this place. Ordered the classic with scallion cream cheese, everything bagel. The charge you extra for tomatoes, capers and onions... that's annoying. I feel like those should come standard with lox and bagels. I asked for it toasted today- it was not when I received it. Order mistake and charging extra for toppings really killed it for me today."
732,"Solely for take out only! I placed an order this morning for two bagels, 1 lox and 1 bagel/schmear combo. Boyfriend loved the lox bagel, it can tightly wrapped and cut in half. He added red onion which is 50 cents (why.. I have no idea lol). Delicious bagel though, he thoroughly loved it ($15.50 which according to him is median for a NYC lox bagel) I got a everything bagel with goat cheese cream cheese and tomato (I added cucumber and salt and pepper from my kitchen to top). This is definitely not a great selection if you're allergic to white fish like me :( but BOY did the flavors make up for it. The cream cheese was incredible. So light and the perfect ratio. IMO it would've been tasty without my extra add-ons from my kitchen. ($6, which is a bit pricy for a bagel with no real extras)They do not toast their bagels (that I know of) and it's a very traditional lox bagel situation. Thoroughly enjoyed it! Delivery came fast, everything was packaged and perfectly cut in half."
733,"A decent bagel with lox, but not the best I've ever had. And not worth the price. I've seen some photos of their bagels and they look well cooked/baked. The bagel I got, however, was very dense and dry, which made it difficult to eat. There was a good amount of lox but only a thin spread of cream cheese (you might want to ask for more cream cheese if you like a good amount in your bagel). Be aware that you'll probably be in line between 30 minutes to an hour if you're not the first in line when they open. With covid restrictions, they're only allowing 5-6 people in the shop at a time. You can call and order ahead to skip the line.Overall, the cool part of visiting the shop was the history. Russ & Daughters attracts a lot of tourists, but in my opinion, the bagel was not worth the price."
734,"Main attraction here is the quality of the smoked salmon. And that they smoke the salmon in-house. Other than that, not worth it. Be prepared for a long line that moves slow. Only 5 people allowed inside at a time due to covid, which is great. We waited 45-60 minutes to get 1 bagel. Got the classic. Bagel was not great - asked for it toasted but the texture was rubbery inside. Like the dough wasn't properly risen. Cream cheese was bland and the staff only put a thin layer. Lox was okay, but frugal with the serving portion size.Overall, I'm glad to have tried it given the long history of the shop. But probably wouldn't return due to the high price point, wait, and the bagel just not being worth it. If you're looking for a piece of history, give it a try. If you're looking for a good bagel, save your time and money and go to a local bagel shop.Note: They take credit card on a $10 minimum. Which shouldn't be a problem given that most items are ~$20 anyway."
735,"WHO TOLD ME RUSS & DAUGHTERS WAS GOOD -- I'm a visitor, and I had been told that Russ & Daughters bagels hit differently. So I had been waiting to try for at least 4 years now, and it did NOT meet my expectations. 1) Bagels were TOO cold and not toasted enough.2) Lox too salty 3) Not enough cream cheese All this for $19.... For one bagel... not worth itPerhaps this is because they only do take-out right now, but I did open my food right after it was served. Never again. The local NYC bagel shops are so much better."
736,"Not the biggest fan of bagels, but I learned right away that it's because I haven't been eating the RIGHT bagels.Came in on a Saturday morning and, as expected, the line was 20 deep outside. Store policy is no more than 5 customers inside because of COVID, so I didn't mind the wait. It was well worth it, even for a warm-weather guy like me having to brave 35 degree temps.Although they sell other items here like bake goods and dried fruit, it's the smoked fish bagel sandwiches people wait in line for. And for good reason. They are amazing!You can choose from several sandwiches that all have names. I got the Generational, which has slices of smoked salmon and sturgeon. You can also choose from a variety of bagels and spread for your sandwich. I added capers and onions to mine to give it an extra kick.From the first bite, you can tell it's all quality stuff. The bagel tasted like it just came from the oven. The salmon wasn't salty at all; had a mild, fresh flavor. I've never had smoked sturgeon before as I really don't know where to get it around my town. But man, I've been missing out. So tasty. Again, not salty at all. Just a mild flavor, almost like it was cut right from the fish fresh. Not sure how they've been able to cure and smoke these fish while retaining its flavor. Very nice job!Yes, I know it's pretty expensive for a sandwich, but I think if you've got the means, treat yourself once in a while to a great bagel sandwich from this spot!"
737,"My favorite bite of bagel! The salmon roe in the bagel was a game changer as you get pops of umami, salty egg along with the cream cheese filled bagel. This line is long but I think it's well worth the wait to give it a try. If you're not traveling here alone, have your friend go get Katz Deli next door so you can eat while you're in line for Russ & Daughters. Although pricey at over $20, the bagel is big and will make you full. There is no shortage of ingredients in the bagel. I would definitely come back here for that bagel!"
738,"First time visiting R&D today. We ordered the original and shtetl to go with latke and coffee. Definitely on the pricier end, $50 bill for the two of us. Was it worth it? One hundred times yes. I had no idea what I had been missing out on my whole life. I love salmon and this was the freshest lox of my lifetime. Overall I actually preferred the sable (white fish) on the shtetl more. Don't forget to buy the latke and heat them up at your hotel. Holy moly these had impeccable flavor! Beyond happy with what we ate, devastated that they don't have a location in our city."
739,"Right up there with the top Yelper's must-do in NYC, like The Halal Guys' food cart is Russ & Daughters, and the Classic Smoked Salmon with Cream Cheese on a Bagel.I saw a short line and I lucked out at just a 20-minute wait to get in and order my classic with an untoasted Everything Bagel, Scallions Cream cheese, I kept it very simple. Delizioso !!!  fresh soft Bagel, creamy fresh cheese, and buttery Nova Scotia Salmon.Is it overhyped, yeah a little and my pocket took a $15 hit,  but hey both I and this place are still here after 18 months of covid-19, and I need to celebrate don't you think?"
740,"The line is ridiculously long. We came at the wrong time and ended up waiting over an hour! They move pretty slow here but you can tell each bagel is made with care. Nothing is pre-made and they slice the lox right in front of you.I got the egg bagel with scallion cream cheese and lox. Delicious!! There's just something about NY bagels that hits different.If it weren't for the long wait, I would come here all the time. But as with any good bagel spot, there's bound to be a long line."
741,"WORTH THE WAIT!!! The best lox ever. I went with the classic everything bagel with lox, scallion cream cheese, tomato, red onion and capers. I don't even like capers but everything paired perfectly together.I didn't care for the pastrami lox. It just wasn't my jam.I would definitely come back!!!The staff was very friendly."
742,"Exceptionally good NYC bagels.  They only allow 5 people in at a time but the line moves fairly quickly. Kids got plain + everything bagel w the classic cream cheese.  I got the bagel and lox w goat cheese, tomato, red onion and capers plus a large coffee to go.You can stock up on dried fruit, candies and other sweets as well as get your fill on all things sturgeon.If you want to skip the line, call ahead and pick up when you arrive!"
743,"One of the best lox bagels I have ever had! This small shop is known for the quality of their smoked salmon and array of cream cheeses and it did not disappoint. I ordered an everything bagel with smoked salmon, scallion cream cheese, onion and tomato and it was so flavorful, well balanced and filling. Due to covid, only 5 people or so are allowed into the store at a time so the ambiance and service was quiet, well intentioned and kind. My friend and I waited for about 30-40 minutes to get into the store, order and pay for our food but the bagel was worth the wait! Since we were waiting in line next to a local who has been going to this store for over 60 years, we asked for pastry recommendations and ended up leaving with a black and white cookie and an assorted container of rugelach. The black and white cookie was traditional and a nice post brunch treat. The rugelach was also flavorful and would pair best with a cup of hot coffee!"
744,"Absolutely delicious! I've heard the hype, and it's legit. I have never been someone who really enjoyed  lox as I always found it way too smokey. But given that there were like 8 types on menu, it was worth exploring and seeing if maybe I could find a variety to change my mind... and gasp(e) I did! The gaspe lox was awesome! More mild, super delicate, and a perfect addition to my everything bagel and veggie cream cheese. Yes! So happy with my decision! The service was great! Seriously. They have a great and efficient system to keep things moving at this bustling eatery. So glad to come!"
745,"Really torn about this review, because were the bagels delicious?? Absolutely. Was it worth the higher price point and long wait? I'm not sure. THE CLASSIC: 9/10Their (and pretty much NYC's) quintessential bagel, with smoked salmon and your choice of cream cheese. Other toppings are available at an extra cost. The smoked salmon tasted so fresh and melts in your mouth. We got the dill cream cheese and added red onions. Other than the fish, I thought the bagel was slightly above average and the flavour was great but not the best bagel I've had. Their bagels also felt a bit small, but was that just me? SUPER HEEBSTER: 8/10I read a ton of reviews suggesting getting this since it's such a unique flavour. It's definitely not for everyone, and it tasted like a tuna sandwich to me. Glad I tried it, but I definitely preferred the Classic."
746,"We stopped by on a quick food tour of NY and after trying a classical bagel and lox, I can say this place my change your life!A plain bagel with scallion cream cheese, gaspe nova smoked salmon, onion and capers was straight up one of the best things I've ever tasted! The bagel was just chewy enough, the cream cheese perfectly smooth and the salmon with accoutrements salty, a little sour, and just plan perfect! I've never gussied about a bagel, but this wins the day!We grabbed a dozen bagels that we enjoyed this morning and some chocolate babka...warm that baby for 10 seconds and taste the magic! They've got a ton of different types of smoked salmon, cream cheese, fish, chocolates and fruits. Someday we're gonna go in and just spend $1000 on a trial of everything they have - it would be well worth it!They don't need my seal of approval as they've been doing this since before my grandparents were alive, but they've got it!"
747,"Got my NYC bagel :') Love that you can customize this bagel to your liking! So many cream cheese options, bagel options, and various toppings...well fillings? They put so much smoked salmon and it's so fun to watch them cut it off the slab right there. They pack on the cream cheese and the scallion was the perfect flavor for the bagel as a whole. The everything bagel...a must. Gives everything a burst of flavor. We also added onion just for that little kick. It looked like they didn't have a wait, but actually we put our name down and they shot us a text when they were ready for us. It took about 30 minutes? Walk around and get some coffee to accompany your meal :)"
748,"I would rate 3.5 stars if I could. Was this the best bagel I've ever had? No, but it was solid. Was this the longest I've ever waited in line for a bagel? Absolutely, no question about that. Due to COVID, they are currently limiting how many customers can be in the shop at once (approx 5, but that seemed to vary a bit depending on party size and people who had pre-ordered and were picking up). As a result, I waited in line over an hour outside in the cold waiting to try this bagel I had heard about. When I got closer to the front, an employee would pop out occasionally and take people's orders and prep while they waited outside and then call them in to pay. Unfortunately, the bagel wasn't life-changing enough to warrant me waiting in line again, but if I were in the neighborhood and the line looked short, I would go back."
749,"Who can separate the unbreakable bond that is New York and their beloved bagel?! The only love that can be possibly be greater is that of New York and the pizza...and even that is debatable. Russ and Daughters has been replaying this love story for over 100 years. You read correctly....In business since 1914. Nothing about the outside would leave you to believe that you are about to step into a time capsule......The attentive service given to each customer is unlike anything I've ever seen at a fast moving deli. The staff meticulously constructs each sandwich as if their entire livelihood depends on it. Nothing complicated here, but the quality is everything, and it shows in every bite. The scallion cream cheese is the Can you honestly justify a bagel at a $16-19 price point? Reasonably speaking...no. I'd be lying if I said I've never had better, and way cheaper at that. But Russ and Daughter is one of the more unique stops in this iconic city that's worth experiencing."
750,WOW amazing and totally understand why there was a line when we went. We got a Pumpernickel bagwl with smoked salmon and scallion cream cheese - amazeballs. Highly rec. It is a bit on the pricier side but you can tell everything is fresh and made in-house.
751,"I should have gotten the bagel! We'd had bagels in the morning nearby so I went with the latkes and whitefish balls instead. The whitefish balls and accompanying sauce were delish, but the latkes were heavily impregnated with oil, though the available toppings were nice. We had a group at a nearby pool and decided to pop out for Russ & Daughters. The line is really something but moves pretty quickly and you can order ahead for faster pickup - though two locations are near one another so don't choose the wrong one."
752,"One of the most hyped bagel spots in NYC that I've been dying to try for so long... so I was surprised when I really wasn't that impressed with it :( Came on a weekday around 11am and waited around 20 minutes. There is usually always a line / wait here so be prepared, especially on weekends. I ordered the classic sandwich with nova lox, tofu scallion cream cheese, and added tomato on an everything bagel. The sandwich was pretty small and they only gave two very thin slices of lox..... for $16. For that price, I was expecting a thiccc bagel with lots of salmon but this was not the case.Taste wise... the bagel was not good? It was definitely below average when it comes to New York bagels-- kind of dense, not super soft or well textured on the outside. The tofu scallion cream cheese was good, standard. There was barely any fish in the sandwich, but I suppose the lox I did get to taste was good and flavorful. With that being said, I couldn't help but feel like this was not worth $16 at all.I'm very sad this did not live up to the hype for me :'/ TLDR: pricey, small, mediocre bagel, not enough lox"
753,"This is the OG! I can't believe it took me this long to come here after being in NYC for 14 years.This some of the best smoked salmon in NYC and therefore on Earth. The bagels are solid, not my favorite in NY but the combination of their bagels and Lox cannot be beat. The price $$$$ but absolutely worth it! We came in the morning and there was a brief line to get him as limited guest are allowed in at once due to the pandemic. I will be back."
754,"We stayed nearby, so we ended up coming twice in a 4 day span. I had the classic with capers, scallion cream cheese, and a sesame bagel. It was fantastic. The salmon was as great as you would expect.The second time, I passed on the salmon, and just got an everything bagel with dill cream cheese. The dill was really tasty. The bagel itself was just okay, so I probably wouldn't wait in the huge line if you aren't getting salmon.I also took cinnamon and chocolate babka home, and those were a nice treat."
755,"My boyfriend and I went here because they have gluten free bagels. He had a regular bagel with lox and I had a gf with lox and caviar cream cheese. These bagels are AMMMAAZZIINNG. I would recommend them to anyone visiting. Normally when GF is on the menu, you're happy when it's edible, but these were actually very good. His normal bagel was great as well (or so I'm told). This is our favorite bagel shop in NY and a must try for anyone's list."
756,"So, I was told I needed to try their lox and bagels when I visited NYC by a friend...hands down not disappointed at all! I will say that it is more than I would usually pay for lox on a bagel but I will say it was quality and it was delicious! Be prepared to wait in a line if you don't get their early. I went on a weekday morning and there was a line and I had to wait for about 20-25 minutes. This was also during COVID, so only three customers at a time. Would definitely go back!"
757,"As luscious as their smoked salmon was in the Classic Salmon Bagel, I don't think this place is worth the hype or the long wait. Nothing was bad about their food, besides maybe the rather dense and doughy bagel, but I think you can find equally as good or better bagel elsewhere with less wait. Their shop was very nice though. Some staffs were unfriendly and out of it. You can buy a lot of things besides smoked fish like dried fruits, breads etc. so it was a nice experience to be there but I don't think I'd be back."
758,We are so obsessed with this place! While in NY we went here at least 3 times! I think it's safe to say it was addicting! I got the plain bagel cream cheese smoked salmon with tomatoes and onions. It is litterly to die for! Now that I am back home I sometimes think it would be worth it to fly for one day and eat here. There is always a line to get in but don't get discouraged wait in line!!!!
759,"Russ & Daughers sells the BEST BAGELS ON THE PLANET EARTH. There is a reason locals get in line here EVERY SINGLE DAY. The bagles, the lox, the baked goods! OMG. This place is A++!"
760,"My brother and I made a quick trip to Ippudo Westside to grab a bowl of ramen before leaving NYC. The host was extremely accommodating and held our carry on luggage while we opted to dine in. This made the dining experience very comfortable. We were fumbling with our bags while getting around the restaurant. I opted for a bowl of the Akamaru Shinaji ($18). It consisted of pork tonkotsu broth, hakata thin noodles, scallions, seasoned bamboo shoots, garlic oil, topped with Ippudo's secret ""umami dama"" paste. This bowl of ramen took me to flavortown. The broth was extremely rich and the noodles were the perfect with every bite. It was definitely on the more al dente side. I can't wait to come back to NYC for another bowl of ramen! Yum!"
761,Wow delicious variety of Ramen and other delicacies. Fast fun warm service. The pork buns are delicious and I'd recommend the spicy Ramen with pork.
762,"This is the best ramen I've ever had in North America. I'm a little biased to this location because prior to moving to NYC, I always somehow visited this location and then when I did move to NYC, I lived a couple blocks away and still do now. The wait times can be long, they do not do reservations but it's definitely worth the wait or you can try stopping by for lunch. I always get the akamaru ramen, the broth is always so rich and filled with umami flavor. Noodles are always cooked to perfection and the chashu meat is also always tender. I've also had the little don bowls that can be added to lunch as a special and they're also delicious. I always recommend this place and take friends here when they visit from out of town. Overall amazing food, atmosphere, and service!"
763,"Nice experience at Ippudo tonight. I was here a few years ago, and I feel I would've had more to say then as compared to my meal tonight, since tonight's dinner was quick. Unfortunately, I do not recall enough details to base my review on that first experience (wasn't an active Yelper back then).Tonight's was a perfect meal for this very chilly day. The food arrived quickly: nice, hot, and flavorful. Had the Karaka Spicy ramen. When ordering, I asked the waitress how spicy it is, and she said it is ""mild."" In my opinion, it might be considered mild to SOME. But it may be considered to be more on the spicier side to others. Such as myself. Don't get me wrong: It's delicious. It's just a notch above simply mild, in my opinion.No major complaints. (There's probably just a difference in the spice I can tolerate vs. what our waitress could.) Great attentive service - our glasses never went below halfway full, and our waitress followed us to the door because I left my gloves at our table, oops (bless her for saving my hands from the cold!)."
764,"Unique and yummy dishes! We arrived around 7:30 pm on Tuesday and we were seated within minutes. The atmosphere was nice. The pork bun and takoyaki were some of the best I've had. Great balance of flavors and temperature. The ramen was very interesting, peppery and buttery broth. The best part was the texture of the noodles, but the broth was lukewarm. The unagi rice rolls were presented well and tasted great but on the colder side like it was sitting or not warmed properly. The cocktails were colorful, fun and delicious as well.Highly recommend"
765,"Let me preface this by saying that the food was so good that I forgot to take more photos after the cucumbers came. We came at 4:40 on a Sunday, in the beginning of the dinner rush but were sat 20 minutes later. We also ordered the wings and it only came with 3, which was really unfortunate because there were 4 of us and it would have been nice if the waitress to mention. The ramen was really tasty so ton complaints there. As soon as we finished, they put the check on the table when we were hoping to order dessert but it felt like we were getting kicked out because of the line out the door."
766,"As a big Jin Ramen fan I was very apprehensive going here but wow was I enriched by this whole experience! Be prepared to wait. That's my only warning, it gets packed all times, everyday of the week. The seats at the middle section is the most ideal (if you have a small party), very communal and interactive. Our waitress was very joyful and accommodating, we got our wings extremely late so they took it off the bill. The Karaka Spicy was incredible! Added a seasoned soft boiled egg (drooling thinking about it)The cocktail were also strong and pleasant. However the star is the Goma Q, the seasoned cucumbers. OMG! So freaking good!"
767,"Best ramen I've ever had!! Such a fun place to go if you are wanting legit ramen for a normal price. We tried the spicy ramen and the Akumaru Shinaji. The Akumaru Shinaji was our very favorite but both were great. I've never ordered chicken as the protein in my ramen but actually preferred it here. I only wish that it included at least one or two toppings in the included price such as an egg rather than having to pay for each add on. You can't go wrong with starting with some shishito peppers, but you MUST start with some pork bao buns. I've never had some with this good of flavor. Very authentic!! Great, quick service. Fun environment."
768,"Amazingly, it was my first time here, so I was excited! They don't take reservations so there's always a wait. Came on a Thursday night at around 8pm, and the wait was about 30 mins, which wasn't bad at all.  We ordered a chicken bun each, which was more sweet than spicy, and was like a general Tso's fried chicken lol it was tasty!  Also Got the Karage with mayo dipping sauce, and the sizzling beef and Cauliflower plate.  For the Ramen, I chose the Akamaru Shinaji, which is the Pork tonkatsu broth, with garlic oil and umami paste, and added a poached egg and corn. My friends ordered the Spicy version, called Karaka. Haven't had Ramen in awhile, so I enjoyed it. The serving was just right amount, and didn't leave me wanting more noodles afterwards. Great first experience at Ippudo (finally!) And def my fav Ramen spot in the city so far!"
769,"We came in on a weekend prime lunch hour and waited for about 30 min. They have a text waitlist system! Inside, the tables were separated with plastic dividers to keep you a little more covid safe.The service was great! Super attentive and friendly. We ordered the cucumber appetizer and it was wonderfully salted and seasoned and sour. The pork buns were a good combination of fatty and meat, buns were soft. It melted in our mouths. I got the spicy ramen and it was super umami, rich, and flavorful. The ramen noodles were cooked perfectly. Must go back!!!"
770,"I was just wondering around New York City and walked by this place and I feel like I found a hidden gem. When you walk right in your hit with an amazing smell of ramen broth. We started off with the pork buns, full of flavor, juices and tender. The bun was the perfect consistency creating an amazing bite.The chicken wings were super crunchy with a pretty good sauce, I maybe would have liked it to be a tad bit sweeter but still really good.The hamachi might be one of the best I've had, nicely sliced with a great dressing.The ramen broth was warm toasty full of flavor with a nice thin noodle with just the right amount of bite to it. It's easiest the best ramen I've had and I've had a ton!"
771,"Stopped here for dinner and it was hopping. Despite how busy it looked it was only a 30 minute wait. Started with chicken and shrimp buns and they were quite good. It had a spicy creamy sauce which set it apart from other buns we've had. As busy as they are the service was good and we all enjoyed the ramen. If you like eggs and spiced foods, I'd recommend adding the tamago. The color is different, but I thought it added a different level of flavoring."
772,"I ordered the Akimaru Shinaji ($19). So strange I looked online and it said that it comes with Naruto, but in my picture there was no Naruto. Not sure what is going on. Service was very efficient yet friendly. Ramen was very earthy and the broth was neutral, pungent yet respectful. Great place to bring someone who wants elevated ramen, but doesn't have the experience to back it up."
773,"So many ramen shops focus all of their creativity on non-vegetarian broths, leaving some flavorless mushroom water for vegetarians. Ippudo on the other hand lives up to its reputation as one of Japan's most esteemed ramen outlets by placing proper attention on its vegetarian variety as well. Yes, the noodles and chashu tofu were good, but I just couldn't get enough of the well-spiced, rich umami-laden vegetarian broth!The ambiance is casual but classy, and expect a significant wait on a weekend night, but it's worth it."
774,"It was a cold and windy day.  Perfect for Ramen!  We weren't sure if we could get a table for dinner even if it was early around 6:00 given Friday.  Surprisingly the wait was only 1/2 hour for two.  They were busy.  Lower level spot that has the bar area in front and a mix of seating options.  Loud and upbeat atmosphere.We started with a Carafe of Sake (Hatsumago)-I'm not a Sake Connoisseur but it lived up to the ""medium to full body"" billing & paired well with our app.  For appetizer we tried the Shrimp Bun-perfectly fried Shrimp with the Japanese pickles and spicy sauce taking it over the top!Ramen for dinner (of course.)  Karaka Spicy-just what I needed on this cold evening.  Spicy Tonkotsu broth and the added egg is a must.   Nirvana Akamuru (Vegetarian) with their Umami paste was also enjoyed.We ordered a couple of beers (Asahi and Sapporo) to pair with our Ramen.  Although we enjoyed the Beer, unfortunately, arrived when we were almost done with our Ramen.  Our server offered sincere apologies.Overall, with the exception of the Beer timing miss, service was excellent.  They have a couple of other locations in NYC as well are in LA & SF.  We will be back!"
775,"another visit! came in super late (20 mins before closing) and was seated at the circular bar area and attended to right away. we were out in about 40 mins and there were still a lot of people at the tables eating. everything was great as always (ramen, appetizers, drinks). tried the aburi unagiri for the first time... this roll is more for show in my opinion. it has a nice saucy eel flavor but the rice again is still quite mushy, which throws me off. I won't take points off for this as this is known as a ramen place and everything else I've had has been exceptional so far. I just don't recommend either of the sushi rolls."
776,"I've been here many times over the years, and it's consistently delivered high-quality ramen. If you've never been to a ramen joint, you wouldn't go wrong by making Ippudo your first choice. That said, service can be inattentive, and the wait can be long. At my most recent visit, my guest and I had the pork buns, a Good Ol' Days cocktail, and a Scarlet Lips cocktail to start. As always, the tender pork buns barely resisted as we sank our teeth in, whetting the appetite for the meal to come. I would definitely get the Scarlet Lips again, as it started sweet and fruity, but ended dry. The Good Ol' Days is advertised as a Japanese-style Old Fashioned. As a fan of that cocktail, I'm not bothering with it again. It's not supposed to finish bright like it did, and it was citrus forward, not whiskey forward.For my main course, I picked the aburi chashu rice. The savory BBQ pork was tasty and satisfying, the lettuce added a crispy texture to the decently looked rice, and spicy mayo is always welcome on my palate. I do wish the fatty pieces had been trimmed or rendered out - in my book, those are for ramen flavoring, not part of the protein experience. My guest had zero complaints about the kimidori ramen.  Our service was definitely on the slow side. When I told the waiter I wanted to send my cocktail back, he acknowledged me, but never returned. Actually, I don't think we saw the same person twice; every course was delivered by a different waiter. Also our check took 10 minutes to pick back up while we were trying to leave. I even waved at the cash register to get someone to come over, but the employees were too into their conversation. The plastic shielding they've divided the dining room with does make the place less enjoyable, but hey, it's COVID."
777,"We got there when it open but was still waiting for 1 more person to arrive. They wouldn't seat us until the entire party was there. Service was good. We ordered Hamachi carpaccio, Takoyaki and Ippudo chicken wings to share. Everything was flavorful. I ordered the Karaka spicy ramen. It was rich and robust in flavors. You can add ramen but one serving was good enough for me."
778,"One of our family's favorite ramen joints in the city. My husband is a self-proclaimed ramen connoisseur!  This location is much better than the other location in the 40's. It is consistently delicious here.  BUT, if you come at peak hours, expect a wait of at least on hour. Opens for lunch at 11:30am. Our first time here for lunch and there was no wait. We usually dine in for dinner and unless you come at 5pm, expect a wait. The service here is always great.  The Karaka spicy ramen is our go to ramen here. My kids like to scoop out the spicy meat sauce on the side and add to each spoonful as they eat. My husband just swirls it all in. The egg is a must add!  Onsen egg is perfectly cooked. Sometimes we order two for each bowl. $2 for the onsen egg and $3 for the marinated one. We recently discovered that they added the hamachi carpaccio which is loved by the family. Always a must. We used to get the truffle fries and the shishito peppers with a yuzu dipping sauce. My new thing is to try a different bun each time we come. The shrimp bun is really really good. The shrimp is deep fried a d crispy and coated in a Vietnamese spicy sweet sauce and topped with what I think is an egg salad. The combo is yummy. My kids would like stop taking bites of it. One of our top two choices for ramen in the city."
779,"Came here for a late lunch on a Monday. But this place was still packed...The food was great! We had the deep fried chicken for appetizer. It was very juicy. The ramen was good, but a little salty. I love the rice bowl!!! Rice mixed with pulled pork, topped with BBQ pork chashu. Very flavorful. This is definitely a great place to try. The staffs are very friendly as well."
780,"Loved this place! I've gone to a different Ippudo before but I tried different items this time. It was about a 30 minute wait on a Saturday evening which isn't too bad. We got a text when the table was ready and covid cards and IDs checked. We got sat at their bar looking area but there were plexiglass dividers. The servers were very efficient and polite! Honestly probably the best takoyaki I've had in my life here. The outside is super crispy and gets to you piping hot. A lot of octopus inside and the seasoning on the outside is fantastic. Some places have mediocre takoyaki where you can just tell it was probably just frozen and heated up. But this was great - absolutely recommend if you are a fan of it. I also got the Nirvana vegetarian ramen. There are options for more add-ons but I opted not to. It was great! It was flavorful and light, not heavy at all. Definitely one of my top vegetarian/vegan ramens. I love the Tokyo style wavy noodles and it was super hot and fresh. The only other vegetarian/vegan ramen I have loved is from the Jinya Ramen chain - their Creamy Vegan Ramen. That one is a lot heavier though than this lighter broth. Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a great Ramen place nearby!"
781,"Exceptional ramen and wonderful atmosphere!I ordered a shrimp bun ($4.90) as an appetizer which came with Ippudo's original bun sauce, Japanese tarter sauce, and iceberg lettuce. The shrimp was huge and the texture was crunchy. Ippudo's original bun sauce had mild heat to it. The Japanese tarter sauce was thick and creamy. The iceberg lettuce was fresh and added a nice crunch. I totally recommend this as an appetizer!I had the Akamaru Shinaji ramen ($17). The ramen had pork tonkatsu broth, pork belly chashu, sesame kikurage mushrooms, scallion, cabbage, garlic oil, and Ippudo's secret ""Umami Dama"" paste. You can choose between the Hakata thin noodles and the Tokyo wavy noodles. I had the Hakata thin noodles which had great texture and were very chewy. The dish was so flavorful! The pork tonkatsu broth was rich and the pork belly was hearty. The mushrooms, scallions, and cabbage rounded out the dish nicely. The serving size of the Akamaru Shinaji ramen was huge! I took about half of it to go!My service was sufficient. The waitress and service time was standard. No complaints.I absolutely love the ambiance of this restaurant! It is laidback and perfect for a casual dinner with friends or family. You can see the kitchen from your table which is entertaining. Additionally, there is a bar area.The price of my items (shrimp bun: $4.90 and Akamaru Shinaji ramen: $17) was slightly above average. However, the quality of the food and the good atmosphere makes the price worth it!"
782,"Great Ramen, amazing appetizers and buns. Must visit if you are in NYC for a cold weekend. Cheers!"
783,"Came on an early weekday night and had a good crowd with a wait time of 15 min. We had drinks while we waited at their small bar. The sake they had on tap was delightful.  We ordered the Aburi Unagiri, Kar-Age, Akamuri Ramen and Spicy Karaka Ramen. Everything was delicious and superb. The Kar-Age was so good that we had to order it again after we finished the first one in a second. The staff was friendly and helpful. The food came out fast."
784,We were quickly seated. Love the welcome when you are being seated. Service was quick and friendly! Never had an empty drink. We started with the pork buns which was so flavorful loved the sauces that was on them and the freshness of the lettuce. Next was the Shishito peppers. The salt added great flavor. We also ordered the Oishii Karaage with a trio of sauces. The honey mustard was my favorite but the Mentai mayo was a close second. Didn't care much for the guacamole. Lastly I got the Akamaru Shinaji. The ramen was very flavorful highly recommend! Wasn't a huge fan of the pork inside tho. Otherwise it's some of the best ramen you'll have in the states!
785,"My brother and I visited Ippudo for dinner 2 nights ago! Omg was completely blow away by how tasty and heavenly the ramen tasted. I love ramen a lot and have eaten pretty good ramen in my lifetime. We ordered the chicken buns (omg the softest buns ever, melts right away) , spicy ramen for me (this was the best) , lychee drink(very refreshing and yummy) and fried shishito peppers (was fine). Must visit. Highly recommend!"
786,"Since my last visit, I kinda didn't want to return. I found every dish of my last dinner, here, to have something wrong. The price tab wasn't cheap, so I thought I was done with the overhype of this place. Not quite. I returned last night with a friend and had a blast. It's entirely possible that they turned it around a while ago, but, for me, there's was a new menu, new inventive and enticing dishes and probably a new chef. This time, I couldn't find anything wrong with any of the dishes we ordered. Pork buns: very good. Shrimp buns: delicious. Karate: a sizable portion of perfectly fried chicken. Maybe add some sauce, would you?Hamachi carpaccio: it will melt in your mouth. Aburi Unagiri: ooooh... the eel... you can't miss this beautifully presented and quite perfect dish. Beef teppan: you won't believe how great the sauce is!Overall, yes... they're back to greatness. And I will be back soon."
787,"There's a reason this place has so many amazing reviews! We were seated right away. I ordered the Karaka Spicy ramen with chicken. It had a bit of a kick, but it wasn't too spicy. The broth was amazing!!! I highly recommend this place. It hits the spot!"
788,"Ippudo has been highly acclaimed and for good reason. It's made an impression on me ever since I first came into contact with their ramen in 2017. It was certainly the best ramen I had had until that point and is still one of the best ramen places I've had today. As a result, Ippudo has become my mind's immediate thought as soon as ramen is brought up, hanging out rent-free in my hippocampus. It's the place I would suggest to visitors right off the bat.I had made many visits to the Greenwich Village location and only one visit to this one. If my memory serves me right, the ramen quality is pretty consistent between the two.If you're looking for a reliable source for a rich concoction of perfectly textured noodles, this place is a great bet. Tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme, Ippudo Westside."
789,"The broth is so rich, so tasty, and grounds the entire dish. Noodles are ridiculously good. Our server strongly recommended the straight noodles over the wavy noodles, but they still had a delightful bounce and chew (without the advantage of the shape making space).Toppings are varied and all good, especially the bamboo shoots.Pork bun was okay. The pork in the noodles is better,We went early on when indoor dining was just becoming okay, early May 2021. They handled the situation and the seating tastefully."
790,"Got here around 11:45 and was able to be seated once my whole party arrived. The pork buns were really good- the sauce was tasty, the bun was soft, and the pork was flavorful. For ramen, we got the akamaru shinaji with pork chashu. It was pretty good and the broth was flavorful. Service was good as well!"
791,"Ippudo Westside Ratings: 4.6/5 Food: 4.75/5 - Had ramen many times at Ippudo other locations. The Akamaru ramen is delicious, the broth is rich, the pasta is unique, and super al dente chewy ramen noodles. They were very impressive and love how they are consistent at the other locations too. The Takoyaki is fried so amazingly, crispy outer layer with a gooey and doughy soft texture inside literally blew my mind. Super refresh and pipping hot when it came out topped with crispy tempura flakes. This is a MUST order. I decided to try the Chashu rice too. The chewy Japanese rice mixed with chicken and pork... topped with shredded lettuce and marinated pork slices was so BOMB. The mayo dressing was so good, I end up using all of it even though I requested for it on the side. Ambiance: 4.5/5 - Laidback vibe, cozy and nice atmosphere with an open kitchen. We sat near the middle bar area, so we can see the entire kitchen in operation. Honestly I love to be able to see the kitchen. The restaurant isn't loud, instead perfect setting for grabbing brunch and dinner for friends gathering and chat. Price: 4.25/5 - The takoyaki was $9 for 8 pieces, definitely worth it and a steal. The Chashu rice bowl was $12, and the portion was very small, and lastly the Akamaru ramen is around $17 with an okay size portion. The total came up to be around $50 for the two of us. Service: 4.75/5 - Wonderful and thoughtful service. Our server was good at explaining the menu to us and provided recommendations. She constantly come over to ask us if we were okay, and make sure our water is filled at all times. BLUF: This is a legit ramen place. Try it out if you haven't and make sure to get the takoyaki and the chashu rice in addition to the ramen. It's worth splurging at amazingly good ramen places."
792,Um I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this location!Delicious. Pork Belly Buns are like dessert. We tried a fizzy Sake that's as interesting and pleasant. They have a new and improved menu so I feel like I need to explore it!If you have children they provide child safe utensils which is awesome!
793,Great Ramen! Fresh and hot on a freezing cold day. Perfect first stop for quick NYC trip!
794,"Ippudo West is a very good choice to ramen in Hells Kitchen. When I want ramen I usually think Toto Ramen or Ippudo. The difference is simple: Toto is very casual, good ramen, limited menu; Ippudo is a tad fancier, pricier, better beer choices but the chances are you are gonna have to wait a bit until you get seated. Karaka men is my favorite ramen because it's the spiciest. I like to add a soft boiled egg on top. My friend likes to order wavy noodles instead of standard. Suntory premium beer is top notch but it's $12 although it's worth it. Finally pork buns for appetizer are so yum! You can order drinks in the bar area while you wait for your table."
795,"We went on a Saturday night around 5:30 and it was fairly crowded when we walked in so we were surprised the wait was only ~30 minutes for a party of 2. There is a bar by the entrance and we did have to wait about 10-15 minutes before the bartender showed up to take drinks but understandable since the place was bustling. I got the yuzu rita, which was super refreshing since it was fruity and mixed with shaved ice-- highly recommend. Bonus points for convenience because the bartender took our name and forwarded our drink order to our tab for dinner.We got seated at the bar area at the center of the restaurant, and were able to immediately order. We loved the ambiance of the restaurant. Even though it was super busy and crowded, there was something about the place that felt lively and cozy. I ordered the Karake Spicy with chicken shoyu and my friend got the soy based kimidori. The food came out very quickly.. I don't think it was even 10 minutes after we ordered. The Karake spicy was not as pretty to look at haha but the soup was so rich, fatty, and flavorful. Loved the bamboo shoots which added a crunchy texture. The kimidori was definitely a lighter soup if you prefer that. Service was quick and great, would definitely recommend for a date night or even an outing with family!"
796,"Often a long wait to get a table here but it is so very worth it! The ramen is simply amazing - rich broth, chewy noodles, and not too salty. I grew up in Tokyo and this ramen tastes like childhood, not exaggerating at all. My one qualm is that they barely give you any meat and I definitely would have expected more than 2 slivers of meat for the price.Though the buns are a popular appetizer here, I highly recommend trying the karaage! And if you are waiting in line for a table you should get a drink at the bar because the cocktails were shockingly good, I was pleasantly surprised that the cocktails we tried (Yuzu G&T, Crimson Lips) were better than cocktails I've had at expensive bars."
797,"This is only the 3rd outpost we've been to: Kyoto, San Francisco, and now New York City.So far NYC's is in first place.Both hubby & I thought the tonkatsu broth rich & hearty. The wavy noodles were cooked perfectly as was the pork chasu.We started with the karaage.  The boneless chicken was marinated and tender and it came to our table hot. We both had Japanese beer - Kirin & Sapporo.  Served in chilled glasses.Service was quick and efficient and our food was great."
798,"A friend of mine recommended this place and WOW. There are a lot of ramen places around, but I tend to come back here. The ambiance is quiet, cozy, upscale, and every dish I've had there has been delicious. The ramen broth is rich and the egg is a delight."
799,"I was super excited to try the famous ramen from Ippudo and although it wasn't bad it just wasn't all it was hyped up to be . The establishment itself is very small, the wait is super long and the food is good but not great, not mind blowing . I was expecting more , additionally they have Options for add ons but eggs are usually a ramen staple and Ippudo charges $3 for a boiled eggs ..... lol i cant .... won't be back . Go down a few more blocks to Kogane you'll be happier ! Ps - I paid my $3 for this egg lol"
800,"This spot was great! I loved the inside design, they had ac and fans so it was a comfortable temperature even with the heat wave outside. Our server was attentive and friendly and last but not least the food was delicious and portions were huge! I had:Thai iced teaSummer rollKea mao - shrimp Would definitely recommend for date night or outing with friends/family!"
801,"TLDR: solid Thai food at decently reasonable prices Came to Up Thai and really enjoyed my food here! We were seated immediately and the ambiance is so lovely (they even have hand sanitizer at every table!). We ordered the chicken satay and the curry puffs to start. I thought the chicken satay dipping sauce was delicious and the chicken was really tender. The chicken curry puffs were also delicious - the interior flavor was so savory and the outside was so flakey. Love that combo.For my main, I ordered the crab fried rice and they don't skimp on the crab meat! Would definitely recommend although the actual fried rice was a bit plain - would've wanted a bit more flavor. The Thai iced tea I got was pretty standard - nothing too special but still delicious!"
802,"I really enjoyed my Soft Shell Crab mango salad earlier this week. I brought my dog and we sat outside on a nice 80 degree weather day. The soft shell crab was cooked to perfection, seasoned well and had a light but crispy exterior. Up Thai is situated just 2 blocks from another phenomenal Thai restaurant so it's always so hard to choose which one to go to. Ultimately, I eat at both. But maybeeee eat here at Up Thai a little more often because they don't close mid day like the other restaurant does. Shutting down at 3:45pm and reopening at 5pm doesn't work for my schedule and luckily Up Thai doesn't do that and stays open, hooray!Menu is also quite extensive, lots of different flavor profiles and vegetarian options to choose from. Service is also excellent. Come!!!"
803,One of the best Thai tea I've ever had. The curry and deep-fried spring roll were also delicious. The only drawback of this place is that you might sit pretty close to other groups. Other than that
804,"I will definitely have to come back here and try more items but the lunch special garlic chicken was really just okay. The flavor was on the boring side and just was not memorable at all. The lunch special comes with your choice of side which can be a soup, salad or spring roll. I had the spring roll and that was decent. I'll be back for sure to try other items on their menu."
805,Yummy food. Good service. Very popular place. Overall great experience. I would definitely come again.
806,"This is my favorite go to hands down - food is always delicious and very reasonably priced. I order takeout from here at least once per week and have been a customer for the past several years. I am coming here to write a complaint for a situation that I have never before experienced.... I went to up Thai last night and thought I got WAY less food than usual. We wanted to order in (like we usually do on Sundays, after I complete my long runs for marathon training bc up Thai is a significant amount of food), but the restaurant was so busy that they weren't taking take out orders, so I thought, ""why not just go in?""I had just run 20 miles so obviously I was dying of starvation and requested extra veggies with my panang curry (also specifically ordered this dish because it's a significant portion of food). When the meal arrived, it seemed like way less than I typically get both dining in and with takeout (especially considering the extra veg request). I ate it nonetheless (practically licking the plate at the end... And was still hungry lol).However when the check came, we noticed that my meal had not only a ""tofu"" and ""extra veg"" designation but also a ""lady"" descriptor....... Does that mean you're giving females less food?? Just because I'm a 5'0"" small woman does not mean I need less food, this is so incredibly sexist!! Once again I had just finished running 20 miles (and I do about 75 per week) so I needed my nourishment. Super disappointed that I didn't get a full meal and came home hungry, and sad that I was profiled as a ""lady"" eater when I routinely eat 2x more than my six foot tall boyfriend....I guess we will just have to stick to takeout to satisfy my hunger and dine elsewhere."
807,"Love upThai .Came for dinner and drinks on a Friday night with my girlfriend.  We both got the passionfruit mojito, and it's delicious.Table seated outside was a bit slanted; our cups kept sliding. But we managed, it's what you have to deal with the outdoor seating. It was warm enough though with heaters on a November evening.We got the sumilan curry, pad Thai and mussels.The mussels are a bit tangier than what you would see as ""white wine mussels"" at American places.  Bit of the Thai spices.Loved their pad thai."
808,Ordered take away and picked up. The food here was so good maybe some of the best Thai foodI have had in Manhattan. I am already making plans to do outdoor dining here! Ordered their pad Thai it was delicious!
809,"My favorite Thai restaurant on the UES. I order from here roughly once a week for delivery. Everything I've tried on the menu is amazing. I really love the dumplings, pad se ew and the red curry. Their delivery is usually super quick (never takes the quoted time) and arrives hot. I finally visited in person - be aware that you absolutely need to make a reservation and the whole party needs to be present before they'll seat you. Even with a reservation we needed to wait 10-15 minutes outside. When we finally we seated, the service was a bit slow and some of the dishes came out a full 15 minutes after others. The food was worth it though. So delicious!"
810,Great food.  We order from there at least once per week.  I usually get the rice and noodle dishes like basil fried rice or pad Thai.  Cannot go wrong with either.
811,"I went to New York a about 2 months ago and stumbled upon Up Thai. Personally, I felt that the feel was average and could have definitely been more seasoned. However, I would have to say that the place is very clean and very nicely decorated. I love that they had QR codes for the menu to minimize contact. The servers were nice and attentive, but I can't justify going to a place solely because they have nice staff."
812,"This is the best Thai place I have ever been to; that says a lot considering it's one of my favorite types of food. We ordered the crispy spring rolls, Pad Thai, tofu Pad Se-Ew, and the Tofu Curry family style, and they were all delicious. The tofu Pad Se-Ew was my favorite; super savory and the thick noodles are so yummy. I wish the rice that came with the curry was more plentiful or was complimentary if a refill was needed, but overall very delicious. The atmosphere itself was lovely and the service was attentive. I went back and ordered another Pad Se-Ew for my flight back home the last day I was there. 10/10"
813,Great experience overall here! Our server was friendly and accommodating. Even gave us some chairs to sit along the sidewalk to people watch while we waited. Got to catch a glimpse of the fixie bicycle gang ride through.Food: 5.0 of 5.0Service: 5.0 of 5.0Ambiance: 4.5 of 5.0Food was delicious! Good level of spicy with a Medium request. Everything tastes fresh and made to order. Great variety of flavors. Highly recommend ordering one of the fried rice.
814,Recommended by a friend. I liked almost everything about the place esp the spice level. They made the kea mao just the way I like it!  they take the pandemic seriously (which I appreciate) as there's partitions between each table. I just didn't like the fact that we felt rushed but I understood why once I left. There were lots of people waiting to dine.
815,"**Pre-COVID Review**You must have a reservation for this popular Thai restaurant on 2nd Ave. They serve classic Thai dishes in a rustic dining room with Persian lanterns, and floral accents hanging from the ceiling. Very interesting decor that somehow makes the place romantic for a date night. The food is delightful with a superb balance of authentic Thai flavors and spice level. My favorite dish was the clay pot ($17) comprising of sea scallop, shrimp, chicken, onion, scallions and mushrooms - it also comes with Chinese sausage but I asked without it for dietary reasons. Looking forward to a date night here once the pandemic is over!"
816,"Stopped at Up Thai for a quick bite around 1:45pm today and were seated indoors right away.  They have plexiglass partitions set up between tables, check your temperature, have customers fill out a quick questionnaire for contact tracing, and provide hand sanitizer.  The staff is all masked and extremely welcoming.  We felt very safe dining here.  I love Up Thai.  We've never had a bad meal here and the decor of the restaurant is cozy, inviting and classic.  I love looking at their beautiful glass lighting fixtures, such a colorful and unique detail.  There are a lot of vegetarian options. I wasn't all that hungry so just ordered the Papaya Salad, which is always a Thai favorite of mine.  Up Thai's version is perfect, sweet, sour, salty, spicy, and crunchy.  All the vegetables are fresh and the flavor is spot on.  They use fish sauce in this dish so not vegetarian but I'm a flexitarian although mostly plant based so this doesn't bother me.  I did request the pork rinds on the side in case the Hubby wanted to eat them, neither one of us touched them.  Hubby ordered the Chicken Pad Thai, a reliable and predictable dish of his at any Thai restaurant.  He says Up Thai does it well.  Overall, we always enjoy our experience at Up Thai and will be returning next time we're in the neighborhood!"
817,"Up Thai is fantastic! The food is so delicious, and portions are gigantic - make sure you wear pants with an elastic waist.Seriously though, Thai food is a staple throughout the city. Hard to mess up, but also hard to knock out of the park. So it's particularly impressive that Up Thai manages to set itself apart with quality dishes.The curry was spot on - great flavor, the perfect level of spice for those of us that like heat, and a consistency that let you know you were having curry, not watered down coconut milk.And the pad kee mao was just as impressive, the only reason to not clean your plate is the sheer amount of food that comes with each entree.If you'd like some quality Thai food that's a cut above the usual takeout comfort food, Up Thai is definitely worth a visit."
818,This is the best Thai food in NYC. It reminds me of my time in Thailand. Food is absolutely delicious. This place is busy so make sure to add yourself to the wait list as you early as you can (There is a wait list on the yelp button). This is my go to place when I am considering Thai food.  You won't regret it. My latest food crave with Up Thai is their Red Curry.
819,Best Thai restaurant in an area where there are a few very good ones. Just be careful when ordering if you don't like things spicy. Food and service are both really good and the room is nice. A fantastic local staple.
820,"Overall, this place had really good food and a great ambience! I got drunken noodles (kee mao), my friends got another noodle dish, and it was great all around. The interior was decorated very nicely and this is a great place to come for a date or with friends. My one complaint is we made a reservation on the phone but when we got there they said we did not make a reservation, even though I called the right number. We still were able to get seated even though it was very busy. This is a great place to go on the UES and I recommend it!"
821,"I was at Up Thai several years ago and remembered loving the food, but for some reason forgot to review.  Came back today with my friend and the food and service was just as lovely as I remembered.  My friend started off with a lychee martini and I had a Thai iced tea, which was very tasty and refreshing on a warm day.  For our mains we both got something we never had, which was called Nam Tok.  This was a sliced sirloin steak salad with coconut sticky rice in a Thai Chile lime sauce.  We both found this to be very flavorful and delicious and would definitely get it again.  Well to be honest I'd probably get my favorite pad see ew, but I'm happy I got to try something different.  Our waitress was as sweet and accommodating as could be and the bus boys were very efficient without being intrusive.  Really do enjoy coming here!"
822,Came to Up Thai after spending the afternoon at The Met. We got seated right away during a busy lunch time. We had the lunch specials that came with soup and salad. We ordered the wings which was cooked well. The pad Thai was delicious with a generous amount of meat which I always appreciate. Service was fast and with a smile. The dishes didn't feel too greasy like some other Thai places. All seasoned nicely and equally.
823,"This is the best place for Thai food on the UES!!Portion sizes are generous and delicious and spice levels are always appropriate. I have never finished an entire dish here in one sitting and always end up taking half home in a takeout container to enjoy the next day. If you come here for dine-in during lunch, they have a really good deal with a soup/salad, appetizer, and entree for under $20. The decor is delightful both inside and out. The Moo Dang dish in particular has a lot of different types of meat! Service is always good, despite the waitstaff being so busy with all the customers I always see here. This is a solid place for a casual date or a dinner with a group of friends, as the menu has a lot of variety to accommodate everyone!"
824,"Left the table extremely stuffed and satisfied. All the dishes were on point with both flavor and seasoning.  great option when craving Thai food! Prices were reasonable as well for such large portions. The only thing I'll say is that I was surprised to see the Kra Paw in a different form of meat. It's usually ground meat but this came in chunkier cuts of pork. While I would've preferred the ground meat, the flavors and sauce were still on point. I'm actually wondering if our server may have just gotten the order wrong, but in light of this our meal and service was still 5s!"
825,"Stopped by for dinner for the first time on a Friday night and was disappointed. I ordered the Nam Tok since it was a recommended dish but it arrived quite cold, and the steak was over cooked and dry. It was very late when I ordered so perhaps this was the last of the ingredients for the night. I really do feel this was an exception since there are tons of positive reviews and the place was busy. However, I messaged the business directly twice to inform them, rather than post this review, but did not receive any follow up."
826,"Stopped in for an early dinner and cocktails tonight. Service was prompt and everything was delicious! We had the Matcha Beekeeper and the Thai Tea made with rum. Cocktails were strong and unique. For food, we had the of service ewe and pad kee mao--both were very flavorful."
827,"I came here when I was in New York a few weeks back and this place was BUSY! Be sure to grab a reservation, because both indoor and outdoor seating was full and a long wait. Service at Up Thai was nicely paced and great! I ordered the Massaman Curry with chicken and it was soooooo flavorful and just yummy. They were able to get such a great depth of flavor into it! Rice comes on the side which I do love. My friend ordered the Crab Fried Rice and really loved it!"
828,"Up Thai is the perfect place to go when you're looking for a delicious and unique Thai meal. The restaurant is small, but the atmosphere is cozy and inviting. The menu is extensive and includes a variety of traditional Thai dishes as well as some unique creations that you won't find anywhere else. The food is fantastic, and the prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend Up Thai for a delicious and authentic Thai meal."
829,"Trendy - popular - packed! But I can see why. The food here is amazing. The ingredients are top notch, fresh, and flavorful. The service was a bit slow but they were swamped. The menu is epic, a lot to choose from. Overall a great experience and one I would love to repeat."
830,I had the tie dye pizza and the kale sausage cavetelli.  The food was hot and pick up was very easy.
831,"Still as good as ever!This place was jam packed in the evening. Pizzas are so good - that vodka sauce is out of this world. Still thinking about that crust. I took an out-of-towner here and they were impressed. Our arugula salad was surprisingly delicious as well. Service was great.Again, reservations are the way to go if you don't want to wait too long, although can try your luck walking in at the bar.No NYC pizza tour can be complete without Rubirosa on the list."
832,"You should definitely make reservations before coming and it might be a little hard to get reservations. It is worth the effort though as this is definitely one of the better pizza places in NYC. They let you customize your pizza by ordering half of one pie and half of another. We got the Rubirosa supreme, tie-dye and honey pie, they were all good and my personal favorite was the Rubirosa supreme. The Black & White Tagliatelle was surprisingly spicy. Small pie is 14"" Large pie is 18"" and generally a small pie is around 25-30 dollars and a large pie is around 30-35 dollars.Food: 4.5/5Value: 4.5/5Service: 4/5"
833,"Okay, so the pizza was great. Service wasn't so much. I ordered the pizza online and it gave me an expected wait time of an hour. I showed up in an hour and waited another 30 minutes in the cold.The pizza itself is great! It's crispy and very saucy if that's what you like! As in, Its more saucy than cheesy. I got the tie dye pizza with roasted peppers.Overall good food, but since it's over hyped the wait-times might be off by a lot."
834,"Highly Recommended!  WOW, so awesome and authentic in every way! I came in on a rainy spring Monday evening and it was packed with a vibrant crowd but I was still able to get a seat at the bar for a quick meal.  Quite simply this was one of the best meals I've had in the NOLITA neighborhood near the heart of Little Italy.  I decided to order a few apps versus a single plate which was great and still way too much food!  I had the Eggplant Parmigiano, Grandma's Braciole (like my mom would make ), and an Arugula salad. Each plate was SUPERB making for an outstanding and memorable meal. The super attentive bartender was so on her game as my server too. Leaving after dinner there was a long line of people waiting in the drizzle which is a great testimony of being worth the wait!  This is a must-hit destination for me henceforth!  Thanks for a great meal and experience!"
835,"Overall 5/5: Super enjoyable and delicious. Loved everything about this place. The food, the drinks, and the service. Drinks 5/5: I had the frosé which was great. Great for a sunny day like it was; especially since we were sitting outside. Food 5/5: We started with the mozzarella sticks which came with this great sauce! It complemented the dish well and had this awesome spicy kick to it. Loved it! For mains we all shared the vodka sauce pizza and the rubirosa supreme. I enjoyed the crust and the sauce on both. The flavoring was great for all of them. We also had to try the pasta and were not disappointed. We ordered the cavatelli; it was melt in your mouth amazing. It was delicate and delicious. Service 5/5: Nothing to complain about, our server recommended great options and food came our promptly. He was very quick to clear empty plates even though it seemed he was pretty busy. Vibe 5/5: Didn't get much of a look inside, but we were seated outside and it was decorated very cute. I loved sitting outside especially for how the weather was that day. The set up of everything was so cute. Thank you, Rubirosa!"
836,"First time ever in this place. Didn't even know such a place existed. Arrived on a Tuesday night around dinner time and waited 30 mins for a table. They will put you anywhere they can fit you whether it be outside, inside, or at the bar. So there is no seat preference. We got placed outside and it wasn't bad. The heating lamps did a really good job and I thought that I was gonna get sunburned on my foreheadGot the small pie (6 slices) half vodka and and rubirosa supreme and split that with my wife. I love thin crust but this is next level thin. The parts with the sauce were sooo thin that the sauce made it soggy and the toppings were too heavy for it. Sauces were good. I liked the rubirosa supreme better but was a little challenging to eat and was forced to fold my slice in half (I'm normally not a pizza folder)The carbonara (small) was pretty good as well. Comes with raw egg yolk and you need to stir it in yourself. It was salty and creamy which is what you would expect. I felt like I could've 2 bited the whole pasta dish"
837,"We (attempted) to start off with the tie dye pizza but the kitchen messed up and send out our pasta first. I had a double order of the vodka sauce, which was very good. Added parmigiana was not offered, but available upon request. My friend had the rigatoni, and it also looked good. The tie dye pizza was good, but not DYING over it, the crust was thin and crispy. For drinks I had a Moscow mule, and they accidentally sent out a specialty cocktail which they let me keep the second one, which was nice. For dessert we had the cannoli, which was surprisingly very good- I have high dessert standards and expected this to taste commercial but it tasted very homemade. We also had a chocolate cake, which was OK. Our server was extremely friendly, but the kitchen doesn't have it together if they can't fire an appetizer and entree correctly."
838,WOW. The vodka sauce here is amazing. Two weeks later and I am still dreaming of it. I was expecting for the pizza to be soggy since it's thin but boy to my surprise it was perfectly crispy. We tried 4-5 different pizza places on our trip to NYC and rubirosa was definitely in the top 2! Great customer service as well!
839,"I've been trying to get a reservation here for over a year and had no luck. My friend and I walked by Rubirosa Saturday and thought maybe we should try our luck. The brunch god was on our side and we managed to get a table with only 5 mins wait! We got the rigatoni pasta and tie dye pizza. Pasta was a tiny bit undercooked, 30 more seconds in the water would've been perfect. My friend thought the pasta was a bit salty but I personally thought it was perfect. Tie dye pizza was a vodka sauce with pesto on top, we both thought the pizza was absolutely delicious! Overall, I'm coming back for more pasta and pizza!"
840,"If you go or live in NYC and don't come here, I feel so sorry for you. This was seriously THE best Italian food I've ever had. If you are visiting NYC, I recommend you get both pizza and pasta dishes. You have to try both, there's no middle ground here. We started off with the Arugula salad. It came with fresh arugula, tomato, ricotta and lemon vinaigrette. It was extremely tasty and refreshing. I highly recommend some sort of salad or vegetable dish because it really brings the entire meal together once the pizza and pasta come out. For the mains, we went with the classic. A SMALL is 14"" so keep that in mind. Whether it's the delicious, melted hot mozzarella or the homemade tomato sauce or the crispy yet soft pizza crust, this was by the far one of the best meals I've had in my life. For the pasta, we went with the simpler option and got a Roman Cacio e Pepe. I think I cried happy tears while eating this dish. Yeah, it was literally THAT GOOD. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the cheesy, creamy, and peppery sauce was incredible. I highly recommend you come here. This is definitely a bucket list type restaurant."
841,"Very cozy spot in little italy; one of those places you wish wasn't famous so you can swing by whenever you want. We got:- mushroom campanelle 10/10: the waiter told us this was his favorite and it was so delicious!!! Never had these kinds of mushrooms in pasta before and that with the garlic sauce was remarkable. We got a large but it's definitely not really enough for one person (or maybe i eat a ridiculous amount of pasta?)- rubirosa supreme 9/10: the sauce was phenomenal! Toppings and dough were great as well but the sauce still stands out. (It even reheats well, we only finished half of a large)."
842,"Overhyped and terrible service, the food wasn't that good and the service was even worse. Our server Jonathan gave a little to no service offer our food was ordered and water was put on our table and had to wait 25 min after the fact just to pay In retrospect I left my hat and he did grab it for me before I left; thus one star service and food Three star experience"
843,"We always have to stop for pizza when in NYC and this was our choice on our most recent trip. We made the rookie mistake of not making a reservation and they were fully booked, so we couldn't eat there. I did find it a little strange that it was at least half empty, but oh well. We ordered take out and ate on the street instead. It took about 30 minutes for it to be ready. We got a small pizza, half Tie-Dye and half Honey Pie. I love that they let you do half and half! We got the Tie-Dye because it seemed to be the most popular, but I thought the Honey Pie was better. Next time I'd try the Vodka. The small pizza was still pretty big, but with the thin crust my husband and I still finished it. This is a great spot to go for pizza in NYC, just make reservations ahead of time!"
844,"The best pizza I've ever had.The Tie-dye Pie is out of this world. Thin crust. Pesto. Vodka sauce. Tomatoes. And fresh mozzarella. The flavors are amazing together.We also got a cacio e pepe. It was good. Really good. But honestly, the pizza is all I can think about.We had to wait about 30 mins....but we're originally told and hour. We just strolled around the neighborhood and checked out the shops. Honestly, even if it would have been a full hour it would have been worth it.I'll stop here whenever I'm in NYC."
845,"Rubirosa is best known for their tie dye pizza, and it is 100% worth the long wait times and price tag. The vodka sauce on the tie dye pizza is what dreams are made of. The crust is thin and crispy, and there's a gluten free version of the pizza for all those with celiac.I haven't ordered many things off the pasta menu, but I should because it is a completely under-appreciated part of the menu."
846,"SHEEEEEEESH! is the easiest way to describe this absolute gem. Rubirosa really does it right in the realm of BOTH pasta and pizza which, I've realized from many years of frequenting Italian restaurants, isn't always easy to pull off. I absolutely love that they allow you to order half-split pizzas and get smaller portions of the pasta dishes so you can sample more even with a small party of 2. It's genius. Their pasta was perfect - al dente and not overly busy or complicated - it really let the flavours of the dishes shine. The vodka rigatoni is a must try - the sauce is next level creamy-rich goodness. We stepped out of our comfort zone with the cacio e pepe and were not disappointed - I'm not particularly partial to black pepper but man, the combination of black pepper and pecorino was divine. The real star of the show for me is always pizza (duh), and they hit the mark and then some with both the tie-dye and Rubirosa supreme. If you like a thin, crispy crust, you truly can't be disappointed. The flavours of the tie dye really do live up to the hype described by other reviewers here and the Rubirosa supreme is a classic done tremendously well. I left here with a happy (albeit very full) belly, full-on googly eyes and deeply wishing this was a neighbourhood joint back home. I've seen some comments about folks having a hard time getting in and definitely recommend making a reservation via Resy. Their website indicates resos open up 7 days in advance but I couldn't see any dates for 7 days out when we looked, so I called and they were able to book me in via Resy over the phone!"
847,"My only negative take with my visit to Rubirosa was one of the hostesses skipping past our name to seat another party of two...after we had waited thirty minutes and watched the couple walk in and be seated immediately. Was the hostess apologetic? Nope. Did another hostess seat us quickly afterwards? Yes. It took a couple of zen moments, but it was smooth sailing afterwards with nothing but good service and food to follow.    We opted to share a small Tie-Dyed pizza and lunch portion Rubirosa Carbonara. The Carbonara was first, presented with the yolk intact for me to mix. I only wish I waited for the photo, but my wife had a hunger headache and it looked to good to wait with its generous portion of speck calling to me. The pasta was deliciously satisfying...tasting as good as it looked. Their pizza has an almost razor thin crust and comes well done as I'm not sure it's possible to be otherwise as thin as it is. The Tie-Dye was pretty good, with quite a sweet note due to the vodka sauce.It's not the best pizza I've ever had, but I'd definitely recommend it to friends...and I would strongly suggest that they must not overlook the pasta. I'll be back, even if it was just for the Carbonara."
848,"LOVE the Tie-Dye Pizza and Ceasar salad here! I've also had the Rubirosa salad, Honey Pie Pizza and seasonal Brussels Sprouts Pizza, all of which are definitely runner-ups.  Recently I came on a Wednesday around 7pm and was able to grab two seats through walk-in. Note that Rubirosa takes reservations but not same-day reservations.  Staff is attentive and quick.  Such a NYC staple!"
849,"Of all the pizzerias in NYC and the world, this had to be my favorite pizza of all time. This is the quintissential new york style pizza that I could eat everyday of the week. This is the #1 spot I would recommend to anyone that's visiting NYC for the first time. I would recommend reservations for the evening since it gets really busy, we decided to come back the next day for lunch on a weekday and had no problem getting a seat indoors. There's no good way to describe the pizza here to justify how delicious it is,  you just have to try it."
850,"Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant in Nyc. It's a smaller restaurant so make sure to call ahead and make reservations, otherwise be prepared for a bit of a wait. The tie dye pizza is amazing and very instagramable. Generous portions of chicken parm that you can easily share between 1-2 people"
851,"I came here for my birthday dinner. I tried to make a reservation a couple of days before my birthday but they said they only take reservations a week in advance which is quite bizarre to me. We waited for nearly two hours which is probably the longest I've ever waited to eat at a restaurant. We started off with gluten free mozzarella sticks and calamari. Mozzarella sticks were standard and good. Calamari is a bang for your buck cause you get so much. I'd already gotten full after eating half of the calamari. I got the vongole which was pretty delicious - just wish they gave me more clams. There was more pasta than clams. Flavor was good and lemony, I stole some of my friend's pizza spices to add extra ""oomph"" to my dish. I had a slice of the Brussels sprouts pizza and it was amazing. Loved every bite of it! I think it's a seasonal dish so I highly recommend getting it before it's off the menu. My friends asked the waiter for a birthday dessert and we had assumed that they would give it to us for free because that's usually the case. It wasn't. We were charged $14 and were quite upset that our server didn't give us a heads up that it wouldn't be free. We told another waiter that we were upset about it so he gave us 50% off our dessert. Service is ok, food is pretty great.Will I come back? Yes, to get more Brussels sprouts pizza."
852,"Came here with a group for dinner and had a set menu.. everything was so good. Cute little romantic restaurant! I heard they're known for their tie dye pizza but I didn't think it was anything too special. The little puffy donut desserts however, that's another story. My husband who isn't a sweets fan was obsessed with these little morsels. Definitely a fun spot to try if you're in the area."
853,"My sister has Celiac disease so I'm always looking for restaurants with gluten free options and came across Rubirosa. They have a dedicated gluten free menu which is hard to find in Italian restaurants. A lot of places will have a gluten free pasta option or pizza crust but an entire menu is unreal. We started with the Caesar salad and I'm not even exaggerating, it's the best Caesar I've ever had. Didn't love the gluten free mozzarella sticks but still fun that she got to have some after 15 years of being gluten free.The pasta. Wow. I had the regular Rigatoni Alla Vodka and it was super flavorful, rich, and fresh. My sister had the gluten free chicken parm which was a 10/10. Can't wait to come back!"
854,"Get the tie-dye pizza and thank me later. I'm always tempted to try the other pizzas and whenever I do, I always regret ever turning my back on the beloved tie-dye, my one true pizza love!Tie-dye over everything !!!!"
855,Amazing ambience and great food. Their pizza is a very thin and crispy crust. Good portions as you would expect for pastas but you can get a small pizza to share and won't be too stuffed. Hard to get a reservation but highly recommend.
856,"Stopped in here on day 2 of a 4 day trip to New York from SF. First of all I loved the small town pizzeria/Italian eatery vibe. Sat down and ordered the Ceasar salad, vodka sauce pizza and octopus. Ceasar salad was just right, I wouldn't say extraordinary, but it was really good. The octopus we ordered no really knowing what to expect and it was beyond any potential expectations. The dish was bigger sized tentacles that were crispy on the outside (almost a char type flavor) but perfectly cooked on the inside. Came with some pickled veggies like cauliflower and carrots (which I wish had a bit more because they were so good), a sauce that I was very light but worked perfectly with it. Now for the star of the show, the vodka sauce pizza and I am glad my girlfriend and I ordered the large. It was delicious, thin crust with a creamy, fragrant, tasty sauce and the right amount of cheese. Overall great vibes, atmosphere, food and service. Looking for a good date night spot or something with a home-y feel I would definitely head on over here."
857,"After eating here..., I understand why people are waiting in line before the restaurant opens. Let me tell you how psycho (including myself) people are. So if you don't know, resos open up 7 days in advance. So around Sunday morning at around 12:30 AM I was casually remembered to book a reso for the following Saturday. They were already fully booked and it had been open for 30 minutes! I thought the website was broken so called that afternoon and they confirmed everything was all booked. I thought ok no biggie I can try tonight and book for lunch on Sunday. I set my alarm for midnight and booked lunch right away for 12 pm. Once I booked and refreshed the website the only available times left were for dinner. Success!Not gonna lie, I felt really cool skipping the long line and going straight to the host stand to be seated. We started with calamari which was incredible! Cooked to perfection, not rubbery. We ordered a large pizza that was half tie dye and half classic with pepperoni. There were three of us and we had two slices left over so it's good for parties 3-4. That first bite of my pizza was heaven. That vodka sauce is a game changer. You HAVE to order the tie dye, even if you don't like pesto, it might change your mind. I've always been a pasta over pizza girl but this has been one of the best pizzas I've ever had. Like seriously, look at my picture. Make sure you book a reservation or else you'll be sorry!"
858,"Me and my boyfriend shared a small vodka pizza and added ricotta and mushroom with it. Very tasty pizza! Although we ordered a small, it left us both feeling full. They also offer free bread, so I guess that helped us feeling more full. We were seated right away when we came around 5 pm on a Wednesday night."
859,"At $24, the short rib agnolotti was comically small. When I first opened up my delivery order, I scoffed out loud at the ~10 pieces of pasta I saw that barely covered the bottom of the takeout container. Also, the sauce was wayyyyy too salty, which was a damn shame because I could tell the flavors were otherwise really good. Overall, Rubirosa was unfortunately a disappointment. I'd go in person to check out their famous pizza, but will def not be ordering pasta from them again!"
860,"If you like this place we can't be friends First off. The host was sort of off-putting and gave us really bad seats. Then she gave the party after us these nice open seats. What? They got our pizza order wrong and forgot to put pesto on the tie dye. And it was the most expensive out of Joes or prince street. They are stingy with the sauce, which was pretty bad. The dough was thin, but hard to hold and lacked depth. Just go to prince street and order takeout on like Uber eats or something. This place has the most below average pizza."
861,Well worth the wait. It took about 1 hour to get seated for 2 on a Sunday evening. We ordered a small cacio e pepe and 14-inch half and half pizza with the Tie Dye and Honey. All of it was incredible and more than enough for the two of us. Ended the evening with the strawberry cheesecake which was to die for.
862,"I would like to give a shoutout to Mikey Chen (strictlydumpling) for recommending Rubirosa. I finally was able to check it out on my trip to New York and oh boy, it did not disappoint! My fam and I had reservations for 4 on a Sunday afternoon and were able to get seated earlier than our reservation. We ordered a caesar salad (delicious). and a large 1/2 tie dye and 1/2 vodka w/ pepperoni. The crust was perfectly thin and crispy. The vodka sauce was soo good, great creamy tomato flavor. I actually preferred it over the tie dye which has a mix of tomato, vodka, and pesto sauce. It is so good that it's going to go back on my list for when I return to NYC. Overall probably my favorite pizza I got in NY... and I got a lot of pizza lol. Definitely a must."
863,"Overall decent place-came here for the pizza cause everyone raves about it but I think it was my least favorite thing we got out of everything we ordered. For starters, getting a reservation here for dinner is pretty much impossible. When you go on resy, reservations are already gone the night they open up. Good luck trying to get a hold of someone when you call cause I left several messages with no luck. Someone was nice enough to respond to an email I had sent, but the turnaround time was 2-3 days later and at that point dinner reservations were already booked per the employee. The inside is also not as big as you think it is, but these are all logistics. Onto the food!Since I tried to get a resy and couldn't, we put our names on the waitlist at 6 pm and waited roughly an hour for a table. We knew exactly what we wanted when we were sat down so we ordered everything at once. We got the calamari for an appetizer and it was delicious, but we definitely needed more marinara sauce. They don't give you much sauce for the amount of calamari you get. It was really hard getting our waitress's attention since she was so busy, so we flagged down anyone we could find. We eventually got our marinara but it took an additional 10 minutes after asking for it. We wanted the Sunday special, but they were already sold out by the time we ordered so instead we got the rigatoni which our waitress said was the next closest thing, and then we got the vongole. I really enjoyed the pastas. They were cooked well and the large size was good for sharing. For the pizza we did half tie-dye and half supreme. The pizza was good but does get cold fast only cause it's a really thin crust, but the crust itself was inedible cause it was hard as a rock. Out of all the pizza we had in NY, it was my least favorite.For dessert, we had the tiramisu which was ok as well. It wasn't the best so you could do without it if you're stuffed from pizza and pasta.Overall an ok experience. It wasn't in my list of favorites but if you're willing to wait in line then give it a try."
864,"So goooood! Only knocked off 1 star because felt the service was a bit slow. The pasta came out really fast but we waited quite some time for the pizza (and it wasn't busy inside at all). Highly recommend getting the Rigatoni and the Tie Dye pizza. The Rigatoni was perfectly al-dente and the sauce was amazing. I liked the Tie-Dye over the Honey pizza, hands down. Felt the Honey pizza was too salty, which was surprising given it's name (expected it to be a sweeter pizza). The Tie Dye sauce is thinner, but it works with the nature of NY style pizza (thin crust). The pesto is a great balance to the tomato."
865,"We snagged a last minute reservation for a Tuesday night - highly recommend having a reservation, being willing to sit/eat at the bar, or being patient. The place was jam-packed and they were down a server leaving 3 servers for 30 tables ... but you'd never know - our service (shout out: Dan and the amazing team of bussers) was stellar. We always had a full pitcher of water, a bonus plate of bread, our food came quickly, and we left stuffed. Pizza was extra yummy and the kitchen made a plain bowl of noodles with butter for a young diner (thank you!). It was the perfect Little Italy experience - charm, character, insanely good food, and the only cheese was alllll the fresh mozzarella. Definitely a great experience and a place we'll be back to."
866,"It's been a minute since I've been back here and I'm updating my review to a 5 star!!We got their Cesar salad, rigatoni alla vodka and their tie-dye pizza. Classic Cesar done well. The pasta was what made me want to give another star though. The sauce was really good and the pasta was al dente. Tie dye pizza was of course delicious as always. As we were leaving someone ordered the fried calamari and it looked and smelled amazing. Definitely coming back to try more pastas and that calamari haha"
867,"Holy crap this might be the best pizza I've ever had.  Specifically in regards to their vodka pizza. The honey one was also good but not the best honey pizza I've had, the meat they chose was just a little to overpowering for my taste. The crust is thin crispy perfection. If you can't decide on one option then you can ask for a pizza that's half and half. I want to go back and try the tie dye but I'm not convinced it'll be better than the plain vodka tbh, sometimes less is more. Be prepared for a wait if you come at a normal dinner hour. I came by myself at 9 30 pm on a Monday and still had to wait 5 mins for a spot at the bar to clear up."
868,"Not ready to share this with the world.. but this is THE best pizza in NYC if you like thin crust crispy dough. Skip the meat and do yourself a favor and order a whole pie of the tie-dye vodka pizza. My party of two wanted to try more items on the menu so we did a half of the tie-dye and half the rubirosa supreme in large of course. We also ordered the tiramisu, it was good and not super sweet, but have had better elsewhere. Can do without the tiramisu. Overall, the company and the food made my day!"
869,Can't decide what was better - my tie die pizza or my adorable server with a cute accent. Will forever be cemented as the best pizza place out there!
870,"I was dying to get a reservation here for a double date! I had initially wanted to come here a few months ago, but I wasn't thinking and didn't have a reservation, so I was not able to get seated. This time, I was smart enough to get a reservation! They only take reservations up to one week before your desired reservation. My table ordered the caesar salad, eggplant parmesan, fresca pizza (with anchovies and meatballs), and the rubirosa supreme pizza. A small pizza is enough to feed 2 hungry people or one extremely hungry and talented eater. The salad is larger than you expect it to be, so we had plenty to go around the table of 4. I didn't finish the eggplant parmesan there, but it was just as delicious the next day.Overall, plan your meal smart, and get a reservation in advance! There were lots of people waiting outside for quite some time, and the only thing worse than waiting for a table is waiting while you're hungry! I'll definitely be coming back here in the future."
871,"Have been here multiple times pre Covid and during and it's always amazing. The tie dye pizza is excellent every time, and the sneaky pro tip is to get the arancini. Famous spot with awesome pizza every time, great place to bring visitors."
872,"Rubirosa has consistently been my favorite place to get NY style pizza precovid so this was the first time visiting after what feels like forever and it felt so good to be reunited!+Vodka pizza: This is where it's at. The flavors are so simple yet flavorful and the simplicity of it gets me every time. Just know that Rubirosa gets their pizza ultra thin, to the point that it almost feels like you're eating a thin crispy cracker with sauce and cheese on it. But the fold factor was still there and ultra thin pizza just means more slices to eat! +Roasted octopus: I love when octopus is done right since it can get quite tough when overcooked, but Rubirosa you nailed it again! The roasted octopus was perfectly charred on the outside and the inside was so tender that it felt like a dream. The crispy potatoes and creamy sauce contrasted nicely with the octopus. Definitely a must try! +Mozzarella sticks: What's not to love when it's fried cheese! Plus the cheese pull was perfect and the marinara sauce had a slight kick, which I enjoyed! 5/5+Arugula salad: I first tried this salad years ago and now I always have to order it. The combination of the bite from the arugula, bright acidity of lemon, and savory saltiness from the cheese makes for such a great combination. As of this review, indoor dining requires vaccination proof (vaccine card and ID to match the names). Otherwise you can request outdoor dining but know that outdoor seating is limited!"
873,"Given all the great pizza New York City has, this place isn't too bad but I wouldn't consider it the best. We tried a couple of the pizzas including the Tie-dye and the Rubirosa supreme. Both were moderately priced for a small size (~$24-27 per pie for six slices at a small)Personal favorites were the Rubirosa supreme over the tie-dye. The Supreme comes with a smathering of pepperonis and different sausages over a thin layer of mozarella and tomato sauce. Really love how crispy thin the pizza is, but personally wished there was more mozarella cheese on it; felt the pie was a bit too tomato-ey, if that makes any sense. The Tie dye was okay, wasn't my personal favorite but people in my party did enjoy it. The pesto on top was a nice touch, but it's not something I feel like I would rave about.Great rustic atmosphere and interior within the restaurant. Could be pretty hard to get a table as we got there right on the mark on Saturday at 12pm before it quickly got packed and people started waiting outside."
874,"I tell everyone to come here, like everyone. Never disappoints. They have 3 bottles of house red that are good and economical. Pasta - Hands down the red sauce and the damn carbonara. Sure they have other things like truffle and so on but those two are so heavenly! Half orders are permitted as well as they have two sizes. Pizza - the large might scare you but be forewarned, you'll wish you could eat more! The thin crust ricotta with garlic is so creamy.... Melt in your mouth good. The traditional grandma nonna's recipe is classic standard, the vodka pizza is good, and even the margherita!Bottom line you will not be disappointed if you're a huge pizza and pasta lover!"
875,"I'm obsessed with Rubirosa Pizza!My friend who lives locally recommended this place to be us and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience! We came on a busy Saturday afternoon and we were lucky to snag a table for 4 upon walking in.We tried their Italian Wedding Soup, Octopus, Vodka Pizza, and Bianca Pizza. The soup was rich and so very comforting on a cool autumn day. The octopus was reminiscent of grilled octopus like they make it in Italy, and it was perfectly cooked! The pizza, however, was the best part! I loved both pies but the Vodka Pizza was my favorite. The sauce was amazing and cheesy. The Bianca Pizza was great as well! It was very creamy, luscious, and everything you want in a white pizza. Service was great although the restaurant was busy! Would absolutely return!"
876,"Came here on a Sunday morning, 15 minutes before they opened without a reservation. I was able to get a table outside and was attended to right away. I had to try the tie dye pizza and I was impressed! The pizza was so thin, but so full of flavor. Between my friend and I, we were able to finish the large pizza. Overall, I highly recommend this place! The pizza was reasonably priced at $32 and is definitely worth coming here."
877,This place is soooo good! So good that I had to eat it twice in one trip! I have celiac so I am a bit limited with my pizza options but I'm not sure how much better it can get! First trip we tried the tie dye pizza with GF crust to go. It was sooooo amazing. Crust was thin and crispy and the flavor of the topping was perfectly balanced and so delicious!!! Anyway it was so good I had to go back in person to the restaurant just days later bc I was craving more. Second time got another GF pizza - half tie dye half ?pepperoni and also gluten free rigatini. The tie dye was still the best and the pasta was just ok. Just stick to the pizza. Can't wait to go back for more!!
878,"I think I've just gotta chalk this up to me missing something here, which certainly happens here and there. I've frequented most of the big names in NYC pizza at least across Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, and that being the case I was pumped to finally give Rubirosa a go and their tie dye pizza in particular. It was good, but it didn't blow me away. Star 1: How was the Service and Atmosphere?We ordered this pie for delivery so I can't comment on either the service or the atmosphere which I'm sure are wonderful, but I can say that the logistics around the delivery were great in that even by the time it arrived it was still piping hot which is a feat in and of itself these days. Star. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?Our $30.00 Large Tie Dye pizza easily fed maybe three people, which was a perfectly good deal and explained why we ended up getting two of them. Star. Stars 3 & 4: How was the food?So it's here that I just failed to connect the dots. I like thin crust no doubt about it, but this was so cracker thin that it easily crumbled, which was perfectly fine, but it was also almost entirely devoid of flavor, which was less fine. From there the topping combination was fine and produced some good flavors, but all in all I didn't think it competed with some of the incumbent players in the area. Single Star. Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?Wouldn't be my first choice. No Star."
879,"I was in NYC for work staffs and decided to try this place after a recommendation from a friend, it was such a great experience! A great place to get some good Italian food!!Excellent thin crust pizza. Appetizer portions are generous. The meatballs were very tasty and the arugula salad was delicious. The ambiance is beautiful. Depending on what time you show up, it might be super busy so I  recommend reserving a seat!"
880,"Best pizza EVER! When I lived in the city, this was my go to. I recommend it to everyone. Can't wait to go there again when I come back to NYC. 10 stars out of 5."
881,"Lombardi's Pizza is top notch!!!!While on vacation in New York, we really just stumbled upon Lombardi's Pizza. We figured we should try the pizza in New York. Being Californians, we had heard and been told that trying out the pizza in NY is the thing to do! We immediately saw how crowded and popular Lombardi's Pizza was and took that as a good sign. If it is really busy, then it must be good right? Pretty strong deductive reasoning I think lol Anyway, we ordered two pizzas for us to share. One pizza had meat on it and the other one we ordered was the White Pizza. And wowwwww! That White Pizza was SO GOOD. Literally the best white pizza I've ever had. I still think about the amazing flavors and how tasty it was. The mix of mozzarella and ricotta cheese with Alfredo sauce. Oh man, delicious! Complete bliss. I'm not ashamed to admit that we went back several times for more of that white pizza lol I wish there was a flying Grubhub or Uber Eats service that would allow me to order some white pizzas from Lombardi's and fly them to California lol Then we could re-heat them and experience the awesomeness again. Sadly we can't lol so next time we go visit, this is a must on our itinerary."
882,"I 've been coming to Lombard's for years and this was my first time back since the pandemic started.  I brought my girlfriend and her family because they never had Lombardi's before.  I was quite surprise at the changes since I've been there.  Starting with the new menu, there are specialty pies now. I remember I used to be able to have fresh garlic, parmesan and olive oil added to my pie.  I didn't see that as options on the menu any longer.  Next, was the size of the pies.  They were smaller than it used to be.  I wish there was an option to select a larger pie.We ordered 2 pies, the Margherita and the Sausage.  Taste-wise, it was ok.  There was nothing special about the sauce.  The crust was thin and crispy but it lack that smoky taste.  I was disappointed that the pies did not meet the expectations that I had described to my girlfriend.Honestly, the pies weren't any different from what we get elsewhere.  Other than that, the service was fine.Look at how big the slices were from this video taken 6 years ago.  youtu.be/BpZuItuB3AkNext time we are in the mood for pizza, we're going to Grimaldi's or John's."
883,"We were excited to try this place. Came with my students and they were great in seating a big group so quickly although they had to break us up into 2 smaller groups. The service was great. As for the food, a student in the other group said that the clam pizza was ""an experience"". One person got the basil pasta and she really liked it. In my small group, we shared the pesto pizza, Margherita pizza, and the Cake Boss pizza. Of the 3, they liked the pesto one the best. We were all disappointed with the Margherita one. The Cake Boss pizza was basically the Margherita with prosciutto and arugula. On all three pizzas, the crusts were really hard, with the one on the Margherita one being the hardest."
884,"I was getting an itch.  A travel itch again and went back to New York City in November 2021 for a quick 3 day weekend trip.  I went with a friend, and it was his first time in New York City, so I wanted to show him the NYC basics.  So one of the meals we had was at Lombardi's Pizza.  Lombardi's is known as  ""America's First Pizzeria"" since 1905.  I had gone to Lombardi's previously when I used to live in NYC and remember the lines being really long.  To my surprise, the line was short (mostly because my friend and I were comfortable seating indoors).  A quick show of our COVID vaccination cards, and we were seated within 10 minutes.  We tried their Pizza (Original Margarita), Pasta (Rigatoni & Meatballs), & Wings (Buffalo).  We each had a couple of cocktails.  ENJOY!"
885,"I can now say I've visited the first pizzeria in the United States! Had a pleasant experience at Lombardi's, but the servings can be on the smaller side in my opinion. Especially when looking at the prices and expecting something a bit larger. Pizza is very light with lots of strong attributes to it. I also wish the pizzas had more sizes rather than being all 12"". Also fair warning this place is cash only, which can be inconvenient.We got the classic margherita pizza and and the ravioli. The pizza was a classic, super simple with tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. There was a nice crunch due to the crispy crust and it held together smoothly. However, like I mentioned, the pizza was fairly light so not too filling or heavy. This was also because the classic pizza used the minimal ingredients, offering small areas of tomato sauce on crust when not covered by mozzarella. I'm not sure if the other pizzas may be a little heavier, but I doubt it. Seems like simplicity is king here.Ravioli wasn't too surprising. Six pieces like it's written, neatly wrapped and light. Ricotta on the inside was delicious but in all honestly it felt like typical ravioli I can get anywhere. I did enjoy the presentation though."
886,"Lombardi's is known as the first pizzeria in the United States. That alone should make it a place worth visiting. The problem is the pizza isn't that good; it's a thicker crust than most New York shops which is ambitious because the crust isn't even that good. Apart from the cool history, other redeeming qualities of this restaurant are the meatballs (super good), the Stromboli (also really good, the sauce has pepperonis in it), and the service (which is phenomenal). They are cash only."
887,"This may be an NYC institution but it falls short to today's standards. There's so much amazing pizza in this city and Lombardi's pies do not impress. Everything about the pie was mediocre, from the dry crust to the tomato sauce. And at $26 for a rather small pie, I would much rather grab a slice elsewhere.Also the server overcharged us by $2. Could definitely have been a mistake."
888,"I love Lombardi's for their flavor forward sauce, you can tell the care they put into crafting such a great homemade sauce. Definitely pay Lombardi's a visit - it's a part of history as well and the whole experience speaks to that. The restaurant ambiance is reminiscent of early New York and they've done a great job to preserve that.Of course do try the margarita pizza as it allows the freshness of their tomato sauce to shine. In addition to that they have an arugula and prosciutto pie which is delicious. I LOVE a good clam pie and this is a pretty decent option for that as well. I'd prefer it to be a little less dry to be honest but it's still very flavorful and delicious."
889,"Great pizza spot. We tried another sit-down pizza spot in the area and were given over an hour wait time for a table of four so we tried this place and got seated in about 15 mins. All together we ordered these pizzas: Original Margherita, Basil Pesto Pie, and Famous Clam Pie. My favorite was definitely the pesto. The clam was great and very unique but I was satiated after just one slice of it. The margherita was very solid. We also got the Caesar Salad which was a great palate cleanser from all the pizza we were devouring. Definitely worth the visit!"
890,"Boasting to be NYCs first pizzeria, Lombardi's in Little Italy is bustling on the corner of Spring and Mott. I love clam pies and I was excited to try Lombardi's. We ordered the pizza to go and ate it about 15 minutes later. When we opened the box there was a waft of fish smell which we were not expecting. We decided to try it regardless of the smell. The overuse of garlic and oil/butter. They get props for their thin crust, that's where it ends. The price point was $30 for a small clam, which is pretty steep. Don't get sucked in by this tourist trap."
891,"New York City and Pizza!! Why not! I was craving late night Pizza, so I used Yelp to see what was good. I picked Lombardi's because of the Yelp reviews. I ordered on Grubhub/Postmate from here late night - surprised they were open still! Yelp reviews is what led me to this decision, I was not disappointed. Just wish I could have heated it up! We ordered a couple of pies and some side dishes!! Let's see what's good here!Margherita Pizza extra sauce - didn't need the extra sauce - too much. Get as is. FirePepperoni Pizza - FireWhite Pie with spinach and mushroom - really good. I love Ricotta Cheese on Pizza Cake Boss Special - Fire! Really good. Might do with a different meat next time. But overall great Chicken Parm- surprisingly very good! Overall - a very good place. I love the sauce on the pizza's. Wish I was able to heat up, I know if I was or ate in person this place would be even better!"
892,"Please remember, this is just my personal opinion based on my taste preference and dining experience. Having said that, I can in no way recommend this pizza place if you are looking for an authentic Italian, wood fired pizza. We ordered tap waters and a glass jug w/2 plastic cups were brought to the table. The water is yellow. Why is their tap water yellow? I have been drinking NYC tap water for 2 days and it has never been yellow. After walking several miles we needed water, but this water was not appealing.We specifically searched for 'wood fired pizza' but we don't see any wood fire pizza ovens and the kitchen appears to be in the basement so we can't verify how the pizza is cooked. The outer edge of the crust is thick and as the pizza is cooked 'well done' this section is hard and chewy, although still edible. The center of the crust was soggy. The liberally applied sauce is a heavy tomato puree with very little seasoning. Ask for oregano or parmesan if you need a bit more flavor and they will bring shaker containers for the table. You may also want salt, which is not on the table.The mozzarella has a good 'string factor'- that is, when you bite into the cheese and pull away, you get that cheese string connecting your mouth to your pizza slice. The sliced basil has a slight anise flavor to it. A true wood fired pizza cooks quickly in a searing hot oven giving it a crisp bottom and blackening the edges of crust closest to the flames while the interior of the crust remains soft. This crust has neither of these qualities. The sauce should be a very light, flavorful tomato puree. These two are the basis of a good wood fired Italian pizza. That is not what we received during our visit."
893,Good flat bead and mushroom soup ! But this is not a pizza place if is on pita bread and two for one drinks are 18 !You can get wine for 12 ! You Do you have to get the same drink for two for one ! Great location fresh tomatoes it doesn't get it to packed
894,"I had a bad experience recently with a local joint that supposedly had authentic style NY pizza. So, I said to myself, why not get the real deal in NY?Hailed as the first pizzeria in the nation, Lombardi's sits on a corner street in Manhattan's Little Italy. Got in on a Thursday afternoon and it wasn't too crowded at all. Waited outside for maybe about 15 minutes for a seat. Was a pleasant wait as I took in all the sights and sounds of the NY neighborhood. Inside, it's clean, comfortable and well-staffed. Had a really good vibe and a familial atmosphere. I ordered a pepperoni pizza and my friend had the clam pie. Pizzas are on the pricier side, but they're large enough to share for two (unless you're really hungry like I was). They have other traditional Italian dishes on the menu, but it's the pizza I was looking for.Came out in a pretty quick amount of time. The pepperoni is a delicious pizza. Very well-balanced taste, not too salty, but flavorful. The thin crust really made the difference. If you've eaten lots of chain restaurant pizzas like I have, you'll definitely know the difference in quality. The clam pie was buttery and flavorful as well. Every bite you got a mouthful of clams. Never thought clam pizzas existed before, and it's too bad I only learned now!Definitely will be coming back if I'm in town again!"
895,"Consistently ranking among NYC's best pizza options, you have to give Lombardi's a try if you're in the neighborood. If not, you won't be particularly challenged to find a decent slice, but you'll still be missing out, on the experience if nothing else.Truth be told, the pizza is just OK. And a bit costly, too. But judge for yourself.    It's a part of NYC history. Then again, so are the Stonewall Riots & the fires that plagued the Bronx in the 1970s."
896,"The food here is 5 stars but the prices for the portion is 4 stars. The pies here are small especially for NY pizza and the crust is thin and crispy, which I loved. Clam pizza - topped with tons of clams! Doesn't have cheese or a sauce which I thought would be weird but it was actually better to let the clams shine. The garlic and herbs perfectly balanced the clams and the crust stayed crispy which is the reason I liked it better than Frank Pepe's!Double pepperoni pizza - topped with deliciously thick and curly pepperoni. The bottom was a little soggy towards the center but the outer part stayed crispy. Calzone - the real star of the menu! We got it filled with sausage and meatballs and it was stuffed. The marinara sauce was excellently flavorful that we had to ask for another portion of it to dip our crusts."
897,We came here for dinner and had the original margarita pizza. The reason I wanted to try this is because you can't hide. Either the pizza is good or it isn't. And this... isn't .... The cheese was good. It was stretchy. The sauce had absolutely no flavor and fresh. The crust was thin and crunchy. It was extremely crunch and difficult to eat. I would not recommend. IF... IF IF IF I every go back I will try the pepperoni pizza. I think this place is overpriced and the pizza we had was not good at all and I would never order it again.
898,"I love pizza; my wife will tell you that I could eat pizza 3 meals a day, 7 days a week. When I found out that  Lombardi's was America's first pizzeria I just had to try them out while in NYC to see the Rockettes Christmas Show... Wow!! Well we ordered an American classic pizza... The Double Pepperoni. OMG, it was amazing!! I absolutely loved the crust, crispy and slightly chewy with a hint of char from the oven. The sauce is thick, tomatoey and hearty with a nice kick to it. It's definitely one of the best pizzas I've had in a long time. There are a couple of cons though. First it's hard to believe that this pizza cost $28. The other con is it's cash only; so bring enough to cover drinks as well.Can't wait to come back and try another pizza!!"
899,"Great service!  We went by on a Tuesday evening no wait.  Service was great, fast and efficient.   Pizza was good definitely on the thin side but delicious.   We'll be back."
900,"OVERHYPED. Decent pizza, I wouldn't say it's the best on the planet. America's first pizzeria est 1905. GOOD WATER"
901,"Again I've said for many years this is the best pizza I've ever had and I've eaten all over outside of Italy.  I would even go as far as it say. I like it better than what I ate in Italy. It is the best. Also no, it's the first pizza slices sold in the United States so it's great"
902,"I was  visiting New York for my husband birthday and had this place on my places to visit list. This pizzeria is located in little Italy. Lombardi's is known to be American first pizzeria. I loved the ambiance of the restaurant, it gave me old Italian vibes. The pizza was good but nothing spectacular. The staff was very friendly and attentive to our needs. The prices were kind of expensive but we are in New York right. A small pie was $24 and to add toppings were an extra $4. Overall I enjoyed my experience at this pizzeria.FYI they accept cash only."
903,"Always a favorite. You can't beat the clam pie, except maybe at Frank Pepe's. But it's damn good here. The crust is perfect and the seasoning on point. We always add extra clams and never go wrong. Tried the meatballs this time, too, and they were very good. Nice texture and flavor. I'm not Italian, so I don't know what authentic Italian really means - I just know they were good. Service is good, too. There's always a wait, but it wasn't too bad: about 30 minutes. If you're planning a trip, keep in mind, it's cash only."
904,"Ordered a pizza for pick up before my friends flight because she wanted to try some New York pizza. Figured we'd go to the original spot! We ordered online about 15 minutes before we had to head out thinking it would be ready within that 15 minutes like it said but it only got accepted 20 minutes later and then took another 20 minutes to be ready. I can understand they were busy but maybe change the advertisement so that people know it takes longer to prepare. Anyway the pizza is only sold by the pie and it's more of a personal than meant to be shared. The sauce was fantastic, a little tangy and think, and the dough was nice and chewy while a bit crunchy and crispy on the outside. Really delicious. It's a cool piece of Italian American history and definitely need to try it at least once in life, but it's so busy that it's okay to skip it and get a slice to go from one of the other great spots in nyc."
905,"Very overhyped pizza joint that I really wanted to like, but fell flat. The sauce was flavorless and like pureed tomatoes. That sauce drenched the crust and half of the toppings slid off the slices. Fairly expensive and very bland equals a miss. After finishing our pie here we headed over to Prince Street for a decent slice."
906,"There's so many highly reviewed pizza joints in New York that it was hard to choose where to go (especially if your a tourist), but decided to come to Lombardi's as it's the first Pizzeria in New York.We got the basic Sausage, Peppers, and Onions pizza and it hurts to say that it was just OK considering that it was on the pricier side. The crust was thin and had a nice chew to it, and they were very generous with the toppings. Other than that, the food wasn't that memorable and didn't convince me that NY pizza is superior.Besides the food, the service here was great! We were kind of lost/ unsure where the restaurant was and stood there confused for a few minutes before one of the workers asked if we needed help and got us seated right away! The servers there were very attentive and made sure we had everything.Overall, if you want to experience a piece of history of New York, definitely come and check this place out! But if you're on a mission to find the best pizza in NY, I suggest trying other pizzerias NY has to offer."
907,"The first pizzeria in the US, I had to try! They are considered a landmark. Oven brick pizza and known for their ""Clam Pizza"". It's more of an experience here. The food is great and in abundance. I really enjoyed the clam pizza and their pepperoni pie. Just make sure you bring cash! They don't take cards. Also, the line is long."
908,"This review is strictly for their Clam Pizza.My foodie pals and I have been on a mission to find the best Clam Pizza. We've been to a few lackluster places and we were disappointed in our search.  I recalled that a few years ago,  I had a fantastic Clam Pizza at Lombardi's in Chelsea. Sadly, that location is temporarily closed due to covid. However, their original location on Spring St is still open. Sooo, we trekked to Spring St to continue our quest for the best clam pizza!Apparently, you cannot order a large 16"" clam pie ($35) for dine-in but you can order it for takeout. You can only order the small 12"" clam pie ($32) for dine-in. I really don't understand why we can't order the large pie for dine-in and I don't understand the $3 price difference. Somehow, I feel like I'm getting ripped off for ordering the small pie for $32.  (Note that a large clam pie in their Chelsea location was also $35). I just feel that the smaller pie should be less than $32.Ok, so overlooking the strange pricing, I have to say, Lombardi's clam pizza remains my #1 spot for best clam pie!  Yup, it's gonna be hard to beat this clam pie.  This pizza has a great thin & crispy crust, good amounts of garlic (although I wouldn't say no to more garlic), and LOADS of clams!! It's served with a half lemon and you'll want to squeeze this lemon on the pie!  Lombardi's claims to use fresh clams, however, someone in my group thought the clams were bought shucked & frozen. I couldn't tell if they were fresh or frozen.  All I know is, thus far, this is my fave clam pizza!We've already tried Pepe's in CT, Vincent's in Carle Place, and Milkflower in Astoria. Next on my radar: Denino's in Greenwich Village - voted best clam pizza in NYC! Can it beat Lombardi's?!?!  We shall see.  My quest continues..."
909,"A New York staple everyone needs to visit! A romantic intimate pizzeria nestled in the heart of Spring street. We loved the Caesar Salad, Classic Margarita Pizza, & Rustic Double Pepperoni Pizza. You can taste the fresh ingredients. Definitely go get some!"
910,One of the best pizza spots in NY. This and L&B spumoni gardens in Brooklyn takes my heart. You'll love this pizza trust me.
911,"I ordered from their To Go menu (by the slice instead of the pizza). When I went, there was no wait to order. This was approximately 7 pm on a Sunday.I ordered a slice of the Grandma pizza ($4) and the pepperoni pizza ($5). Once you order it, they reheat the pizza. Both slices were delicious. The highlight of the pizza was definitely the fresh tomatoes on top. I would definitely recommend trying by the slice if you don't want a whole pie. You also have more options."
912,"We went here for some NY pizza back in Aug 2019. I miss this place so much and wished CA had a place like this here! Service was ok , they sat us in the back so the waiter was hard to get a hold of if we needed something. The table was hobbling too but you come here for the pizza I guess lolWe got the half Classic Margherita and White Ricotta ! The bread of the pizza I don't usually finish eating but oh my gosh! At Lombardi's, you'll want to finish every single bite! Can't wait to come back here again if I'm ever around"
913,"Good service. Pizza was fine, solid but nothing special. The wait for a table was 45 mins at 5:30pm. There is only one bathroom for the entire large restaurant, about ten people in line at a time. So like a 20 minute wait for the bathroom. They do not check covid vaccination status per NY law."
914,This was such a crushing disappointment to bring my kids here after so many good memories in the past.  The pizza didn't come out with the other food; the rest of the food was cold by the time our pizza finally arrived.  Apparently the first pizza was burned and they had to make us a new one; didn't offer any accommodation at all.  Salad was wilted and uninspired.  I will never ever come back here.  Bummer because I have such fond memories of this place.
915,We ordered the meatball and pepperoni. Best pizza we've had in New York. The crust is cooked perfectly and the meatball was amazing. The sauce was very good and the portions were perfect. Definitely would recommend to anyone we know going out this way.
916,Work hard to get us in quick.  No reservations!! Staple NY Pizza place. Great food great service
917,The first pizzeria in AmericaFriendly atmosphere Great pizza If you are visiting little Italy
918,"The first pizza maker in America.  They still have the original coal fired oven from back in 1905.  Ingredients are all top notch, especially the fresh mozzarella.  You may need to wait a little to get in but well worth it."
919,"One of the best pizzas I've ever had in my life!This restaurant is huge with a lot of seats. We weren't very hungry when we arrived since we've done our own food tour all day. But man when the pizza arrived, it was so good that we finished the entire thing! So much for being not so hungry. We tried the margherita pizza and it was just perfect. Now I understand why people always rave about NY pizza"
920,"Half white & half meatball pizza was the star The other items were good but not superb.  Caesar salad, ravioli's were good. The chicken Parmesan was not too great."
921,"When it comes to pizza, you can't get anymore original than Lombardi's they kinda invented it. Ordered the pepperoni pizza with the Bruschetta for the appetizer. Service was excellent and very friendly. Must try the Italian sangria!"
922,"Good pizza, but is it worth $25? You decide.Yes, Nolita (North of Little Italy for you non-New Yorkers), combined with New York City prices, it is going to be expensive. I liked the pizza and I liked the service, but for 6 slices and a regular party you are going to need multiple pies. And as a result you are going to easily spend $100 here. The thin crust works here. It has a nice crunch to chew feel, just the right amount of salt and flavor. The cheese and sauce marry up well too. It creates a nice symphony of flavors to keep you wanting another slice. Normally I would say I feel guilty for eating 6 slices but quite frankly I do not feel as bad as I should be feeling.Would I come back here for pizza? Probably not. Not alone at least. But considering I have never tried Lombardi's Pizza I am happy I did. Next time I will have to try their calzone. Oh, bring cash! They do not accept credit cards for in-house dining."
923,The sauce.  The cheese.  Oh my!   Worth the $25 Lyft ride both ways.    My young one at 3 slices of the classic margarita pizza.   She only eats 1 piece back at home from our favorite pizza place.   We also had a calaZone that was also good but I would go pizza more than calaOzone.  Order 2 since the pies are not that big and you definitely don't want to go home dreaming of wanting more of this deliciousness.     Reasonably priced and our waiter was awesome.   Definitely will be coming back and would for sure recommend.
924,"So good. We ordered the two meatballs in sauce which was yummy. Three pizzas (pepperoni, margarita, and the garlic meatball). All were great but the pepperoni was so good. We also enjoyed the salad to share and their spritzer cocktails. Highly recommend."
925,"This spot was recommended to me by one of my professors so we decided to check it out and it did not disappoint! My friends and I ordered a margarita pizza for delivery and even after it was delivered, it still tasted warm and fresh; I was even able to get a perfect cheese pull. The crust is thin and the sauce is flavorful. You cant go wrong with this classic ny pizza spot."
926,"Easy location to find. Rude staff. Only take cash, no debit or credit cards but there is an ATM on site. Food was good but overall not worth the hype due to staff."
927,Do yourself a favor and skip Lombardi's. This place is a tourist trap. Overpriced and the pizza is mediocre.
928,My mon recommended this place as it is America's first pizzeria!! It was delicious we loved all the pies we got. Highly recommend and entirely with the wait.
929,"We ate dinner at Lombardi's after our first option fell through. However, we really enjoyed the double pepperoni pizza. They had a bit of a wait and we didn't love having to sit outside in the cold, but the food came quickly, the pizza tasted fresh, and the service was solid."
930,This was a great dessert pit stop! Everything was so delicious! It can get a little crowded and crazy but worth it!
931,"Wow ... definitely desserts that will put you in a sugar coma, but they are absolutely amazing if you like sweets. Grace Street was packed when I went, which was on a Wednesday night in the middle of a hurricane so I can only imagine how busy it is normally!It's a counter style restaurant, so they will take your order at the front and give you a buzzer when it's ready. The food here is definitely aesthetically pleasing and very good - it's just definitely incredibly sweet so I couldn't eat all of it. Regardless, the atmosphere here is super chatty and warm, and the desserts are a must have if you love shaved ice!"
932,"Pre-covid I'm pretty sure that you got to give your order at the counter in the back, but now they require proof of vaccine and you pay before you enter. I got the OG Shaved ice and it was HUGE. I split it with my mom and we could not finish it. I think you can comfortably split between three or four people. My mom loved the rich sesame taste in the shaved ice and the red beans and strawberries that came with it. I also ordered the special ube drink for her to try but I thought that it tasted a bit too sweet. I had the rose petal milk tea before and liked it, and was happy to have it again. Would recommend the rose petal milk tea-- the only thing that looked beautiful and tasted amazing. I also miss the old look of grace street. It used to look a bit better, but now it kind of looks like a mess. The walls were covered in cheap plastic plants and you can see where customers have ripped it to uncover the outlets so that they can work inside. Customer service was quite nice though. They took my order very quickly and I didn't have to wait too long for my order to be ready. They also appeared out of nowhere to help me dispose of my plates. Also, even though this place is quite popular and busy, I manage to find a table each time. Note that the times I go here is usually for a lunch dessert, not a dinner dessert."
933,"Super cute cafe with a lot of seating space to accommodate big groups! It's a great hangout spot and could be a fun date spot if the noise does not bother you. You place your order at the entrance, then pick up a buzzer and get seated inside. You pick up your order at the back of the cafe when it is ready.I didn't try the shaved ice but I did try the ho-dduk and was a big fan! The ho-dduk ($7.25) comes with one donut that is cut into quarters and a big scoop of vanilla ice cream. The donut is deep fried on all sides and the dough is very chewy. I guess most people would probably go for the aesthetic milk teas or lattes (like the rose, lavender, matcha, etc.) but I ended up just getting an americano ($3.67). It was pretty solid and definitely better than Starbucks. The espresso here has a more bitter profile as opposed to an acidic/sour profile. It helped balance out the sweetness from the ho-dduk!"
934,"Grace Street is my go-to cafe in midtown, as I haven't really found a worthy competitor for drinks and dessert in the area. It's perfect for small or large groups, as they have the space to accommodate. Great for conversation, but wouldn't say it's the cafe for quiet studying, especially during busy hours and weekends as it can get really loud. I love coming here for their shaved ice, particularly the O.G. (black sesame flavored ice with strawberries, condensed milk, and mochi), and more recently, for their matcha beignets, which is served with a mountain of powered sugar. Perfect for people with a sweet tooth! Their drinks are also pretty good -- my favorite is the rose milk tea. I'm a creature of habit and get these often enough to say they're always consistent in their quality."
935,"It's pricey but I think it's better to share 1 food item between 2 people and get separate drinks. Better for your wallet, health (also your wallet), and friendship :)The overload of flavor can get tiring to eat for one person. Vietnamese coffee is not exactly right, but it's still a good drink. I think it has just regular sugar instead of the sweetened condensed milk. Boba toast it's worth getting. The layery toast, ice cream, kettle corn, and the caramely sauce is a great combo.Matcha cheesecake is overly dense. Reminds me of cheese foam, bouncy cheesecake, and American cheesecake. Maybe I should've only eaten half of it. :')Order and pay when you enter and there's a bathroom in the back. Large cute place and vibes."
936,"Amazing mochis! So soft and pillowy, amazing treat at the end of the day! Also got a chance to try the matcha beignets, absolutely amazing! Melts in your mouth as soon as you bite in. Definitely recommend!"
937,"[Same as my previous 5/13/2021 review; just added more quality pictures]-Best Korean shaved ice in the city.While their cafe was packed (justifiably on a Friday evening), the service was reasonably quick. I do not think they took more than 10 minutes on such a busy evening where just about every table had been filled up. 10/10 service.The cafe sits right at the heart of Koreatown and the atmosphere inside is well-lit and comforting. Not only does Grace Street serve the best Korean shaved ice (bingsu), but  this cafe also shares some great-tasting pastries and other desserts like beignets, waffles, bubble tea, and ice cream.You are also allowed to be creatively delicious by customizing your own bingsu dessert - we mixed together matcha bingsu, honey boba, condensed milk drizzle, and mochi.  10/10 - recommend, and need to try again."
938,"My friend had been raving about this place so I was so excited to try it out when she took me there. We got there around 7:30 pm on a Tuesday night, and there was a bit of a line, but it actually moved pretty quickly and the line died down within 5-10 min. The three of us there had a difficult time deciding what to get since the entire menu looked so good, but we eventually decided on two items.Food:- Basque Cheesecake--$9.99 (4 Inch)I loved how creamy and smooth this cheesecake was! The center was runny and extra creamy which was both fun and delicious to eat. What was nice was that although it was a very velvety dessert, it was not overly rich and was just the right amount of sweetness.- The O.G. Shaved Ice--$14.24This shaved ice was black sesame flavored with mochi, red beans, fresh strawberries, condensed milk, and misugaru. It was one of my friend's first time eating Korean shaved ice, and she was so impressed to find that it was smooth like ice cream. I was very happy that the texture was fluffy and smooth, just how I liked it. The nuttiness and subtle sweetness of the black sesame flavored went wonderfully with the sweet red beans and the smooth shaved ice texture paired perfectly with the chewy little bits of mochi.Tips:- Order and pay for your desserts at the counter first, and then find seating. There is an abundant amount of seating inside.- Two desserts were the perfect amount for the three of us to enjoy after eating dinner."
939,"I was just walking around Koreatown to get dessert and this place just looked mad poppin' from the outside. There was a line forming on the small crowded sidewalk so I took a chance on them and ordered the small basque cheesecake for two. It was $14.14. Not sure what to make of the price but I'm on vacation so I didn't really care. There was a worker who seated us at a shared table and we got a buzzer which rang as soon as we sat. They're quick with their business. The cheesecake was exquisite and the vibe was too. It felt like a bar, but it was just a cafe. It was bustling, lots of people, and there were even some people studying there despite all the noise. The only thing that could be improved is having the workers stand out from the crowd (uniform or even a name badge) because I wasn't sure who's attention to get if I needed assistance since everyone was so busy in the front and at the bar."
940,Sushi and Ramen were great. Tuna and yellow tail on the combo were awesome...I definitely recommend it.
941,Jimmy is great! Excellent service! Thanks Jimmy! I really enjoyed the green tea ice cream!
942,"I had the omakase. Great sashimi, I'd skip the spicy tune but I've never found a place I like it at so take that with a grain of salt. Fast service and helpful staff."
943,"This place is fantastic!!!! We went here during happy hour and we ordered everything from karage, cucumber salad to fried chicken. And of course the Ramen!!!Ask for Jimmy. Super friendly!!!!"
944,"Good, but they overcharge you compared to other ramen/sushi restaurants so you're more than paying for itThe service was ok"
945,"To be fair, I don't like ramen much or noodles. For me, this was way too salty and I left hungry, wanting more vegetables and less noodles. I do appreciate them offering vegan ramen. The organic sake is good.Service is not personalized; it's a true ramen bar experience. Prepare to wait to be seated and wait before you can give an order. Happy hour prices until 8pm."
946,"my family and i had the beef ramen, lady gaga roll, chicken teriyaki bento box, and the dynamite roll. we thought everything was pretty average. i enjoyed the ramen the most.in terms of service, it was just okay"
947,What a great find right by Times Square. A little place packed with people looking for a great quality Japanese food for a reasonable price. The mango dragon sushi was delicious. The spicy tonkatsu shoyu was so good even with the pork belly meat that I normally don't like. It was yummy!!Tip: plan on paying cash or they'll charge you 3.99% more to charge it.
948,"This is clearly a local favorite as it was super packed when we arrived around 6:15 pm. We had theatre tickets and so didn't want to be late; the table turnover was pretty good and we were seated in about 15 minutes. However it took what seemed forever for the server to come by to take our order--nail biter!Anyway, my spouse and I each got the same miso ramen and a rock shrimp appetizer.  The rock shrimp was tasty! And my spouse said he actually liked it better than the rock shrimp from his favorite Japanese place in NYC. The ramen was good but not spectacular. The pork belly was too fatty but the broth was flavorful."
949,"Got my table and vaccine card check swiftly. Food came quickly without too much wait. I love the interior bar/ island seating. It's very customer-facing, easy to place your order and get your food. I love the thick slice of pork belly. Tender in a way where you know it's been cooked for a while. Generous portion of noodles. Only thing I wished they had was the happy hour menu. Maybe they just don't have it on weekends?  I went on a Saturday."
950,"Happy hour specials are amazing here! My only regret is that I should've tipped more.Me and a friend shared 3 rolls (shrimp tempura, tempura purple yam, and eel) and karaage. Everything was super satisfying. The pricing ($5 each item) really can't be beat in this area, especially if you are in the mood to sample a lot of different rolls and apps.The happy hour drinks are a nice deal. I'm not a huge drinker but I decided to try the Tokyo ice tea - it tasted OK and was pretty strong (imo). I'd probably just order more apps next time."
951,"Hovering around 2-3, I was very shocked by the ratings given the quantity of reviews. I think I might've ordered a bad item though, so there's potential. I figure it's generally not worth ordering the sushi here when it's not happy hour or lunch (for lunch specials) as they are extremely overpriced. You also get 6 pieces rather than 8 for the high cost. There are signs saying they have increased prices due to rising costs but you save with cash.I think the ramen generally looked pretty good. The broth definitely looked like there was flavor and a hot bowl of ramen is always good. My friend opted for the spicy beef and had good things to say.However, I foolishly opted to be unique and get the Hawaiian Breeze. They're cold noodles and you get a bowl of ""house special sauce"" which was basically soy sauce with olive oil. I disliked the sauce and mixing it with the bowl was a mistake as it made everything overly salty (I only mixed a small bit too, not even the entire thing). I later checked reviews and only found like 5 reviews mentioning this item, all from 2-3 years ago. Maybe they changed the recipe or something but I personally did not enjoy it. Highly recommend hot ramen choices instead."
952,Once again I went to Yelp for help to locate a Ramen place & u didn't let me down.  I knew when we walked up it would be good because the line was about 40 foot long. Once we made it to a table I went with the Tonkotsu Ramen. It was fantastic I just wish there was more ramen but hey I was satisfied when it was all gone AAA+++
953,"Was a last minute place my friends and I found when we were craving some soup/broth in the area and it was great! Has high top seating and also tables, but it does get a little cramped so it might be a little hard to walk around.  It does get a little harder to also get the waiter/waitress's attention when they get busy, but they really try to take care of your needs right away once you let them know! Still, the food came out fast and tasted great, especially for the price! Note, they REALLY check your vaccination card and makes sure you got two shots to be let in."
954,"Today I was in a Japanese mood so I stopped by here and tried a few dishes. I got Takoyaki, Gyoza, Japanese Curry, Tonkotsu Ramen.Takoyaki: good, the octopus was cooked well. Outside was a little crispier than I would have liked, but it wasn't bad.Gyoza: Meh, tasted like your run of the mill frozen Gyoza you buy from Hmart.Japanese Curry: Nasty, it looked like vomit and tasted like pure salt. Practically inedible.Tonkotsu Ramen: Not bad, it's not as good as Ippudo's but it is ok.Overall: Will not likely go back to, there was nothing special or even that good about it."
955,"The space was pretty packed at 2pm, but they had space in the counter. We ordered promptly and got our ramen in under 15 minutes. I got the Tonkotsu Shoyu - rich soy-based broth, with delicious thick slices of pork belly. Noodles were perfectly al dente and soaked up the broth with every bite. The added Black Garlic oil made the broth very umami. It is a little pricey, but I think it is worth it since I enjoyed the ramen very much."
956,"Tip 1: Go during their happy hour (4-8PM)! They have $5 appetizers, sushi rolls, and alcoholic beverages! Tip 2: Don't forget to check in through Yelp to get free ice cream (choice of green tea or vanilla) Food: The $5 options are on the smaller side, so if you are just getting those to eat, then you would need multiple! - Mango Mojito: surprisingly refreshing, and for $5 this was a steal!- Yellowtail Jalapeño Roll: Tasted freshly made and hit the spicy note with the jalapeño - Tuna Avocado Roll: Standard but went well to balance out the spicier roll above - Karage: hard to dislike fried chicken! Came out piping hot, but I'm not sure about its authenticity as the texture seems different than other karage I've had in the past - Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen: Not the best ramen in the city but decent. Broth was pretty good, but it wasn't that spicy for my palate, and the pork belly should be more tender. I do like that they give you different options for the noodles. I went with the thin kind, but in retrospect, I should have chosen one of the thicker ones since I like my noodles to have a bit more bite- Spicy Beef Ramen: my friend thought this was also a solid option with tasty broth - Green Tea Ice Cream (free): Similar to other ones I've had in the pastService/Ambiance: Walked in without a reservation for two people on a Friday night at 6:30PM, and we were seated immediately.There is indoor and outdoor dining available with plastic partitions separating the tables from each other. Service was quick, friendly, and efficient! Overall: If you are looking for amazing ramen, then look elsewhere, but the happy hour deals here are solid!"
957,"We were looking for a quick meal on a hectic Friday afternoon and came across Zen. It was pretty full at 3:30 in the afternoon, but we snagged one of the last tables in the restaurant without having to wait. Their vegetarian options are not terribly prolific, but hey, at least there's something. The best part of the experience was how quickly our food came out. Within 5 minutes of ordering, we were ready to dig in. The noodles themselves were great, although the broth was a bit lackluster. Aside from the obvious shoyu flavor, there wasn't much depth at all. But it was a quick and easy meal that got us back on the road soon after."
958,"Wow! The Ramen here was amazing, service was great. We definitely recommend you to try this place out. I ordered the Spicy Vegetable Ramen , perfect for this cold weather ! It had pieces of fried tofu which gave it a crunch with each bite YUM! My husband ordered beef ramen and yellowtail sashimi! Everything was so fresh ! We will be back ! Thank You Zen & Team!"
959,We came here on a Monday evening and enjoyed the food! I know this place is known for its Ramen but we did not try that so I will need to come back and try that next time. I did try the chicken Karaage and the Pork Gyoza and they were very good for a cheap price. In addition to the appetizers I grabbed a few rolls from the Happy Hour menu and they tasted like your standard sushi rolls from a restaurant. Once again we were not too hungry so did not try any of the specialty items so I will have to try that next time I am back.I would recommend this place as a nice spot for an evening meal if anyone is in the mood for a Japanese dinner.
960,"Yummy Ramen! This little whole in the wall has some very testy Ramen among other yummy traditional Japanese dishes. Space is limited and waiting for a table is comom during pick hours.  Give this place a try, perefec to warm up during a cold day of walking around the city."
961,"After a long day of walking and exploring the city, we ended close to the Macy's to check out the Christmas windows. We did a little searching for places to eat close by and saw this spot with 4.5 stars. We wanted to call and make a reservation but on the phone, we were told that it was only a 20min wait and that reservations were not necessary. After arriving not too long after the call, somehow the wait jumped to 45mins. We still decided to put our names down. After we were sat down, 3 of the 4 of us ordered ramen, and I ended up ordering sushi. We were all extremely impressed and satisfied with the quality and taste of the food at this spot. This has had to be the best sushi I have tried in so long. I ordered sushi off their happy hour menu and was completely satisfied and full. I definitely recommend coming here! After we left, there was a long wait time, so 45min wait was not anything compared to what others had to wait. It's best to come during early dinner hours to avoid the long wait."
962,"This restaurant had a short wait, and it isn't large inside but they have the outside street seating. We ate outside and it was very cold out but the perfect temperature inside. The service was great and I do not know how our server remembered our entire order but he did! We had happy hour drinks and they were delicious. I had a lychee martini with beautiful pieces of fruit. I've never had a bowl of restaurant ramen! This was my first and the spicy lemongrass broth was amazing. I had shrimp on mine. Service was exceptional. Inside they only have one tiny bathroom but the wait wasn't long."
963,"Came here a while back, but I still have the picture recipes.I remember the service being polite. The ramen was average in my opinion and the squid was tasty."
964,"I was along for the ride because the boy was still hungry and I know not to stand in his way when he he's dead set on a big bowl of ramen. This place is definitely popular, but I felt better about dining inside when I saw all the plastic partitions between the customers, even at the bar. Lucky for us it was happy hour, so we saddled up to the long skinny horseshoe of a ramen bar with our shopping bags surrounding our feet and ordered a beer. Echigo stouts for $5 on happy hour is a deal and one that should not be missed. I definitely enjoyed mine. The staff here was no nonsense. Not unfriendly, but definitely kept those orders moving.After seeing all the attractive bowls of ramen whiz by me from my seat near the kitchen, I cracked under the pressure and ordered the Spicy Vegetable Ramen (which is actually vegan when you get the traditional thin noodle). I'll be honest that I couldn't eat half of it because I actually wasn't that hungry walking in, but damn what I did have was absolutely delicious. The tofu had a slight crisp and had a spicy sauce drizzled over it and the broth was packed with flavor and veggies.I may have not been able to finish my bowl but the vegan ramen here is definitely one I would recommend (and return for)."
965,"3 stars for just an average experience. FOOD:Karaage Udon Noodles - The soup and Karaage were very salty. Karaage is served separately from the udon! Takoyaki - Average, nothing too special about it. SERVICE:We got seated right away but waited about 20-25 minutes before even getting water. The servers were a bit busy but the manager(?) was doing nothing. When we asked if he could take our order, he told us to wait for a server and proceeded to just stand there and do nothing again. It was a bit frustrating since other people who came after us were being served and acknowledged."
966,"Came across this Ramen spot because everywhere else was an hour wait!! I'm glad I tried Zen Ramen because the ramen was so filling and satisfying. I also like how they give you a big spoon too! They currently have a happy hour special every day from 4-8pm for $5 rolls and appetizers (won't last too long).I highly recommend ordering the spicy Tonkotsu Ramen if you like a little kick to it. Also took advantage of $5 sushi rolls as well. When you check into yelp, you get a free green tea or vanilla ice cream."
967,"Oh, this is embarrassing. I've been going to/ordering from Zen for years and completely forgot to leave a review.The most standout part of the menu is the meat-based ramen, especially any kind of tonkotsu. They spoil you with toppings including corn (corn!), wood ear and cabbage, and the cuts of pork are thick, fatty and delicious. Value-wise, this is the best bang for your buck for a $18-20 bowl of 'men.For sushi, their lunch special (3 rolls for $12) and Happy Hour special ($6 rolls) are hard to beat. While I'm normally a sushi purist, I have to say that their spicy rolls are a level more delicious than other restaurants', and their regular salmon is always seasoned with a bit of shio that I don't find in other places. What not to get? The veggie ramen (it's inexplicably sweet) and dumplings (limp and bland). Not their strong points.The reason this is 4 stars and not 5 is because they recently hiked up their prices by ~$2 for the same amount of food. I get that the pandemic has pushed restaurants to the brink and I'm not against paying the extra $$$ to support my favorite restaurants, but...this still sucks all the same."
968,Good $5 Happy Hour Specials.  Delicious food.  Great service  from Ven.  Free ice cream for yelp check in.
969,"Great service, Wenti was super sweet and the other workers were really kind too. Definitely coming back soon!"
970,"We can here for our last meal in NYC and it didn't disappoint! We got in within 15 minutes. The food was amazing! I got the Tonkatsu Ramen, seaweed salad, the magical roll, and a mojito. The service was fast and the food was great! Wenti is such a great server, she was so courteous! The food came out quickly, bussing was prompt, and she gave us great recommendations! Definitely come here if your in Manhattan!"
971,We came in craving sushi and decided to stop in for lunch. We were pleasantly surprised by the array & ordered the Salmon Lover and the Tiger Roll. Both were delicious!! Jimmy was very nice and accommodated us well :-)
972,Came here for dinner with family. Ate outside. Great service and great food. Not fancy. Kind of no frills but salad and dressing was great.  Also got the crazy roll which was good. One of kids got ramen and heard it was one of the best they have had. Sushi and Sashimi was fresh and rolls were good sized with perfect avocados.  All in all great experience.
973,"Come here for happy hour and you will not be disappointed - you can get rolls of sushi for $5 each and appetizers too! Good:Happy hour menu for appetizers and drinks is just 5 bucks / what a steal!The rolls are tasty, the sunrise drink is great too! Most of all, our server was HILARIOUS and told us the bill was ""1375 dollars"" when we asked for it. What a thrill. The ice cream is free with Yelp check in too! Bad:The outdoor seating is a bit jank, because it's on the side of a road, but it's not the worst."
974,"Keepin it real out here by midtownHad a chance to visit for lunch with a coworker after seeing all the positive reviews. It was honestly not too bad but not so amazing at the same time. Took a while for the server to get to us, food was good but pretty ordinary, reasonable lunch special pricing makes up for itWould still go back but with a more realistic expectation next time"
975,"Staff was friendly and helpful. During 2021 October, vaccine cards, ID, and temperature checks are required for entry. First I would say the Ramen is excellent choice to have it was a large portion enough for sharing depending on appetite and has an authentic taste. We thoroughly enjoyed the Ramen and got some green tea ice cream. The sushi was left to be desired both soy sauce is dark (not great for sushi) and the rice felt not as much vinegar or odd in taste. Overall sushi was a bit of a downer. Relatively cheap though"
976,"Love the fast and friendly service. Wendy and Ben were attentive with everything our party of 6 needed. Whenever I'm in the big Apple next, I will be stopping by."
977,"Was able to meet up an old work colleague here, since we were BOTH traveling to NY at the same time. It's summer in NY, 90 degrees and humid, so I suggested this place since it was pretty much the middle of Times Square and Chelsea, where we were each staying, and sushi seemed like a good option.Because I'm a psychopath, I ordered spicy tonkatsu ramen on a hot and disgustingly humid day. However, I was extremely satisfied. The meat was good, some parts tender, some parts actually a little tough, but still delicious and edible. It definitely hit the spot, although it was hot. My friends ordered sushi, and they seemed to like it so no complaints there! Def a cool hole in the wall spot to pop into."
978,"Spicy Vegetable Ramen was EVERYTHING I exp Cyrene and MORE! Wenti,,,our hostess was AMAZING!! 1st time here and definitely not our last"
979,We were really wanting some sushi on one of our nights in NYC.  We had been sightseeing a few days so wanted something relatively close to our hotel that we could walk to. We found this spot on Yelp. It was great! It's a small place right in midtown. The sushi was great. Everything was super fresh. Our waitress Sandy was really friendly and attentive. They were busy but efficient. They were taking all covid restrictions seriously.  The HUGE bowls of ramen looked pretty popular too and delicious--we didn't have one but admired them.  The prices were similar to 'back home' and for midtown Manhattan that was beyond amazing! We would definitely go back.  We would have loved to get a seat at their small sushi bar because it would have been interesting to watch the making while dining. Maybe next time.
980,"Great location, wait time was appropriate.  Its completely worth waiting.  Excellent food and even better service."
981,"Egg cream, pastrami on rye oh my!   We crowded in with the mad rush after seeing a show on a Saturday night and scored a table after 10 minutes.  Our server was delightful, fun and attentive but gave us space.   The hubby and I shared an egg cream, pastrami Reuben on rye with Swiss, sauerkraut and russian on the side, fries and carrot cake cheesecake.  Needless to say, it was a lot of food but the perfect amount after all was said and done.  The egg cream was sweet, fizzy and delicious.  The pastrami was tasty, lean and great on the toasted rye with melted Swiss, tangy sauerkraut and slathered in the Russian dressing served on the side.   The fries were thick steak fries that were nice and salty.  Last came the carrot cake cheesecake.   We love carrot cake but had to get the classic since we were in NY, so why not combine the two?   The music was fun, the crowd was lively and I had such an enjoyable evening that I'll definitely be back on our next visit."
982,"Whenever I'm in New York, I always make it a point to have at least one meal here. This was the first time I was out and about early enough to get breakfast here. As always, Junior's exceeded my expectations! I ordered the Eggs Benedict with home fries. The home fries are like seasoned fries on steroids! Extra crispy on the outside and soft in the center, with plenty of surface area for the tasty seasoned goodness! The English muffin was thin and toasted crispy (IMO, most English muffins in benedicts are too thick and bready) the slice of Canadian bacon was nice and thick, the eggs were poached perfectly, but the main thing - the thing that will make or break any Benedict.... The Hollandaise sauce! This was definitely among the best of ever had. I'll definitely be back here again while I'm here so stay tuned for more stuff reviews at Junior's!!"
983,"Came here and got the french onion soup and split the chicken sandwich with a friend. French onion soup was alright but the texture of the bread is not the most palatable. Chicken sandwich was decent but not worth waiting for.Friends got the turkey with gravy and potatoes, and this could be improved greatly. Food was cold and the gravy coagulated, looking very unappetizing and the taste was not great either.Did end up getting a cheesecake since that is what this place is known for, but do have to say their cheesecakes are on the heavier side and not the best I've had."
984,"Junior's Restaurant Ratings: 4.1/5Food: 4.5/5 - My first time here with my friend at Junior's, the classic staple for cheesecake in NYC. We did not end up order cheesecake here but got their strawberry shortcake, and it was a great decision. Please see the description of the items I ordered at Junior's, but no description on the ice cream soda since I did not try it, but my friend totally recommends it. - Turkey Reuben [GET]: It is loaded with lots of turkey, topped with creamy coleslaw, and grilled swiss on rye. The bread is toasted well with butter, and crispy on the outer layer. The turkey meat is moist, juicy, and tender, but nothing too special. The swiss was a good addition, since it makes the sandwich moist, easier to eat. It was a good Reuben sandwich, but nothing too special. The thousand island dressing on the side wasn't that good, so not a fan. - Strawberry Shortcake [GET]: This cake was beautiful and phenomenal. There's two layers packed with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. The sponge cake was moist, spongy, and hella light. The whipped cream was my favorite. It got the perfect amount of sweetness, density, and amazing soft texture that literally melts in your mouth. I love the whipped cream, delicate and poised. This is perfect, and each bite was heavenly. All I can say is, it's thiccc but in a fantastic way, and I definitely finished that cake all by myself. I will return anytime just for this cake. Ambiance: 3.75/5 - This place is always bussing and busy, because it is located in the heart of Times Square and the Broadway Theater District, super touristy. There are lots of seatings in the restaurant, so the wait time isn't too bad. It is very loud though, so wouldn't be a good place for a date night. They also got a designated place for takeout orders too. Overall, Junior's got a typical diner vibe, super casual and chill. Price: 4/5 - My friend treated me to this meal, so I do not know the total. My Turkey Reuben sandwich was $18.95 and the strawberry shortcake was $8.75. I think all the prices are reasonable, especially in Times Square, NYC. We were quite full after the meal and was satisfied. Service: 4.25/5 - Attentive and efficient service here. We waited for 15 minutes and got seated. Our server was nice, and he immediately bring out water for us. He was also very prompt at taking our orders and serving the food in a timely fashion despite it being packed and busy that evening. He was down to earth and provides some good recommendation. Overall, a cheerful guy.BLUF: A staple restaurant in Times Square and known for their cheesecake. If you are visiting NYC or a local in the city, definitely give this place a try. The strawberry shortcake is something you must try. It was so freaking good, and worth all the calories. Perfect spot for dessert after a broadway show or when you want to take a break in Times Square."
985,"I think everyone knows about their famous cheesecake. It taste sooo much better in person. It is so much more creamer...bigger...and of course fresh. It is the best cheesecake I ever had in my life! They are also known for their shortcake but honestly it isn't good. It tasted too artificial. Their food portions are huge! Easily you can share your plate with another person. They are very very generous with their food. It is delicious and can see how they are also a popular restaurant. All in all, anyone who goes to New York need to stop by here"
986,"Junior's cheesecake is worth the calories!Creamy and delicious. Get the plain - so you are not distracted by other flavors - and enjoy this rich NY treat. That being said, we had a Reuben sandwich at the counter with a side of Cole slaw. The Reuben was good but not the best I have ever had. And for some reason they put the Russian dressing on the side, which I found inconvenient."
987,"Standard diner fare. Huge portions but not particularly tasty-just average, the type of place you'd go to fight off a hangover. They also took a really really long time to bring out the food, from appetizers to desserts. I had higher expectations for the cheesecake. The strawberry had way too much of the jelly stuff and used under ripened strawberries. There are far better selections for NY cheesecake."
988,Great location across from Times Square Marriott Marquis. It's a very busy breakfast spot and everyone does a good job of moving the customers in and out. Our service was okay and the food was very typical of diner food at a decent price. My omelette and grits were better than expected. My only beef was the coffee refills were slow to come and I had to ask where our food was after seeing tables seated after ours being served before us. Everything considered its all about location when your hungry and and this spot is exactly where it needs to be.
989,"A friend recommendation to try their famous cheesecake. Went for the bakery take out counter. I love how everything is so easy to navigate from their menu to the selection of cakes to look at. The location is spacious and would love to come back in the future for a dine in experience. The staff who handle the take out order was pleasant and knowledgeable. I got the original plain cheesecake (regular size-smallest whole cake). It was well packaged but most importantly, it's scrumptious! Definitely didn't waste my money on this cheesecake!"
990,"I can only speak on the cheesecake here because I've never dined in. My boyfriend and I popped by on a Saturday night looking for dessert and ended up taking home a whole fresh strawberry cheesecake. It was quite delicious and exceeded my expectations coming from a super touristy place in Times Square. The cheesecake was decadent, soft, and had the perfect ratio of creaminess to sweetness and tartness from the strawberries. I'll definitely be back to try the other flavors of cheesecake and who knows, we might dine in next time too!"
991,I'm absolutely a fan of Junior's Restaurant especially the one located in the heart of Times Square and the Broadway Theater District.A lot of folks usually come to this location after seeing a Broadway Play. Hence I found myself doing the same thing as well. They have lots of seatings in the restaurant and this huge bar. Also I wanted to mention that they have a section where you can order to go. Since I was craving for dessert and Prosecco I'd sat at the bar and enjoyed Junior's original cheesecake and I was literally sold.They are obviously known for their cheesecake and I have to say they served the most delicious cheesecake in NYC.So a slice of their original cheesecake will definitely satisfy your craving. Their cheesecake was so incredibly creamy and rich that it just leaves the best taste in your mouth. I always like the smell of their cheesecake as well for some strange reason it's cheesy smell just catches your attention immediately. I'm also a fan of their strawberry and chocolate swirled cheesecakes.I've never actually had a meal at Junior's like I said I only come for their dessert. They have some great food options. I see loads of folks ordering their hotdogs and burgers.Highly recommend visiting if you happen to be in Times Square or Brooklyn - that's where the original Junior's is located.
992,A Brooklyn classic! Junior's got me on matzoh ball soup so I gotta thank them for that. What an absolute delight on a cold New York day. Combo Reuben was solid too and paired well with the Russian dressing. Opted for a strawberry cake shake because why the heck not. It's the right move for the right occasion. Onion rings were overly bready but oh well.
993,Always fantastic cheesecake. Place is historic so no change in atmosphere. Only suggest petite cheesecake bites in a shot glass or petit fours etc. Classic is amazing still.
994,"This place is Brooklyn.Every time I want to impress an out-of-towner I take them here.Obviously you go here for the cheesecake, but the regular food is still pretty good.Service at the restaurant is always efficient and attentive.Service at the takeout counter is always a breeze."
995,"I was visiting New York and wanted to try the world famous juniors restaurant mainly because of the cheesecake. The cheesecake: we had the Cheesecake sky scraper malt shake (I think that's what it's called) with the gram cracker rim and the slice of strawberry cheesecake on top. The strawberry shake to me tasted better than the cheesecake. The cheesecake part was cool but nothing to do cartwheels over in my opinion; just didn't match the hype. I would equate it to the taste of the Cheesecake Factory. The staff at the bar, was very friendly, both my party and I had a hamburger and fries which were good as well. The rest of the desserts looked good but I was just there for the cheesecake. Overall I would go back, it's a casual atmosphere to get some good/decent food."
996,"this place is really impressive. Went for lunch on Saturday with a large group and it was super busy. The staff is on point. This place is run like a well  oiled machine! The pastrami is so good! even the BLT is done perfectly with tons of bacon on it. Milkshakes and chocolate eye creams are a must! disco fries need to be super crispy.The onion rings look good, but I think they're weird. There's way too much batter on them  and they look like doughnuts. Oh, if you come here you have to get cheesecake. My favorite actually turned out to be the blueberry I don't even get a picture of it."
997,"December 2021 - COVID Review:My husband and I called ahead while we were walking there from our hotel to be put on the waiting list for a table. You can also join the waitlist from Yelp!There's so many menu options to choose from, but as others have mentioned it is pretty pricey due to tourists and its location. It was $20 for each of our entrees!Overall the food was good and really filling though. I liked how my corned beef and pastrami combo really piled on the meat. NY-style cheesecake was what originally started my love with cheesecake so of course nobody can leave without having a slice or two either! The slices we got were extra cream cheesy :)"
998,"When in New York, Junior's is one of my favorite Diners. It is very popular as it is smack dab in the middle of Theatre District, and right across the street of The Marriot Marquis Times Square. You will see so many people coming or going to a Broadway show, or just your average NY tourist. I've ate here with groups of friends/collegues, I've ate here with my better half, and I've also dined in by myself at the bar. The bar is easiest to get seated quickly as people are always on the go. Get the cheesecake for dessert as they are known for it. You can also have your meals picked up or delivered by your favorite food delivery service. I love coming here for dinner as the crowd is full of energy and once in a while, you'll catch the entire wait staff congregate a dining table singing Happy Birthday all together!"
999,"I never thought I'd say this, but I actually kind of love Junior's. I know it's a tourist trap, but my friends visiting NYC and I always enjoy it. We go for the cheesecake, but have since discovered they have other noteworthy dishes.We all got Egg Creams, and they were delicious. The vanilla was better than the chocolate, and we even took home souvenir egg cream glasses. They use Fox's U-Bet which is the OG syrup for Egg Cream, like I mean I send my friend's New Yorker father a box of that syrup to California all the time because he swears by it. I got Disco Fries for the table which were good, but not great. They use steak fries which is a good choice and there was a good amount of cheese and gravy. I knew I wanted to save room for Cheesecake so I only got a Loaded Potato Pancake. That Potato Pancake was one of the best I've ever had. Shocking, I know, but it was truly excellent. It was well-cooked, crispy on the outside and absolutely delicious. I'd go back just for that and a slice of Cheesecake. For dessert, I got the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake. It was good, but the bottom white part was not good at all. My slice was huge, like a small family of four could split it. I asked for raspberry sauce on the side, but they didn't have it and gave me strawberry on the side, which was thoughtful.It was our waiter's second day, but James was excellent. Attentive and even brought the glasses we purchased wrapped at the end of our meal. He was excellent, and it was busy. He was so good, I told the manager and I rarely do that. I have never been to Junior's when it wasn't busy, and yet have yet to experience a long wait. Maybe I'm just lucky?"
1000,First time here and I enjoyed the experience and food. Walked in and was told there's a 15 minute wait. Took my number and texted me in 10 minutes - table ready. Checked vaccination record and ID The menu had limited pescatarian options but I managed quit well with my avocado toast and fried calamari. I never had a toasted mini hero bread but no complaints. I just wished they used large tomato slices instead of cherry tomato. The calamari was perfect- nice and hot and crispy but not chewy. The sauce was ok. The staff is excellent and know how to make guests feel welcomed. Best service with a smile I've had in awhile.
1001,"I was searching for a good breakfast spot near my hotel in Time Square and this place had great ratings. They don't take reservations so we walked up hoping for a short wait time. They were able to seat us immediately once they verified our vaccination cards and ID.As you can see in my photos, the restaurant is huge. It was packed and they kept the customers moving in and out. The service was ok. Our server was really nice. He was just really busy and so we ended up waiting for a while to ask for drinks, condiments and even the check.The food and coffee was alright. Not much to rave about. The portion was appropriate and very filling. I asked for a vanilla latte with oat milk but they could only offer me latte with almond milk.When we got the check it was over $100 for 4 people. I don't think I have ever paid so much for diner like food. There is another diner a few blocks away that is mom and pop owned, pretty big size restaurant, serves real delicious diner and breakfast food for actual diner prices. Knowing that there is another spot that does it better for a fraction of the price leads me to rating this place a 3 star."
1002,"Honestly we came to this location because some ppl suggested it. Otherwise we would not have stop by. Luckily, it was only two of us so we only waited about 20 minutes. I would suggest that you join the waitlist if possible. We called ahead and they were able to add us on the phone. The service was slow but I mean it is a very popular restaurant. At least the server was nice. The menu is overwhelming because there's so many choices. I had the chicken BLT sandwich as my husband had the corned beef. He really enjoyed his sandwich and he is a sandwich lover, so I'd suggest it. Mine was aight. A bit dry. The cheesecake was indeed yummy! I'd suggest you go to the bakery if you just want to try the cheesecake and avoid the waiting game for aight food. Enjoy!"
1003,"Seems to me I'm just a speck in the wind with comments about Juniors Cheesecake. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area. My wife was talking about finding a really good cheesecake. My search started, ordered the large combo and all are amazing.Shipping was good, arrived frozen. I'm eating the last slice now and will miss this cheesecake. So very good. You won't be disappointed."
1004,"Oooh yeah baby...get down low, let's shake it. Shake it up...we're about to mix some cheesecake with some milkshake. If you're here, you might as well do it right. Shake it, shake it up. Do as the Broadway dancers do here, get down and shake it up and order whatever your heart desires because you're going to want everything on the menu.As I am trying to decide what to order, my head kept turning around looking at all the food and drinks being served. Oooh, that Swiss mushroom burger with steak fries looks so slammin' good.I would say their food is diner/cafe with a Jewish flare. They have apps, soups, sandwiches, burgers, cakes, shakes, egg cream sodas, coffee, lattes, breakfast items, and of course their World Famous Cheesecakes with so many flavors to choose from it will make your head spin. If you're worried about counting calories, share a slice, which is what we did along with some Disco fries (which is topped with melted mozzarella, mushroom & gravy). The toppings seem so wrong but taste so right. You get my drift (wink, wink).The decor is groovy with a cool 50's vibe. Service was out of sight given how busy they were. The original Junior's is located in Brooklyn and has been opened since 1950.With a portrait of Barbra Streisand in the women's restroom and Frank Sinatra playing, it can't get any more New York than this."
1005,"This should really be a three star review, but the servers go above and beyond to make you feel at home through quick service and casual banter. The food is just average. But the cheesecakes is where it's at here.The Devil's Food Cake Cheesecake: cheesecake layered with Devil's Food Cake. A chocolate and cheesecake lover's dream come true. The chocolate cake layers are always moist (I've had it twice). Nothing worse than dry cake.The Red Velvet Cheesecake: servers will recommend it unanimously; Yelp reviews will, too; then your taste buds will completely agree--best cheesecake here. Thin layers of red velvet cake with huge layers of cheesecake and cream cheese. The Cheesecake Factory's version pales in comparison to this one.Now for the cheesecake shakes...The Brownie Explosion Shake: Brownie Explosion cheesecake dipped in a vanilla ice cream shake, with a vanilla frosting rim and chocolate sauce to finish off the masterpiece. Very indulgent. The epitome of ""treating yourself."" Not for the faint of heart and totally for devoted dessert goers.Coffee: horrible.Food: Get the Fried Chicken Platter or eat elsewhere. Seriously.There you have it; my review of Manhattan's most iconic diner. The perfect spot for some dessert after a Broadway show or after dinner elsewhere."
1006,"The first thing we did when we arrived in New York City was visit Times Square. It was going to be around lunch time, so I spent some time beforehand on Yelp looking for a place around there to get lunch. I wanted somewhere that felt a just touristy enough (it is Times Square after all) but also be good. I decided on Junior's because the menu is extensive and filled with pages of diner food. Burgers, pastrami, soups, salads, other sandwiches ,and tons of desserts. I got the grilled cheese, and it was huge and stuffed with cheese. My only complaint is I prefer thin fries, but they were still ok. My husband got the cheeseburger and enjoyed it. Their cheesecake menu and milkshakes all looked so yummy. I was too full to try one, but I had hoped to come back to take something to go.I was happy with our experience here. (Plus, we also met a couple who sat beside us who live across the river and said they love Juniors.)"
1007,Phil offered us a selection of great options and great jokes. Wonderful service matched with  delicious food.
1008,"Junior's is known for their cheesecake and you should only ever go for that. I made the mistake of having lunch here and highly do not recommend this place. I ordered a soup and sandwich. The matzoh ball soup was average. It tasted like salty water with minimal flavor. I also had the open turkey sandwich, and that was atrocious. It's a turkey sandwich drenched in mushroom gravy and served with cranberry sauce. Sounds good in theory. However, the gravy came out cold and gelatinous. I sent it back so they could reheat the gravy. They just added lukewarm gravy on top, but left the cold gravy on the side. It was inedible. Their chicken sandwich was also okay. I also ordered their raspberry swirl cheesecake. The cheesecake was average. Fluffy with little crust. The flavor was a bit too flour-y for my liking. We shared this with a table of four and the general consensus was that the cheesecake was just okay."
1009,"Wanted to eat at juniors because I wanted to try the cheesecake and see what the hype was about. I totally didn't remember that I ate here back in 2010 on a trip with my high school band. Obviously it was a totally different experience for me this time. Be sure to have your ID and Covid vaccination card ready. My fiancé and I walked right on in and got a table on a Tuesday night. The service was pretty fast and efficient. Our waiter was very nice and had great recommendations. We ordered a few drinks then our food. The drinks were strong! For food I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with fries and onion rings and fiancé ordered the salmon with vegetables and florentine rice. Everything was very good. We had no complaints. The prices do seem a little steep, but otherwise everything was great. For dessert we shared a slice of original cheesecake. It was good but it wasn't better than any other cheesecake I've ever had. Pretty sure I'd visit again!"
1010,"We came to Junior's to grab their famous Cheesecake to-go and was able to place our order pretty quickly! The restaurant space itself is HUGE and there seemed to be a decent amount of tables around 9pm in peak holiday season. The energy is very much a nice busy diner/background chatter.As for the cheesecake -- while I am not at all disappointed and do think it is better than some other famous Cheesecake/dessert places around NYC, I was also not as impressed as I might have expected from the rave! Not bad, not the-most-amazing-cheesecake I've ever had either. Would come back if I was in the area and craving sweets!"
1011,"The strawberry cheesecake. It haunts my dreams. Its was thick but fluffy, decadent but not too sweet. I cannot imagine how I would improve upon this slice. My only complaint is I want more but I am no longer in NYC."
1012,"Food - bomb Service - better than any high class boujie restaurant in nyc Drinks - great!! Dessert- cheese cake specifically THE F-ing best.Our server was Ashley, short hair, super nice and so on top of all her tables!!! Thank you. This was our last stop before flying back home. The best send off, thank you!! :-)"
1013,"Dropped by Junior's my first night in NYC - because I had to try the monstrosity (in a good way!) of a cheesecake float that ""The New Yorker"" is. It's simply ridiculous (in a good way!), and I'm the kind of person that lives to try over-the-top foods like it. At $17 a pop, it's not cheap - but I figure, you're paying for a slice of cheesecake AND a milkshake AND a hilarious photo-op. Once in a while? Worth it.To be honest, the float isn't one you get for taste. The cheesecake was topped with artificial strawberry gel (tastes heavily processed), which isn't my jam... and the cheesecake itself was too dense and a bit mealy. The graham crackers along the milkshake glass were a bit stale and clearly for show, more than anything else. I wouldn't be surprised if people had prepared the glasses in advance expecting tourists to buy the shakes. The milkshake itself was actually my favorite part - same artificial strawberry flavor, but I'm a fan of it in milkshake form... reminds me of the strawberry milk I had as a kid. Mmmmmm.So why the 4 stars? Well, you ain't gonna find anything like it anywhere else, and it was a hilarious photo. Plus, even if the taste isn't the most refined, it's hard to go wrong with cheesecake and a milkshake. Service was quick, even though the place was really busy. I probably wouldn't go again for myself, but I certainly would if I were showing a friend around."
1014,It is a crime what they do to this corned beef and pastrami.   Gross leathery garbage.   And they didn't provide pickle or the Russian dressing I asked for. I weep for the poor cow.
1015,"We were across the street for a convention and thankful this happening & busy little spot was close! My hubby was craving breakfast & I wanted a ""real lunch"" and Junior's didn't disappoint! We had the combo pastrami & corned beef ruben... can you say ""YES PLEASE?!"" It was served hot very quickly and stacked full of deliciousness. They served large sliced pickles, pickled beets on the side as well as the traditional thousand island dressing... so you could smother it or just scrape it on- nice!! My hubby decided against breakfast and went for the Disco Fries...thick cut fries covered in mushroom gravy & melted mozzarella cheese- grab your fork quick for this salty, not healthy for you but you can't quit-eating it-pile-of-fries! He also tried the French Dip sandwich which we agreed was piled high with meat & toppings included with soft bread! We were so full we didn't order any cheesecake or dessert but hoping to next trip! Felt like we ""participated"" in a long term,  classic spot in NY! A side note... we heard one of the most amazing renditions of happy birthday to a nearby table.  After realizing most servers there were trying to ""make it big"" ... there was some amazing talent there and had some fun conversing with various servers who were quick to visit with any type of interest!! Fun- maybe we met someone before famous hahaha!!"
1016,I only got the cheesecake and it is super rich and not that good. I may have a taste that I am used too. I love cheesecake factory but also local cheesecake shops. Juniors just was not worth it. I will stick with the local shops.
1017,"What an ethereal experience overall! Upon entering, a grand diner, hostess at the booth in front. Astute and attentive I was given an option for a table, quickly I ran to the bar! Met a gentleman with longer hair, smooth talking, and knowledgeable about his craft! Sophia also there helped make a tourist feel at home.Bloody Mary's were made with the most fresh Bloody Mary mix from that morning. An olive and peppercini to top it off. First sip, woo!, I'm ready for another! So I had a second Bloody Mary!The beets were delicious! Pickles and slaw quite on the sour side if that's your flavor, usually mine too, but loved the sweetness and tartness of the beets.Ordered the skirt steak with mashed potatoes, Mac n cheese, with the gravy on the side. Boy I wish I had a bucket of that gravy and mash. The gravy was savory, meaty, melt if your mouthy! The gravy topped on the mash on point, gravy with the mac and cheese amazing, gravy with the pickles, still good, and finally the gravy with the steak, try the gravy with the steak and let me know how it leaves your mouth and enters your gullet wishing that euphoria was everlasting.Every last bite was taken as I overheard a slew of cheesecake descriptions coming from the bar directed at another customer. Was I full, but there's always room for desert!Ordered a coffee with the Strawberry Cheesecake! Best cheesecake ever! Best coffee ever! Coffee smooth, low acidity, no bitterness whatsoever. Complement the sweetness of the cheesecake, the creaminess that melded the coffee and cream cheese together in my mouth. My mouth is watering as I am writing the description. I wish I could share the feeling in my mouth and brain from my experience. (Gross?) who knows but it was delicious!With bites left, Bloody Mary dry, and minutes from the afternoon showing of the Lion King an order of the macallan 12 yr to brighten the noon happened. Cheesecake and macallan let me tell you! Maccallan smooth, sweet, sherry oak cheese cake melted and the two flavors joined in a symphony that created fireworks of each and every tastebud. The ethereal feeling better than the steak and gravy. Coffee finished, cheesecake finished, steak devoured, mac n cheese vanished, mash potatoes/gravy regurgitated and eaten again it's that good (okay that one was gross), Bloody Mary x2 flowing through the veins meeting the macallan for one final dance before moving on to the King!Thank you Juniors team keep up the great work.Short Story: During my aggressive eating of the steak the knife had fallen mid bite nearing my foot. Before I could finish my bite the knife was picked up and replaced. Excellent excellent I could keep eating without missing a beat, thanks for keeping me big!"
1018,"Date of visit: 8/6/21On a trip to NYC a few years ago we had a chance to hit up the Junior's in Brooklyn for a massive dinner the likes of which I feel I haven't seen since. So we wanted to take the opportunity to try out the Times Square/Broadway location when we had our moms with us for this trip as well as try them out for breakfast.Service was a bit slow, but I suspect they were just a little overwhelmed with NYC reopening and the crowds surpassing their staffing levels, not unlike most other places these days. Our waiter did the best he could, but it was obvious that he could not keep up with everything that the day was throwing at him.Thankfully we weren't in a hurry and when the food arrived, it was all really good! My mom loved her blintzes and my pancakes were top-notch. Though I actually think the warm applesauce may have been my highlight, I forgot how much I love that apple and cinnamon combo!One other issue: It was FREEZING in there, and we were sitting outside! The AC was just blasting out onto the patio, making me wish I had brought a coat despite the 80 degree weather."
1019,This place is really good. I mean REALLY GOOD. First of all the inside is great and really clean and so are the bathrooms. The food is also great the bacon is better than most breakfast places and the pancakes are huge. They also have more drinks than the normal stuff like coffee and orange juice they have milkshakes and more! Even though it is one of the busiest places it is one of the hardest working. The staff is super nice and really helpful. The location is also great near Times Square and other theaters. This will be one of my favorite memories of NYC. Can't recommend it enough.
1020,This is my favorite breakfast place in Times Square.  Try to arrive before 9 AM during the weekends to avoid a line.  The portions are huge and service is very friendly and somewhat fast.  I really like their corned beef hash.  It tastes fresh and like how they mince the meat.  Next door you can buy cheesecake and cake slices to go.  Got my pumpkin pie cheesecake!
1021,"Visited for breakfast and the service was awful. In fact, after waiting 10 minutes to be greeted by one of the managers to take our order.  She took our order and the waiter came by and asked if someone took our order. I informed him that our order was placed. And I asked for a refill for my soda. After that refill he never engaged with us to see if our food was okay or if we needed anything. I had to ask him three times for our check as he walked past us ignoring me. The waiter was definitely a diva and should have not been working in the service industry.  However, the food was great ..."
1022,"We had the best service! Our waiter was fast and friendly with great suggestions! We all enjoyed what we ordered. All portion sizes were large, you could split some of these items! We didn't care for the onion rings, they had very thick breading and lacked flavor but everything else was good! We did get cheesecake that we forgot to take pics of lol but it was very good; sweet but not too sweet. Great casual dining place with good prices and drinks."
1023,"Second time for breakfast here, surprisingly more crowded on a Monday morning versus Saturday morning. Staff and management are friendly and approachable. Food was delish. They do have a take-out bakery door connected to the restaurant off the alley AND a bakery counter in the restaurant."
1024,This place has some amazing and fantastic matzoh ball soup. It hit the spot big time and was so tasty to start or finish any meal. Then comes the cheese cake. I felt culinarily spoiled to have the honor to already enjoy my matzoh ball soup and finish it with some cheesecake. What a wonderful treat.
1025,Cheesecake is the best and it is what we always get whenever we visit the city. Customer service is good with no complaints. We were in and out without issue.
1026,Delicious!!! Absolutely loved this place everything was delicious! Our server was Elias super sweet and very helpful always made sure you were doing good! Total we paid $65 for everything that's in the picture and honestly it's not expensive. That hot cocoa was yummy! We loved everything about this place and also super clean ! If you're from NYC or from out of town this place is a must! Thank you Junior's for your amazing service and food
1027,"Great, friendly night dining. It is one of the only places OPEN after 10 PM in Times Square, which as a tourist, was kind of strange because I always thought this city was called ""the city that never sleeps"". However if you sit at one of the long counters the wait staff basically ignore you. If you sit at a table they serve you right away. Did not like that. But the food was yummy, old fashioned diner type food."
1028,"Juniors was across the street from our hotel so we decided to see why Diddy sent them kids across the bridge for some cheesecake.  Just like most places in NYC they asked for our licenses and Vaccine cards before we were allowed in which was fine by me. We were greeted & seated quickly. The menu was decent. I even took the chance of ordering an espresso martini. It was pretty good. My bf and I split the chicken sandwich and the bacon cheeeseburger. They were both ok. The onion rings were trash. I'm glad the were Garnish and we didnt pay for them. We decided to end our visit with the Carrot cake cheesecake. It was also just ok. Maybe stick with the original flavor. Overall, the experience was great but it wasn't bad either. I guess just manage your expectations. Also, If you are seated near the windows in the winter prepare to be warm! I ended up taking off some layers for comfort."
1029,Hands down the best cheesecake I had in NYC. So fresh and flavorfull and not to sweet just how a perfect cheesecake should be. I wish they had a location in Cali
1030,"This is my wife's favorite cupcake spot in NYC.  I didn't know much about it but wanted to give it a try. The storefront doesn't have much to it and it took me a second to find it honestly. Once inside I noticed the cupcakes were in a glass case. It looks more like a coffee shop than a cupcake place honestly. They have a bunch of cupcakes though and they are all themed. I tried a few different ones. The chocolate decadence was solid but the cinnamon roll cupcake took the cake!  They recommend putting it in the microwave for 15 seconds before eating. It was one of the better cupcakes I have had and a must order! $20 for 5 cupcakes. Welcome to NY.  Overall, the cake part of the cupcake is very good on all of them.  A lot of the cupcakes have filling inside if you are into that. I forget the names of the other ones we got. I think I tried the smores one and some peanut butter one. Check this place out and definitely try the cinnamon roll cupcake that is on the counter!"
1031,"What's not to love about Molly's? Great cupcakes every time, and thoughtful frostings (not just weird grainy sugar). Even for those that aren't big cupcake fans, I'd recommend trying the banana cupcake. The peach cobbler is also delicious! Such fun flavor profiles and great execution. Plus wonderful atmosphere. Highly recommend."
1032,"I've been to the Molly's cupcakes in Chicago and I absolutely love them. For sure one of my favorite cupcakes! I was super stoked to see that they had an NYC location too. This time, I ordered the blueberry cheesecake and it was incredible. The graham crack/cheesecake on top is the best part! I wish they even stuffed the core of the cupcake with it too since it's so yummy lol. The base of the cupcake, the cake part itself, is always moist, flavorful, and doesn't feel like an afterthought. I love the swings at the counters (though right now they are blocked off). Seems like it's a staple at Molly's locations because the Chicago one had them too."
1033,"My friend and I went to New York last month, and we happened to chanced upon Molly's Cupcakes. This wasn't part of our itinerary, but it was definitely worthy stop. We availed the Cake Batter, Blueberry Cheesecake, and Boston Cream. I'd have to say that my favourites were the centre-filled ones, Cake Batter and most especially the Boston Cream. The cupcake itself had just the right amount of sweetness to compliment with its frostings and fillings. I also liked the Blueberry Cheesecake for its very straightforward taste.Overall, I can't wait to go back!!!"
1034,"Molly's Cupcakes for the dessert win! Molly's, is serious about cupcakes, and I am not complaining. These Cupcakes are no joke good! At Molly's they fashion their cupcakes to mimic or rather enhance the taste of your already favorite dessert. Like creme brûlée, peach cobbler, birthday cake, blueberry cheese cake, s'mores, Samoa, Boston cream pie.... The list goes on. Whenever we are in the village, we stop on in, and pick up a few. My favorites are the peach cobbler, and the Boston cream pie. The price point per cupcake is under $4 which is a great deal. The size of each  cupcake is pretty large. The cupcakes are always super fresh and delicious. They have dine in options, they also have coffee & tea selections.You can always take your cupcakes to go. The staff is friendly and are open to questions. Molly's also offers build your own cupcakes options. *They have a customer restroom in the back.*Molly's is located near the West 4th subway lines A, C, & F trains. Go check out Molly's Cupcakes, you won't be disappointed."
1035,"Delicious cupcakes! These cupcakes are so good that we came back twice in one week for more. We tried several flavors, and all are delicious but my favorite is the peach cobbler. Oh my goodness? If you love peach cobbler this cupcake is for you. The staff is very polite and they don't mind explaining the menu favorites.At the time of our visits they did not have indoor seating but the mayor & governor are opening up seating soon. So check with Molly's prior to visiting, if you plan on sitting. We are not ready for in door seating, so we grabbed our cupcakes to go. We had some across the street at the open air park, and took the rest home.Go get some treats, you deserve it! Yes you!"
1036,"These are some seriously good cupcakes holy snap. I don't think I've ever had a cupcake that I enjoyed as much as the blueberry cheesecake cupcake. I've always thought of cupcakes as something that you just sort of get when you don't want to slice a cake, but this is actually a desert in and of itself. Well decorated, nicely moist and actually evoked all the flavors of a blueberry cheesecake."
1037,"Believe the hype, peeps. Every. Single. Thing. here is delectable. Every bite was savored. Every bite was adored... Miss Molly, thank you for being the inspiration behind these treats. The world is a better place because of you."
1038,Came by recently with a friend since we were looking for desserts near the nyu area. I got the caramel cupcake and my friend ordered the tiramisu. Both were moist and the fillings so delicious. Everything honestly looked and sounded great but we could only eat so much. The ambiance inside is cute too and they don't rush you out although you probably shouldn't linger here forever. They also have a bathroom which is nice.
1039,"Everything has been amazing multiple visits! Molly's has wonderful flavor selections, and it's also fun to pick out your own cake/frosting combinations. It's also handy they have different sizes. When I worked in the area, this was my go-to for special occasions like birthday parties, and people always took seconds! The cupcakes are consistently fresh. They are better than that other bakery in the West Village popularized by a certain TV show. LOL"
1040,"Delicious, affordable, and many options!! I tried creme brûlée, cake batter filled, cookie dough filled and Samoa. All four were incredible, but I'm a sucker for creme brûlée. I'm really happy I found this place--now I can bring these cupcakes for a friend's birthday or for my younger siblings. Often, I go to a bakery and only a few items are good, but that was not the case here!! While I only tried 4 cupcakes I'm sure the others are amazing as well. Oh and the cakes are moist and fresh!"
1041,"This spot has the best cupcakes I've had in the city and is one of my top dessert spot recommendations for when someone asks! Their cupcakes are so moist and well prepared and are a testament to the flavor they're representing. They come out with new flavor combinations every now and then which makes it even more special to revisit every now and then! The staff is very warm and inviting too and always have great suggestions to when I ask them for flavor recommendations. While all of their cupcakes are brilliant, my favorites so far are the Flourless Chocolate Cupcake, Peach Cobbler, Creme Brûlée and their basic Carrot Cake Cupcake with Cream Cheese Frosting"
1042,"My friend recommended this place to me so I decided to bring some to said friend for her birthday! Got the following: PB nutella, samoa, choco covered oreo, blueberry cheesecake, peach cobbler and carrot cupcake w/ brown butter frosting. One of the cupcakes was wrong when I was rushing out and checked on the train which was overcharged as it was a specialty cupcake. It was odd because the person wrote it down and still got it wrong?? Whatever, I emailed them and got refunded quickly. I know it is one cupcake but still. It was your fault for giving me the wrong cupcake and my fault for not checking lol. Anyway, the cupcakes were all delicious and would definitely recommend coming here as they have unique flavors! I love samoas so as long as they have it in stock here, I am a fan! Will definitely try the other flavors if I am ever in the area! The cupcakes are a good size too. I like the fact that you can create your own cupcake too. My friend is a diehard fan of the carrot cupcake w/ brown butter frosting which not many places have this combo. The birthday girl wish was granted! :)"
1043,"Reaffirmed that Molly's is indeed my favorite cupcake store. The crème brûlée and birthday cake flavors are the best, with pillowy soft cake and a surprise burst in the middle. The chocolate decadence and peanut butter cupcakes were drier than I expected, not sure if it's always that way. Great to bring to gatherings and for sharing!"
1044,"Cozy cupcake bakery that also has a few other baked goods. The cupcakes are customizable, but they also have pre-made creations. I tried their Samoa cupcake and was very impressed. it was very flavorful and very light. Inside there is ample seating, including a few bar swings seats.9"
1045,"Just go. You must.Cupcakes are so moist (there is no other word to describe this, sorry) and the flavors are unique. I don't find them to be sickly sweet; good balance of flavor across the cake, filling, and frosting.I have been here on several dates/times and have never encountered a horrible line. Many times there is no line. They have some swings inside which are so cute to sit on when the option is available.The creme brûlée cupcake is my absolute favorite, nothing else like it!"
1046,"In my opinion, the best cupcakes in the city hands down. They will make you tingle in places you thought you never would mmm yea"
1047,"This place is AMAZING. I've been a loyal fan for many years!! I love the creme brulee cupcake, it's my absolute favorite.  But my most recent experience is why I have decided to write a review.I placed an order for a cake - a 6 inch red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting, sprinkles on the side and ""happy birthday"" in pink! When I went to pick up my cake, they informed me the piping was in purple and I said it was fine. And since it was supposed to be a cream cheese frosting, it needed to be refrigerated, so I did as instructed right until it was time to cut the cake! When we finally cut into the cake, I was surprised to find that it looked like chocolate instead of the signature red that red velvet is known for... I'm not a fan of chocolate but I must say, they're so good that a chocolate hater like myself enjoyed this cake!! Their wonderful staff called me back two days later apologizing for the mix up ( I'm assuming the other party that received my red velvet had a slightly melted cake and called them ) and they fully refunded my cake! TLDR; I don't like chocolate cake, I got chocolate cake, I was still pleasantly delighted because they are just that good."
1048,"I can defend this statement handsdown: BEST cupcakes in Manhattan. Their classic cupcakes are absolutely delicious, red velvet and carrot are my person favorites. They also have stuffed cupcakes and cool unique ones as well. So well made and incredibly kind customer service. Can also vouch that their deal for a dozen is most affordable compared to other bakeries. If you're coming to the city for dessert, or need a pick-me-up in sugar form, Molly's cupcakes is the place to go!!"
1049,"Not a huge fan of cupcakes but wow this was surprising. All of the cupcakes I ordered were very tasty.They have a good array of flavors. I think my favorite was the blueberry cheesecake and the creme brulee. Each cupcake was moist and the sweetness was just right, not overwhelming. Would order from them again! Looking forward to trying the other flavors."
1050,"This is a cute little cupcake shop with so many options! I came here after dinner, so there weren't as many options as usual but there were still a lot of choices. I got the flourless chocolate cake cupcake and it was incredibly decadent and tasty. A bite or two is enough per serving but I would definitely recommend this bakery."
1051,"The creme brulee cupcake was crunchy at the top one of the best cup cake my friend had as a birthday gift from the set of 6. I had the classic sprinkle with blue frosting  and cream inside. Reminds me of my childhood,  I was always happy to see the colorful rainbow sprinkles on top of the pastries."
1052,"I'm rarely in the area, but when I am I stop by for a couple of cupcakes and I reccommend it all the time.   Today was my last day working in NYC, so I decided to hop on the subway and head to Mollys to gift a coworker a dozen cupcakes for her family for the holidays. I looked up the prices and flavors and was ready to pick up the dozen and a couple for me , but when I got there, the price for a dozen wasn't even close to the prices online. When I showed the store employee (later found out she was the manager)  the website and the advertised prices, she simply shrugged and said we'll update the website. When I advised her I went out of my way to come buy the cupcakes and I expected to pay the price advertised on THEIR website, she couldn't careless and went to the next customer. The cupcakes are delicious, but it's poor customer service if a business doesn't take the time to update their website and then treats the customer like they're trying to getover for simply expecting the price that they advertised."
1053,"This place is such a gem! My friend took us here when we were walking around Soho, and it exceeded my expectations as a low-key but very quality cupcake shop! Each cupcake was only $3.50 which is such a steal for the often overpriced dessert places around. Came with a wide variety of flavors, of which we picked tiramisu, creme brûlée, and cake batter (or birthday cake? The one with the blue frosting). We all loved every bite of our respective cupcake, the muffin was soft and moist and filled with a rich and delightful filling that gave it so much flavor. The best part was that the frosting wasn't too sweet and overwhelming, really letting the filling shine through. Great presentation and service, would definitely come here for another treat."
1054,"The BEST cupcakes! Have had them for my birthday every year since trying them a few years ago. The specialty filled ones are too good. And the minis are delicious as well. Has the classics, and gets inventive with their delicious flavors as well. Thanks Molly's!"
1055,The best cupcakes in the city! Boston cream and cake batter are really delicious and they are not overly sweet.
1056,Yummy cupcakes from Molly's cupcakes in Downtown NYC area Amazing bakery with great flavors..In this pic- order from top to down1) Cake batter - vanilla confetti2) Chocolate (vegan)3) Cookies and Cream4) Chocolate decadence (yumm)5) S'mores6) Salted Caramel Butterscotch(yumm).They are hanging in there in these tough times - hope some of you can pay a visit....
1057,"Molly's still have the very best cupcakes! Recently, we had the pleasure of receiving some from family after a gender review and it was amazing! We got the cake batter cupcakes and just at first glance it looked really good. It was a task to wait to eat it after dinner! The cake itself is moist, the filling is delicious and the frosting is light and not as sweet as it looks. My usual go to's at Mollys is the creme brulee and blueberry cheesecake but the cake batter now is my third favorite! The kids loved it, my parents loved it and it is definitely a crowd favorite."
1058,"Had Molly's cupcakes again after a long time. The interior has been updated but it still retains the relaxing feel of a mom and pop shop with a basic decor and a low key feel. In terms of their cupcakes, they are not that big - similar in size to the ones at Magnolia, but better tasting. The cake portion was very moist and the frosting had a very rich, buttery taste to it. They have increased the amount of creative flavors they offer with choices like cheesecake, pumpkin, tiramisu, boston cream and apple pie. I have only tried a few of their cupcakes, but can confirm that the red velvet and lemon meringue (filled with a lemon curd) were two I liked a lot."
1059,"I was lucky that I happened to have dinner nearby and still had a room to eat dessert other than tea/coffee(little unusual for me ). Anyways, I happened to come across this place upon looking it up on yelp and decided to give it a try. My friend ended up getting 5 for to go, I just got 2 (and of course regretted after...). I highly recommend trying the creme brûlée! It was soooooo good! This place is probably one of the top three cupcake places I have tried so far:)! Will definitely visit again!"
1060,My favorite cupcake place in NYC!  The peach cobbler cupcake is my favorite.  So yummy!
1061,Delicious cupcakes and they're always fresh. I also like that they can be delivered via door dash etc
1062,"Back in the city and back at Molly's! This place is dangerously good... to your waistline.  We ordered four to go ( chocolate peanut butter, chocolate raspberry, crepe brûlée, and salted caramel butterscotch). They not only top the cakes but they infuse the centers. They are so rich and flavorful and moist.  I've gone from meh on cupcakes to making this a stop when in the city. Molly's is doing it right!"
1063,"***BEST CUPCAKE SPOT***Magnolia Bakery - move your dry cupcakes aside because these decadent, moist cupcakes are everything you want in a cupcake. I'm tooting my own horn but I make amazing chocolate cake so I'm often disappointed by cakes and cupcakes I've had elsewhere. This place is better than what I make at home so I don't have any plans to spend $50 on ingredients to make cupcakes that can't compete with Molly's."
1064,"The creme brulee cupcake - still the best!After an introduction to the Molly's creme brulee cupcake at the Chicago Lincoln Park location, I've returned to this cupcake on multiple occasions including in the $100+ cake form for a baby shower, and on this occasion, to mark our first trip back to Manhattan (or any travel whatsoever) during the coronavirus era.During this coronavirus-era visit, ordered the creme brulee cupcakes from a register at the door and carried them as the nightcap to an outdoor dinner.  Crunchy sugar shell gives way to rich cream and a moist crumb - the cake is what sets Molly's apart from other chichi donut joints which pile the frostings upon a stale cake.Will return.  Location TBA."
1065,"This place was a surprise in more ways than one!Went for the smores themed cupcake, the mini carrot cake with cream cheese frosting, and their flourless chocolate cupcake. I was looking forward to the girl scout one the most but it turn3; out to be the most disappointing. It was one of those desserts where it has a bunch of stuff thats sounds all good and gravy but then it's just flat and doesn't really come together when you bite into it. To my surprise the other two were a hit and I was glad I got them!The flourless chocolate cupcake reminded me of a brownie in both color, texture, and flavor! Some places can't get their flourless cakes to taste great but Molly's sure did. Same with the carrot cake I got, even though it was prettymuch just carrots and cinnamon which is the bare minimum, it still tasted like a great cake. The cream cheese frosting was a bit on the saltier side so I think they add more cream cheese than usual cream cheese frosting recipes but I wasn't complaining about it in combination with all the other sweetness going around.One thing I'd change here is to get bigger plates. The ones here are meant to hold one cupcake only but that's very unideal for people who want to try more than one(who wants to manage more than one plate??) and a business should encourage that.This place has got my attention for solely having good cake which is hard to come by. I don't care for the buttercream frostings as much but at this place I can choose others! Next time I'll go for their most popular which is the cake batter."
1066,THESE! CUPCAKES! ARE! WONDERFUL!!I wasn't planning on coming here but just passed by the shop amd I couldn't just ignore it can I?!!I went in and oh my all the selections!All of their cupcakes just looked like a masterpiece. It was a hard decision but I went with the samoa and creme brulee! The staff were friendly and gave a high recommendation of the creme brûlée cupcake so had to go for it.And the taste! They taste amazinggg! I was worried it would be toooo sweet but it was the right amount! Best cupcake so far
1067,"Molly's is still the best. Stopped in recently to try some of the seasonal fall flavors. The Pumpkin spice was decent but not my favorite, maybe a little dry. The apple pie, however, was amazing. Loved the apple pie filling! Samoa cupcake was great, too."
1068,"Ordered from Molly's for a birthday celebration at my office.  Pietra was very helpful answering my questions over email as I finalized my order.  Please note their current menu online isn't totally up to date - they no longer make chocolate covered Oreos or the seven layer bars.  You can get the center filled cupcakes in mini size as long as you order a dozen of the flavor.  After going through yelp reviews & photos, I decided on ordering mini cupcakes in the crème brulee, cake batter and Samoa flavors as they seemed to be some of the most populars.  I also did a dozen mini cupcakes in classic flavors (chocolate/vanilla/red velvet), a dozen cake pops (milk chocolate & dark chocolate), and some of their rice krispie treats.  The Samoa and cake batter cupcakes were big hits.  I had high hopes for the Crème Brulee based off of yelp reviews but a lot of the berries fell off the cupcakes in transit and the caramelized sugar topping got a bit hard.   The cake pops were great and very rich.  The rice krispie treats are HUGE; those also could've been a little bit fresher.  I'd definitely try ordering from Molly's again - they have lots of fun flavors to try.  For $20, they will deliver in NYC.  I wish I took photos but my colleagues jumped right in once they were put out!"
1069,"Molly's Cupcakes is awesome. I've used them twice - once for a work event and once for a friends birthday. Both times I placed an order over the phone and it was a super easy process.For my work event, they wrote the number ""15"" on 50 cupcakes perfectly. I think the pricing was reasonable, and for $20 they were delivered to my event in perfect condition. They were super delicious and everyone loved them.Most recently, I ordered a confetti cake batter cake (made like the cupcake) for a friends birthday and she really enjoyed it. I really like the idea of cake batter instead of frosting inside the cake. Any cupcake flavor can be turned into a cake, and I'll definitely be back for future occasions!"
1070,"Some of the best, most unique cupcakes in the city. Absolutely delectable. And at a very reasonable price point too. Treat yourself!"
1071,Got the Ron Bennington cupcake and would say it was pretty solid. The peanut butter had some saltiness to it and the chocolate was pretty nice and dark. Definitely some solid cupcakes.
1072,"Last minute cancellationSadly, they cancelled a birthday order last minute BY EMAIL (for today!) and no one would pick up the phone. Would think twice if you're planning for a big event. No explanation. Just a very upset birthday boy"
1073,Best cupcake and cake I have ever had!!! The creme brûlée one is to die for! Their store is also so so cute! The staff is friendly and very helpful! Highly recommend a visit here! You won't regret!
1074,"Fell in love with their cupcakes! Their cupcakes are so moist, creative and not overwhelmingly sweet, unlike the other cupcakes in this city. Their frosting is light and the cupcake itself is fluffy with filling inside. My favorite was the peach cobbler cupcake, but the cookie dough and Creme brûlée are really delicious as well. Looking forward to trying out more of their flavors!"
1075,Omg their cupcakes are absolutely amazing! They aren't super sweet I could literally each 12 cupcakes all by myself. And their designs are super cute! I am definitely coming back for more. And I have to take better pictures of these beautiful cupcakes!
1076,"What a surprise I was given! A little box of Molly's Cupcakes. They were fresh baked that morning. The box has six mini cupcakes. Two Carrot, two Vanilla, and two Red Velvet. The first one I tried was Carrot. I found this to be the favorite of the three. Funny, I'm definitely not a fan of Carrot Cake. I don't know why this tasted delicious to me. The second one I tasted was the Red Velvet. I'm not a fan of Red Velvet either. The Red Velvet is one of Molly's most popular flavors in Chicago! I didn't think it was anything special. I still need to try the Vanilla. To give you a little more details. I love the icing. It reminds me of my other cupcake shop that has a delicious Buttercream Icing. The tiny chocolate bits on the top of each cupcake really add to the flavors. I recommend you give Molly's a try if you are a fan of cupcakes. I'm not in this neighborhood very often. I was thrilled to be treated to this beautiful box of tiny delights. There's lots of exotic flavors to choose from. You can check their website for a complete list. I hope you drool looking at my photos!"
1077,"Cute little spot for cupcakes. Ordered the lemon one that was topped with a fluffy light cream. Not too heavy, and the cake part was moist."
1078,"Delicious! Molly's is such a reliable go to. My favourite is the key lime pie but the red velvet is also amazing. The staff are always so lovely and fun, which given how busy they always are is incredible!"
1079,Blueberry cheesecake cupcake vs Cake Batter cupcake .Both we're good but I'd say the winner is the Cake Batter cupcake! It's the best seller cupcake at here & it sure lives up to its expectation!!! The cupcake is super moist & has a surprise cake batter filling inside that spews out after the first bite! Loved it! The blueberry cupcake was good but it was a bit dry which is why I wasn't a fan of it. .This bakeshop also has a really cute grammable seating area to enjoy your cupcakes on! It's like siting on a swing but worrying about moving & falling off!
1080,"This place is very cute. As soon as you walk in, you'll notice all these clever wall decor signs with funny phrases. The store feels like a meme itself.They specialize in rice puddings. One of their most popular flavor is the panna cotta. You can purchase their puddings in 5 sizes with the smallest being 8oz all the way up to 80oz. We got the panna cotta in an 8oz and thought it was already too much to share between 3 people. It was very rich and heavy so I couldn't eat too much in one setting. They also have the ""Diva"" cups which are 5oz but it's only for limited flavors (cheesecake, chocolate chip, cinnamon, caramel). I would not come here by myself because the 8oz serving size is too big and a bit expensive. If they have the diva cup for each flavor then I would probably eat here more often. Recommend taking a group of friends to share when you're here.They used to allow you to sample but due to covid, they stopped sampling."
1081,"Great name and concept, but too pricey given you can't try before you buy. I am not sure if that's a Covid consideration or standard practice. Unable to taste we ended up with one flavor that was great (peach mango) and two that were so so (vanilla and cinnamon toast). The portions were large and it was more rice pudding than we expected but when you only really like a third of it, $14 something is a lot. The dishes were nice but it was unclear if they were cleaning and reusing them I hope they do otherwise that would be a lot of wasted plastic. I agree with other reviews that while some of the sayings that decorated the store were cute, many were cringe worthy."
1082,"Went for rice pudding and instead was served heaven in a bowl. Any flavor, any size, just get it. I've been coming here for years with my family and it's never disappointed. Kicks any store bought rice pudding so far into a gutter."
1083,"I've always loved Mexican rice pudding so I wanted to give this a try and I was not disappointed! I'll admit the rice looks very unappealing, but don't let that stop you from trying it!My friend and I got chocolate chip and rocky road. While it was kind of expensive (~$10), the serving is HUGE. We finished about 1/4 and then had to take the rest home. I'll definitely be going bto try some of their fruity flavors!"
1084,Ok so. Let's talk rice. Love this concept and this idea and the staff was really nice but it was so hard picking a flavor because there are no samples. Honestly the rice is really expensive for what you are getting especially since most of them are sweet but come in a big portion that's no realistic to eat on your own. Def go and try it with some friends!
1085,"I love this place! I live in LA and dream of rice pudding because there is not anything like it here. Used to get to go to NY very frequently and this was just a must - sadly, my pre-pandemic work travel is null (sad, sad). But, if you are there, step in and enjoy the fun!"
1086,"Oh my gosh. Who knew rice pudding could taste so delicious?!One visit to this store will convert you to a fan. I love reading the funny aphorisms plastered all over the stickers and magnets on the walls as decor. They deliver a healthy dose of humor with dessert.The flavors here are numerous. I spotted a seasonal pumpkin flavor but went with the French toast. The flavor was spot on! It tasted like a slice of cinnamon French toast with syrup and butter. The rice is soft and gummy, so easy on the palate, that you might be surprised to find that you ate the whole tub by yourself."
1087,"I love arroz con leche and rice pudding is something I don't see very often sold in a variety or at a place of its own, so I was surprised to have seen this place while out in soho. There are plenty of flavors and it's in a nice area with seating inside and outside. There were a couple of flavors I wanted to try like the Oreo flavor but I went with the original and it was pretty good. With a little cinnamon on top it wasn't too sweet and it had a great texture so it was enjoyable as a snack on a warm day."
1088,"If you love rice pudding, this is the place to visit. They have so many delish flavors. Milky deliciousness. Only thing is they don't let you do is try first. So if it's too rich. You're stuck with it. I tried the 'sex drugs and rocky road' mixed with the 'man made mascarpone'. So so yummy. They also have teas and coffees. Definite must try!"
1089,"I have been wanting to try this place for a few months now but I'm rarely in this area. So I forgot about it. Last week, I stopped into Van Leeuwen and then randomly walked passed this place! With ice cream already in hand I had to stop into Rice to Riches. I really couldn't take it all because I was still in shock that I had even found the place. The decor is really unique. It was bright inside. We asked for a recommendation and the guy working there was chatty and funny. We got the cheesecake with coconut toppings. I would've gotten 2 flavors but I was so unprepared to come here and so overwhelmed lol. (I didn't get to check Yelp first). The serving size is huge. It was spilling over I think it's more than enough for 2 people. I also think you NEED to add toppings. I mean the rice pudding itself is delicious it's so rich and creamy and the coconut flakes with the crunch ..wow. Also I think the container it comes in is reusable which is really nice. I'll def be back here to try more flavors but for the 10 minutes I was in there I was really impressed, this place lived up to the hype !"
1090,"Thursday's Kitchen is one of my favorite fusion tapas restaurants in the city! First the food, the flavors are so rich and fast - my favorite dishes are the paella and truffle Mac. The capri funs are also a must try for beverages. The environment is fun and trendy and there is usually a wait on the weekends if you come after 6 so try to plan ahead!"
1091,"The food here was very solid. The truffle mac was super creamy and rich, almost a bit too rich, needed something to balance it out. The kimchi paella also had so much seafood flavor. Very close to giving this a 5."
1092,"Love the overall concept of Korean tapas! My favorites were the Edamame Dumplings, Kimchi Paella, and Soft Shell Crab. The Edamame Dumplings were such a surprise, the filling was super creamy, think almost like a mashed potato filling. I really enjoyed it. The Kimchi Paella was solid, they nailed the flavors on that. And then the Soft Shell Crab was super tender crab meat (literally soft) that just melts in your mouth, once you get through the crunch of the outer fried shell. Sooo good!! Definitely will come back and try the other stuff on the menu."
1093,"4.75/5Came by with a friend for dinner on a Monday night around 7pm. This place was really popular even though it was a random weekday. Luckily we were able to get a seated spot indoors in under 10 minutes. Service was very friendly and everything was served at a good pace. The dishes here are served tapas style so you will need to order a couple things. Our order of 5 dishes and 2 drinks was the perfect amount for a very filling meal for 2.Our meal included the following:1) Lychee Reach Rich (Soju, Lychee, Mango): Served in a cute little capri-sun style bag. The drink tastes like those little jello fruit snacks and is absolutely delicious. Definitely not a strong drink but tasty.2) Ruby the GF (Soju, Rose, Rosemary Syrup, Grapefruit Juice): My main drink. It tasted like grapefruit mainly but it's still really delicious3) Edamame Dumplings w/ Citrus Truffle Oil: I am obsessed w/ edamame dumplings. I've had a few interpretations but these are up there with my favorites. Smooth silky skin with a creamy but light edamame filling. The citrus truffle oil pairs with the filling's flavor spectacularly and the slight earthy bite from the green pepper is a great contrast. Only downside is it's basically $3 each but it's worth it (5/5)4) Eel Tacos w/ Pickled Slaw, Guacamole, Chipotle Ssamjang Salsa: I wasn't sure how well an eel taco would work but these were spectacular. The eel itself is so tender and just falls apart. The pickled slaw gives just a bit of texture while all the acidic components just sort of marry to combat the eel. I didn't expect to enjoy the guacamole so much. They give you a huge portion of it and by itself it's not extremely flavorful but somehow I kept going back for more. (4.5/5)5) Hand Torn Noodles, Minced Beef, Fennel, Lime Yogurt: Another one of my favorite dishes. Very similar to hand pulled noodles but a bit stubbier. I loved the combination of the chili oil and yogurt. The minced beef reminded me of cumin lamb which also works wonderfully with the yogurt (4.75/5)6) Truffle Mac & Cheese: This tiny pan of mac looks like an art piece. The sauce is a bit looser but still very cheesy and there's threads of cheese mixed directly in it too so you get that lovely cheese pull. I don't know how necessary or helpful the truffle was but it was tasty (4/5)7) Duck Confit Empanadas w/ Creme Fraiche: I'm not the biggest fan of duck confit but it was used well here. It basically tastes like moist shredded duck. Against the dill creme fraiche and the pickles, it's a very vibrant and flavorful dish but just not one that is totally up my alley personally. However my friend was a huge fan. (4/5)Overall, I really loved my visit to Thursday Kitchen. The menu isn't too extensive but there still feels like there's so much more to explore here and I would really love to come back."
1094,"Service: 5/5Food: 3/5Once we entered we were seated quickly inside and was able to sit at the corner of the restaurant. It was pretty busy at the time that we went (Friday, 6pm) and it was quite loud inside. Our waitress came to us and told us that she reccomends that we order at least 2 dishes per person because the dishes are quite small. She also told us that it's best to order eveything at the beginning because if we order again  after eating, it would most likely take about 30 minutes. Since we were not that hungry, we ordered the kimchi paella and the lucky noodle. From the pictures on Yelp, I was super excited to dive into the kimchi paella and have some mussels as well since it's been awhile. Sadly, when the dish came out, there were no mussels. I looked back onto the menu and saw that they must've taken it out from the menu. The kimchi paella was delicious, some areas of the dish however was sour. The rice was moist and the shrimp was a perfect match with the dish. The lucky noodle is very creamy and had a mix of different flavors. There are more vegetables in it then noodles itself and they had celery which I did not think fit well with the dish. The dishes are quite small as the waitress told us and personally for the price you pay, it is not worth it at all. Also, one of the waitresses that was on her first day at the job was constantly refilling our glasses with water. She probably came to our table more than 5 times and I commend her for being super observant and providing great service."
1095,"This place is solid! Between our table of 3, we ordered 6 dishes and were pleasantly surprised. The soju drinks were pretty good and the lights in the drinks look really fun. The lychee mango drink was a little strong. In terms of the food, some dishes were a 9/10 but some were 5/10. The asparagus dish was amazing. The sauce was a combination of tomato, chilli and lime and it was delectable. The lucky noodles were also really good. The sauce was the perfect spice level and the noodles were actually tteokboki cut up. The sauce for the noodles was perfection. Truffle Mac and cheese was bomb. My least favorite dish was the empanadas. The empanadas did not really taste like duck. The meat reminded me of beef actually. All in all, I would come back to Thursday kitchen. Food was mostly amazing and the drinks are fun! It's just really busy sometimes. Make sure your party is all present to get seated!!"
1096,"The drinks in the glowing pouches were really fun. The portion size is a bit small, it is very much a tapa-style sharing with multiple people place to be able to try all the items. All the items were delicious and interesting, but would cost you a pretty penny if you came VERY hungry"
1097,"If you're looking to come in for just good food then there are other places that can deliver for a better value, however I conclude this is a good place for a group of friends planning to have drinks and food.We came here on a Thursday evening assuming it wouldn't be packed, but I was wrong. The wait was an hour but luckily my home was just a few blocks away. I came in with high expectations after countless rave reviews from social media about this place. Their dimly-lit ambiance was a nice touch but I cannot help notice that almost everybody here could be from NYU. I didn't pay any more attention to that and ordered the edamame dumplings, korean popcorn chicken, truffle mac n cheese and steak. We got the edamame dumplings first and it was strange tasting - totally different from what I expected and I didn't know if that was how it was intended to taste. The dumping was also thicker and tougher than it should be for its dumpling size.Then came the truffle mac and cheese which was pretty good...too heavy to be a dish alone, but perfect to complement another dish.After, the korean popcorn chicken was basically typical General Tso Chicken with sweet sauce and was cooked more thoroughly for a more smoky char flavor...I seriously paid $15 for this when I can get this at my local Chinese joint for half the price and double the portion? It was lacking something, so I decided to put a spin to it with the truffle mac and cheese and then it turned out SO BOMB (see picture).Lastly, the steak was definitely the highlight of all the dishes and the feta grits added a nice contrasting touch to it. I really don't get how there are more rave reviews about the General Tso Chicken-wannabe dish than this steak dish. I guess NYU kids prefer takeout-style food.Considering the mediocre food, steep price/size ratio, and long wait times I can say that I will not be coming back here anytime soon knowing I have better options elsewhere with improvements in those three departments. I think I will give this place another chance when I plan to have a group of friends for drinks along with the food.If there is anything to get from this review is that you should order the Korean Popcorn Chicken and Truffle Mac n Cheese and have it both together!"
1098,"Come early if you don't want to wait! Full party must be present but I got here half an hour after open and was able to be seated immediately. We were at the bar and could see them making the soju drinks in batches Capri sun style drinks pouches with LED lights inside were so cool and delicious! Highlights for me were the edamame dumplings and the duck confit empanadas. Edamame filling was very unique in texture with amazing flavor and the empanadas were buttery in the outside and really juicy inside Also enjoyed the steak and the truffle mac, paella was solid and the popcorn chicken was good but not a stand out"
1099,"A must visit!!! One of the best spots in the city.Tips: Get there a few minutes before 6 PM/opening if you don't want to wait. Even when we got there 10 minutes before opening, people were lining up since it's such a popular spot! They also recommend ordering everything at once, since the food is freshly crafted for 20-30 min.Highlights:1) Vibes: fun music, cute outdoor and indoor seating. Ample seating indoors (not pictured).2) Staff: super friendly, super attentive (filled our water any time it was running low). Also helped us out with our order!3) Food: Edamame dumplings are a must - our favorite! We also got the duck empanada (absolutely bursting with flavor) and the kimchi paella (was more of a fishy kimchi fried rice I'd say - perhaps not our top choice). Would definitely recommend paying this spot a visit!"
1100,"Whenever I'm in the city this is my go-to place. There were some new items on the menu that seemed quite enticing.Edamame Dumpling - Like the corn dumpling at Mokyo, the edamame flavor truly sings. I'm not sure how they could make this any better.Ugly Potato - They came out a bit dry but if it's potato I will eat it. It definitely needed more sauce/more feta.Soft Shell Crab - My only gripe about it was that the breading was a bit too heavy and weighed it all down bite-wise. Even more acid would be welcome.Truffle Mac & Cheese - I'm glad that this was still on the menu. I could eat bowls and bowls of this stuff.Steak - Another classic that I hope never leaves. The steak is cooked to perfection. And with the grits and the veg it's This time around I tried the Yuzu Tonic and Golden Punch. I was more of a fan of the Golden Punch but when I curiously tried them together my mind was blown. You're welcome."
1101,"Thursday kitchen offers Korean food with French and Spanish influences tapas style. The food was amazing and loaded with flavors. The edamame dumpling, kimchi paella, lucky noodles and steak were delicious and definitely a must order. We finished our meal with the popcorn ice cream which had a salty caramel flavor and packed with crunch. Would definitely recommend this place for your next date night or a dinner with friends with a hot sake for a winter night out in the city!"
1102,Five stars literally because of the Mac and cheese!! It is amazing the truffle flavor is light and it is so gooey and delicious. Keep coming back for more. Definitely worth the whole visit. The drinks are okay in my opinion more for the aesthetic. Good service and a nice vibe at this restaurant!
1103,"I had come to Thursday Kitchen pre covid for a quick appetizer and drinks, really liked it then. Returned recently with a friend around 6:30pm on a Saturday, we were told that it's about a 50 min wait. On point, we got a text in about 45 mins saying our table was ready. The Soju cocktails are amazing - we tried the lychee/mango, blue and grapefruit. I think the grapefruit one is the best.Dinner in order of preference shared between the two of us  - Korean Fried chicken, Soft Shell Crab, Chilaquiles, Mac & Cheese, Ugly Potato and Edamame dumpling. The portions are small, so though we ordered 6 dishes between us and had a couple rounds of drinks, we walked out comfortably full. Oh also, the bread pudding is amazing!! Do it! The service is excellent, the servers are super friendly and want you to have a good time. I'd come back here any day of the week!"
1104,"THURSDAY KITCHEN! This is a great spot for after work drinks, a date night, a dinner with the family - everything. Thursday Kitchen has Korean-inspired fusion tapas and small plates, and everything we ordered was a hit.We started with the Capri cocktails, which are served in a reusable Capri Sun container with a little light, super cute. We then ordered most of the menu for the four of us - edamame dumplings, ugly potato, chilaquiles, kimchi paella, lucky noodle, gnocchi, korean popcorn chicken, and duck confit empanada. It definitely felt like the perfect amount of food.My favorites were definitely the lucky noodle and the gnocchi - but everything was so well prepared and thought out. The sauces paired with those dishes were out of this world. The food apparently rotates seasonally, but has a few best selling dishes that stay on the menu. I don't think you can go wrong with anything here. This place has such great reviews for a reason!"
1105,"Be sure to get here early! This place is popping and gets crowded very quickly. Loved the presentation of the drinks! We got the packaged soju and loved how they lit up. We ordered the popcorn chicken, tuna, truffle Mac and cheese, and lucky noodles. Wouldn't say it was ""out of this world"" good but it was enough! Also a bit expensive Overall not bad, but I don't think I'll be coming back"
1106,"Stopped here at 6:30 for dinner - no wait for outside. Got the Cutetini and the grapefruit cocktails (I forget the name of the grapefruit one). Good but not that strong in alcohol taste but very strong in cucumber & grapefruit. The ambience:- While this restaurant had great ambiance from what it seemed inside, the outside ambiance was dampened as it felt like a fraternity party with Travis Scott blaring in the background. Kind of distracting for conversation.  Not sure what music was inside but maybe play something a bit less lyrical?The food: - We got the edamame dumplings, popcorn chicken, lucky noodles, kimchi rice and empanadas for us 3. It was plenty of food and we didn't leave starving or too full.- The edamame dumplings were probably one of the most unique I've had in a while. The inside was creamy and balanced with both edamame flavor and cheese. I didn't taste much truffle oil but the micro greens on top were very flavorful!- The seafood kimchi paella was good but not heavy in kimchi flavor which was disappointing nor crispy like paella should be. Not my favorite. - The popcorn chicken was tasty and tangy with a sweet and spicy glaze on top. It also maintained its crispiness very well. However, it wasn't necessarily unique.- The lucky noodles were the most impressive. The fennel was such a contrasting, refreshing crunch against the spicy sauce and thick noodle. The yogurt added a creamy brightness and the beef was flavorful. I would recommend this dish the most! - The duck confit empanadas were the most disappointing. The crust of the empanada felt a bit too thick, and the duck tasted a bit like pork. There was also a pickle on top (??) and it was served with dill sauce. The dill cream sauce helped elevate the bread and added more flavor, but I just felt like this dish could've been skipped.Overall: 8/10. I loved the food, not super sure why it's THIS hyped considering 2 out of our 5 dishes (paella and empanadas) were just OK to me. The music was also a big turn off, honestly. But glad we got to try!"
1107,"Truly a gem of a restaurant with Korean tapas and capri-sun soju cocktail pouches! Eating here is a fun treat. Dishes here are small plates with a Korean spin. DRINKS: super cute and fun soju based drinks that are served in a plastic capri-sun like bag that glows in the dark. Alcoholic adult juice pouches. All of the flavors are fruity and pretty good, not to mention strong! One is enough to get me feeling ~funny~ lol. I like the Strawberry Yuzu :-) FOOD: small plates with fusion dishes like gnocchi with gochujang, kimchi paella, etc. but the MUST try and best dish here is their EDAMAME DUMPLINGS!!! Insanely good. Creamy edamame filling that melts in your mouth. This is my favorite thing here and one of their most infamous menu offerings for good reason.We also tried their gnocchi and peach salad and they were just good, nothing too special. Although I adored their edamame dumplings and think their drinks are fun, I have to give 4/5 instead of 5 stars because of how pricey everything is for the size, as well as the fact that they do not accommodate modification requests for food intolerances / allergies / dietary sensitivity. Most of the dishes here have cheese or cream and they will not take out ingredients or prepare them differently if you ask. It's worth noting that these really are small plates, in the sense that the portions are tiny. Dishes are meant to be shared but it would probably take a good handful of items in order to get full if you are with a bigger group of people. Each dish is around $15 so it really adds up. I would recommend going elsewhere if you want an actual filling dinner and do not want to pay a lot of money on small dishes. Otherwise, this would be a good spot to come for drinks and snacks.Really busy place and gets so crowded at night, so make sure to come earlier to get on the waitlist if you can or be prepared to wait. Tip: Check out their sister restaurant MOKYO, which I prefer due to the enhanced variety of dishes and their makgeolli (rice wine) monitor that Thursday Kitchen doesn't serve!"
1108,"This is a really unique korean fusion tapa restaurant in the east village. My friend's favorite is the truffle mac and cheese (strong smell of truffles), and mine was the soft shell crab! We were also curious about the pasta dishes like the gnocchi and paella, but they're cooked in nonconventional ways, so don't expect the usual. When I go back, I think I'll try something else since there are lots of options to choose from.Lasrly, the environment is loud and not easy to talk over, but has a cozy and fun vibe."
1109,"So glad we could make it to this place! Arrived a few minutes before opening at 6 PM (on a Thursday lol). We asked to be seated inside, which I would recommend, for the atmosphere. Our server was detail oriented in her explanation of the restaurant's concept and made us feel comfortable. We decided to share a few dishes. The plantain comes with very spicy creamy sauce / goat cheese. I was not able to taste the goat cheese as much due to the spice. The kimchi paella was my favorite dish as it came with a good portion of seafood and addictive rice. And we got the capri suns ($8), which are a signature drink they offer. One was yuzu strawberry flavored and the other had pineapple juice plus lychee. They have more alcoholic options as well. It was easy to see why this place is popular. Whether it's date night or just good vibes, try it out!"
1110,"Walking into Thursday Kitchen, you're met with a very lively ambiance. It is a pretty loud but fun environment with dim lighting. Even for a Tuesday, it was surprisingly crowded, and we had to wait about fifteen minutes before being seated. Although it seemed like a busy night, the service was great and very attentive to our needs. I can with two other people and we ordered five dishes for the table. This restaurant serves tapas-style Korean-fusion food, so it is definitely a place to go if you like sharing. We ordered the Edamame Dumplings, Gnocchi, Korean Popcorn Chicken, Asparagus, and Tuna Crudo. Everything we got was delicious, but to me, the real stand out dishes were the asparagus and Korean popcorn chicken. The one dish I think I would probably not recommend is the Tuna Crudo. Nothing was bad about it, I just think there are better things on the menu that are more interest and more worth your money.The one con about the restaurant was I felt that the portion sizes were small for the price. While the prices were not extremely outrageous, it was more expensive than I expected, and I didn't leave completely stuffed. I wasn't upset with the prices that I paid as I did genuinely enjoy the dishes we ordered, but I did feel like it was worth noting. I would recommend trying this place out, and I would come back!"
1111,"I wish I could give 4.5... okay, so I tried this place via delivery because I had just gotten a tattoo and I needed to go back to my hotel. Then... I was so hungry I forgot to take pictures I got three foods, two drinks. My boyfriend and I shared. This was a funny experience for us because we could barely agree.Korean popcorn chicken: This was so good! The sauce was super yummy and just enough sticky, not messy though. The chicken was moist and not try, and really tender. But my boyfriend found it edible, but kind of whatever. Kimchi paella: I thought it was way too sour. My boyfriend went and squeezed the two lemon slices on the top. It was a good texture, but I could only feel the cheese not taste it. The only thing I could taste was sour. My boyfriend on the other hand thought it was really, really good!! He loved the kimchi paella.Bread pudding: We both loved this!! This was so good!! It had blueberry in it which was the best thing to ever happen to bread pudding. Drinks (non-alcoholic): Yuzu tonic and Golden punch. They came in cute pouches, so excited. They were both really good, but my boyfriend and I had clear favorites. I could not get enough of the Yuzu tonic, but he strongly preferred the Golden punch."
1112,"Was very impressed about my dinner here and have to say I think it's worth the hype. I recommend getting there a little before it opens to wait on line as they don't accept reservations (We got there at 5:45 for a 6pm opening and were seated right away). By the time we left, there seemed to be a long line and wait.Although the restaurant was crowded, the service was still excellent. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. We had the edamame dumplings (must get), korean popcorn chicken, gnoochi (a little spicey, my least favorite dish if I had to pick), and the chilequiles. This was enough food for 2 people. I wish we tried the truffle mac and cheese as it smelled delicious. The drinks are served in light up pouches and they play ""trendy"" music which makes for a fun environment. Highly recommend!"
1113,"One of the best restaurants I've been to in NYC and I loved the creativity of all the dishes. We shared 6 dishes among 4 people and left feeling still a little hungry, but it was fine given we had other food plans for the night. Come early and be prepared to wait, we took a walk to a nearby park as we waited for a table.Soft Shell Crab Katsu - Solid, the crispiness of the fried crab outside with the meat of the inside. Paired with some cubed pears.Duck Empanadas - Loved dipping the dumplings in the sauce they provided. Did not have a strong duck taste, but yummy nonetheless.Steak - Beautifully cooked juicy steak, probably some of the best I have had. This one did feel like an entree for one person with the grits and side salad.Kimchi Paella - My least favorite, the paella did not have much taste and I would've liked some stronger seasoning.Popcorn Chicken - Reminded me of orange chicken. Good, but you're better off ordering something more special off their menu.Lucky Noodle - My favorite! The softness of the noodles and the flavor from the beef and spices paired beautifully. I almost wish I had just ordered a full bowl of this."
1114,"This spot is just as good as the sister restaurant, Mokyo!They have the same really fun cocktails as Mokyo, which are served in a bag and are soju based. My favorite is the mango lychee but they're all really good! The food is interesting but familiar. I can't say I've had a dish that I've disliked here. Some of my favorites are the soft shell crab, gnocchi, edamame dumpling (so creamy it almost reminds me of mashed potatoes), and the seafood kimchi paella. It does get crowded here so be prepared to wait a few minutes or try to eat on the earlier side. You can't make a reservation, but you can at Mokyo if you're someone who likes to have one."
1115,"I love this place! It was a recommendation from a friend   I got there right before it opened on a weekday and it packed up quickly. It's dim lighting throughout. They play music at a level you can hear the song and also hear yourself talking. Our waitress was very sweet, attentive and kind. They don't take reservations so keep that in mind we got lucky and we're seated right away because we got there 15 mins before opening but it's worth it! The food and the drinks were so good. I will definitely be returning."
1116,"This is a tapa-styled restaurant so it's perfect for those who like to try new things. We ordered the adult caprisuns to start and they made us really nostalgic. For food, we ordered the truffle Mac and cheese, kimchi paella, and Korean popcorn chicken. We throughly enjoyed all three items and felt pretty satisfied after. Portion sizes are quite small but 3 dishes were enough for the two of us."
1117,"We had a reservation for 8 people and waited 1.5 hours to be seated. When we finally got seated they told us our table was for 6 which was completely off. As We sat down and tried to make the seating work, the waiter said there was no way he could seat all 8 of us. Such a disappointment to wait that long for such a well known place and be told they couldn't accommodate us after waiting for the table we reserved !!!! Disappointed.Dumplings were so so. Service was HORRID. Would not come back. Maybe learn how to accommodate guests who already made a reservation before seating them and then saying they don't have enough room."
1118,"Thursday Kitchen, in the East Village is the sister restaraunt to Mokyo and features small plate Korean dishes blended with Spanish and French influences. The menu is split between veggies, seafood, meat, and starches and we recommend trying dishes from each category to enjoy the versatility of the menu. The truffle Mac and cheese and the edamame dumplings are simply to die for. We also enjoyed the steak and duck empanadas. Be sure to order one of their soju cocktails served in Capri-Sun style pouches with glowing LED cubes cubes. The popcorn ice cream makes for a sweet and savory end to a satisfying meal. instagram.com/p/CXPfRhbt…"
1119,"Be warned: Do not come at 7pm and expect to be seated quickly. The wait on a weekend can be longer than 2 hours. That's because Thursday Kitchen is only open for dinner, does not take reservations, and actually lives up to the hype (IMHO).My friend and I got here at 6pm (right when they opened) on a rainy Tuesday and were seated right away. Even then, there were about five parties waiting to be seated. What we ordered:-- Edamame Dumplings-- Kimchi Paella-- Lucky Noodle-- Truffle Mac & Cheese-- Duck Confit EmpanadaThe standouts were the dumplings, the noodles, and the mac & cheese, although everything was outstanding. The food is cooked in the French style so do expect cheese and butter in these dishes (for those who are lactose intolerant). Each dish is beautifully prepared and presented, and every bite was delicious, but also very rich. Luckily, the portions are tapas-size so you can safely get a bunch of things to share.They have a number of soju cocktails which are served Capri Sun-style with LED ice cubes so they glow neon colors. Very fun. I got Ruby the GF which was yummy and not too sweet."
1120,"We came on a Monday evening right when it opened. No wait and several tables remained available during the duration our dinner.Server suggested two dishes per person but we had more than that. The edamame dumplings were a standout. We've never had anything quite like it and they were cooked well. The batter that the soft shell crab was cooked in leaned sweet. It reminded me almost of the sweetness of funnel cake, which I personally enjoy. I just missed the actual flavor of the crab because all I could taste was the sweet batter. Kimchi paella was solid. My husband wasn't a huge fan of the lucky noodle dish but I enjoyed the chewiness of the torn noodles with the crispness of the vegetables. I can't handle a lot of spice and could easily eat both the kimchi paella and lucky noodles. Eel tacos were also made well, no complaints. Truffle mac and cheese was tasty. Steak was very flavorful and soft.I enjoyed trying yuzu beer for the first time as well. Worth checking out if the menu piques your interest. No high chairs were offered and there's no changing table in the restroom."
1121,Food was delicious and portions were small so order more!The steak was cooked to perfection!Mac n cheese had great flavor!Would come back for sureCon: very loud and crowded NOT coo is cautious at all!
1122,"Almost like a club-vibe to get in. Kind of funny how serious they are about timing. My friend and I - both Korean - thought the food was okay. Maybe because we didn't order animals? Maybe if you eat animals, order animals. The truffle mac and cheese was full of cream. The asparagus was good, still a little woody at the bottoms. The edamame dumplings - yummy, gone in two bites - tasted more of truffle oil than the mac and cheese. The tomatoes - maybe because I have West-coast standards - were a bit under-ripe, though colorful. I think come here if you want pretty soju LED drinks?"
1123,"The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the extremely long wait time because there's no reservation system- but the food is amazing! There are so many reviews for this restaurant and the hype is understandable. We came at 7pm on a Friday, where the wait was 2.5 hours for 4 people. Luckily, our friends lived nearby so we killed the time at their place. When finally seated, every dish that was brought on was astonishing. The only thing is I wish the portions were bigger! At first look, the pricing looks quite decent but the dishes, since it's tapas style, are quite small especially when shared. I'd recommend coming here with a small party. The standout was the truffle Mac and cheese and eel taco personally. Just the perfect amount of truffle drizzled on the creamy Mac and cheese leaves you wanting so much more! The eel taco is quite unique, and the guac adds a light twist to what might be a heavy bite. Be prepared to wait if you come, but also be prepared to have an unforgettable meal."
1124,"We came here on a Friday after waiting at Catch almost 1 hours 15 minutes past reservation time.  It was suggested to us by a local and it was excellent!  We had the kimchi paella, soft shell crab, asparagus, Korean popcorn chicken, truffle Mac and cheese and bread pudding.  I had the pure strawberry and my guest had the blah blah blue.  It was all to die for and our server you could tell really cared about our experience even though we walked in on short notice.  Will definitely go back again when in the area!"
1125,Omg!! What a great meal from start to finish. I have been dying to try Thursday kitchen for the longest time. We came on a Sunday evening and were able to be seated immediately (IMO the best spot for outdoor dining). We decided to share as many dishes as we could and left feeling full and satisfied. We ordered: Edamame dumplings 8/10- overall flavor was delicious but texture a little mushy for my taste Steak 7/10- steak was a little tough but the flavors were excellent Truffle mac and cheese 10/10 *MUST ORDER* - everything you could ever want. That cheese pull though Kimchi paella 9/10 *MUST ORDER* - amazing mix of flavors and perfectly cooked seafood Gnocchi 6/10 - gnocchi had amazing texture but the sauce was a little too sweetDefinitely recommend checking Thursday Kitchen out for small but filling bites! Great place for catching up with friends or date night!
1126,"second time is the charm! we tried eating at thursday kitchen but it was packed the other time. This time we went at 7 and had a 50 min wait time. This was worth the wait!!!Truffle mac and cheese: pretty heavy, it's good that the serving size is not too big. It's very creamy and deliciousKimchi Paella: 10/10 my favorite of the night. It's not too sour if you don't squeeze the lemons, the kimchi itself is already sour. And the cheese was pretty distinct in the dish. the shrimp was also packed with flavor dishes are smallish but my bf and I felt full (we ate a light snack before hand)"
1127,"The edamame dumplings were the highlight!!! I recommend getting at least one order of these. The truffle Mac and cheese was also very good and more filling than some of the other small plates. We also got an order of the kimchi paella, salmon tartare tacos, Korean popcorn chicken, and steak. Everything was so good! The drinks are listed from least sugary to most sugary but we found that they were all pretty sweet! I recommend trying one pouch since they are such a staple of Thursday Kitchen."
1128,"A gem of a restaurant that offers a fusion of Korean, French, and Spanish cuisines in tapas style fashion. Thursday Kitchen does not take reservations, so be here during non-peak hours or be ready to wait.Drinks -A big selling point for this restaurant is their unique drinks served in a ""capri-sun"" styled pouch. I got the Blah Blah Blue and it packed a punch. It was a mix of soju, blue curacao, pineapple, and lime juice. They definitely did not skimp out on the soju because it packed a punch. The pouches also include a set of LED ice cubes, which causes your pouch to light up. Neat feature! There is also a wide selection of reds, whites, beers, and an assortment of Asian spirits.  Food - Kimchi Paella - You can't go wrong with a paella if you are having tapas. The texture of the paella reminds me your traditional risotto. It also includes white tiger shrimp, saffron, and caramelized kimchi. A perfect blend of flavors. Truffle Mac and Cheese - For some reason, I expected this to be more cheesy? Not sure, but it made the cut. There were hints of broccoli, truffle, and micro basil. Korean Popcorn Chicken - Nothing crazy here, but who doesn't love some crispy fried sweet and spicy popcorn chicken? Safe choice, but it does not make it any less delicious. Steak - Get the steak! It only comes in medium-rare, but who cares! It came with a soy-garlic glaze, feta grits, and a side of veggies. This was the highlight of the meal!!The server was attentive and made sure the table was well accommodated during this experience. It can get pretty loud here, so make sure you use your outside voice! I would definitely plan to revisit this location in the future."
1129,Truffle Mac and Cheese - amazing. One of the top dishes in the city hands down. It's apparently the most popular dish here.
1130,"I had high expectations for Thursday Kitchen, so I'm sad to report back that my experience there was pretty average. My friend and I went on a Sunday evening around 6 pm and they had open tables both indoors and outdoors with no wait which was nice. Our waiter recommended 1-2 dishes per person since the portions are tapa size. Food: We ordered the kimchi paella, truffle Mac n cheese, Korean popcorn chicken, and duck confit empanadas. Our waiter seemed a bit surprised when we ordered 4 dishes since she said this will be a lot of food. When our food came out, I was expecting there to be more food since the two of us finished everything and still had room to eat (we were content though). If I had to rank in order starting with most favorite, my list would be truffle Mac n cheese, popcorn chicken, kimchi paella, and duck empanadas. The truffle Mac n cheese was super cheesy and had a strong truffle flavor which was yummy. Other than the mac n cheese, I felt like the other dishes were average. The popcorn chicken had a sweet sauce coating the chicken and was still crispy. The kimchi paella didn't have too strong of a kimchi flavor which I appreciated since I'm not the biggest fan of kimchi. The duck empanadas were pretty underwhelming, the outside seemed a bit dry and there wasn't a lot of duck flavor coming through. We ended up paying about $40 per person after tip. Service: Service was great! People consistently filled our water cups and the food came out quickly. I've heard a lot of good reviews about this place so I came in with high expectations, but I felt like each dish didn't have anything particularly exciting or special."
1131,"Delicious food and fantastic, quick service. We waited 45 minutes on a Thursday evening - apropos.  We had the edamame  dumplings which were a fantastic start. Followed by Korean popcorn chicken with just enough sweet. The truffle Mac and cheese was great - not too strong of a truffle flavor. Also shared the soft shell crab which was the highlight! Ordered the steak as well but wasn't needed. Too many dishes for two people. But the dishes were all to die for. So glad we were able to snag a a spot after a short wait period."
1132,"I LOVED this spot and would argue it's one of the best Korean fusion tapas I've had! We tried the edamame dumplings, steak, truffle mac & cheese, popcorn chicken, and cauliflower (in order of my favorites). They were all soo good but the edamame dumplings & steak stole the show! * Edamame dumplings- filled with a smooth & creamy edamame paste and topped with the perfect amount of truffle oil & Parmesan. So unique and delicious! My only complaint is I wish this plate came with more! We shared amongst 3 and got ~1 each* Steak- tender and cooked to perfection. Topped with a soy garlic glaze and coupled with grits-like feta cheese. Absolutely amazing * Truffle Mac & cheese - I loved that you can smell the truffle the minute they bring it by your table, they don't skimp on the truffle! This was delicious and creamy! (but definitely on the heavier side)* Korean popcorn chicken - pretty good and would have again (I love popcorn chicken), but nothing too special!* Cauliflower - spiced and seasoned, almost close to an Indian food-like flavoring. Good, but not amazing Overall, loved the food here! You can't go wrong with your choices. As our drink, we got the saki but I absolutely want to try the soju next time :)Also- great covid protocols. They took temps and our table was separated by curtains on each side (we sat inside). I recommend going early since they don't take reservations and there's always a wait!"
1133,"I would give this place 6 stars if possible! My boyfriend and I came yesterday (on a Sunday night) and we had to wait ~30 minutes even though it was around 9PM-- definitely proof of how busy this place is. Everything about this place is exquisite: the food, the drinks, and the waitstaff. I really wish I knew my waiters first name to call him out in this review, because he REALLY elevated our experience. He mentioned he also works at Mokyo and has been working in the food industry for a while. He was awesome about explaining the restaurant's concept + menu to us and recommended the Edamame dumpling, Kimchi Paella, and Steak. We took all of his recommendations and also ordered the Soft Shell Crab, Yuzu Beer, and the Grapefruit Soju cocktail. Every single dish was absolutely incredible and our waiter did a beautiful job of describing what we were eating. He was super attentive to our table + our entire section. Truly props to this man for being one of the highlights of our culinary experience! I've been to numerous restaurants in NYC and I have to say, Thursday Kitchen is hands down one of my favorite spots. If I had to say which tapas was my favorite, I would definitely  say the Steak."
1134,"Everything is overpriced for the portion. I understand that these are tapas, and the intent is for you to enjoy a flavorful experience independent of quantity. However, I found the flavors to be slightly underwhelming given the plethora of hyped up reviews that I'd read prior to coming. Perhaps this is just a classic case of expectation not meeting reality, but the overall experience was pleasant with good food, quick service, and amicable staff."
1135,"Just awesome place, I really liked the dishes, the price is also reasonable, the service is good, based on all of the above - 5 stars"
1136,Best fusion restaurant in EV!The portions are small but you can try most of the menu and share which is great. Everything is amazing and flavorful (especially paired with the soju drink) and it feels like you're taste testing. Their bread pudding dessert is 10/10 would go again for  that. Service is amazing too but you have to order all the food at once and there's a 90min table limit.
1137,"Fantastic tapas! Love the small Asian inspired bites. Cocktails were super fun and had a nice twist that made it Asian influenced. Would highly recommend edamame dumplings, soft shell crab, and their tuna. All soju/mixed drinks are a win from us"
1138,"This is such a lovely little restaurant. It is very moderately priced for the experience and food that you get. Our waiter was phenomenal, I wish I remembered his name. The inside of the restaurant was very cozy. We started off with the capri-sun type cocktails. All of them were a bit too sweet for my liking, but fun nonetheless because the bags light up! Then, the food started coming. The must-gets: edamame dumplings, truffle mac and cheese, tuna crudo. The goods but not my favorites: popcorn chicken, soft shell crab. I'm telling you, please don't leave without ordering those must-gets. I will definitely be returning."
1139,"11/9/21 Visit after Pandemic 2020...Thursday kitchen is one of my favorite restaurant's..  For a vegetarian meal, we had the Truffle mac, Edamame dumplings, Plaintains, & Ugly PotatoTwo things I miss from the menu are Cauliflower & Sweet potato which I hope they bring back soonThe ugly potato could've been better from our meal..  The truffle mac & Edamame dumplings are some of the best especially for truffle loversGood options for both Non Vegetarians & Vegetarians.As a group, Order a bunch of tapas/ drinks & have a great time!"
1140,"This is the definition of a hidden gem. On the outside, I would have never guessed that this restaurant tasted so amazing. The ambiance is intimate, with music playing in the background. The artwork and decor give an authentic vibe. I love Indian food, and this is the first time I have been left speechless. The flavors are out of this world. Highly recommend. I had the pakora and the Saang Peener."
1141,"I ordered the Chicken Makhni (butter chicken) at ""regular spicy"" (spice level 4/10), which was good spice level for me. The chicken did feel a little overcooked, but the overall dish was definitely delicious.I took off one star because of the unexpectedly small amount of rice. I ordered garlic naan to share with a friend, and that provided me with the right amount of carbs to eat with the dish I ordered."
1142,"Good food and excellent service.I came here in a group of four friends for dinner. I ordered the $25 pre fix meal with the vegetable samosa as an appetizer, Malai Kofta for the entree and Kheer for the dessert.The vegetable samosa was my favorite. It was the largest samosa I have ever seen, the filling was delicious and perfectly seasoned. The Malai Kofta is a vegetable croquette, but it wasn't what I expected-I thought it tasted good, but I didn't taste or see any vegetables. It did have a strong coconut flavor that stood out as well. The dessert was a cashew rice pudding that had a very mild flavor. It was also good, but I don't think I would order it again. I was also able to try the Lamb Vindaloo. That dish tasted so amazing-It was spicy but I really loved the flavors and I would order that dish again.Also, the service here was great. They were nice, attentive and always came around to fill the water glasses. It is a smaller dining area, but they create a nice cozy ambiance. Overall, this was a great option for Indian food in the area."
1143,"Best Indian food in NYC! We've tried a few different Indian spots in NYC and all of them were pretty lackluster, but Bengal Tiger was easily the best. The restaurant can be a bit hard to find as it's on the 2nd floor. The decor and music transported us to a hidden oasis in the bustle of Manhattan. We were pretty hungry, so we shared the Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Curry, and Samosa. The portions were bigger than we expected! Tasted so authentic and delicious. We ordered spice level 5 and it was pretty spicy, so glad they didn't skimp on the spice there. Service was really great as well!"
1144,"If you love Indian food and great bargains, then a visit to Bengal Tiger Indian Food is a must. For $25, their three-course prix fixe menu offers a plethora of options. A girlfriend and I ate here and our plates couldn't be any more different.The prix fixe menu offers an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert. I chose a vegetable samosa, the chicken tikka masala, and a gulab jamun. She had the keema samosa, which is essentially a minced lamb and pea turnover, as well as the lamb korma (at least I think it was that), and the rasmalai, which is just cheese upon cheese.Before ordering from the menu, though, we started our evening with a pair of mango lassis, and meh, while refreshing, these seemed like more yogurt than actual mango. It felt as if rather than drinking these lassis, we should've eaten them instead. Oh well.The actual food was tasty. We both enjoyed our meals and even had enough for leftovers. I will say though that some choices are subject to personal state. I have a less adventurous palette than my girlfriend, so I wasn't a particular fan of her dishes, but that's because I generally detest lamb. I can only think of one place where I can eat it and it's only one specific cut of lamb.That being said, if you're anything like me, stick to more common dishes. The vegetable samosa was hearty and warm, the chicken tikka masala was creamy and fragrant, and the gulab jamun... well... I got it because it was part of the special, but really, if you're not much into ethnic desserts, you may not like this. Me personally? I found it a bit too sweet and the rosewater it was in just made me feel like it was awkward and gooey. Just not my thing.Our waiter was very nice and efficient. Note that at this restaurant, you'll be checked to see if you've been vaccinated. You know - the standard of the NYC scene now. That, and well, be aware that they're located on the second floor of the building."
1145,"The high Yelp ratings brought us into this establishment. But, frankly, I am very surprised that Bengal Tiger receives such high marks. The food was fine, but it did not live up to the expectations set by all the reviews. We ordered the chicken makhani, saag paneer, and garlic naan.  The chicken makhani was good. It was rich and very creamy, but flavorful. The saag paneer, however, was not truly saag. The restaurant has their own spin on what this entrée should be. I was expecting traditional North Indian saag paneer, which is well blended and homogeneous.  It did not live up to that. The interior does have very nice ambience with the lovely art decor and lighting."
1146,"What a great lunch deal ($16 for appetizer and entree). I eat Indian food alottt and let me tell you that this place has outstanding paneer! It's texture is unlike most others I've had. It's softer snd not rubbery if that makes sense. So good! The sauces here are amazing as well! I got to try the makhni and the tikka masala, both were equally delicious and the spice level was just right. The samosa was also yummy!"
1147,"I got this for take out and it was really yummy! It was a big portion, so I ate this as part of two meals. The chicken tikka masala had big chunks of tender chicken and the sauce was seasoned well. I got it with a side of garlic naan which was delicious with the generous amount of garlic and butter on top. Would definitely get this again!"
1148,"Meat samosas were tasty, seasoned well with a jammy spicy sauce but just warmed, barely.The pakoras were a bit dry and lacked textural interest- ""it's like an Indian hush puppy"" with same sauce. Was ok.The lamb vindaloo was spicy and full of flavor. For the spicy eater- it's the minimal spicy you'd want. For the non-spicy eater- it packs a punch. Relative. The chicken tikka was well balanced albeit a bit chunky and dry- and sauce really becomes bland next to the much heavier punchier sauces we'd order.The saag paneer was really well done. Cheese like tofu adds textual interest to the silky well balanced spinach slurry. The lamb biriyani while generous in meat was a bit gummy and wet- like a ""dry"" stew w a spicy kick when im used to fluffier airier actual dry biryani. Not bad but not what I was expecting. Mango lassis were smooth Uber yogurty. The garlic naan was excellent when eaten immediately. Soft super pungent garlicky, hot and pillowy. Goes better than rice with all the saucy entrees. Well almost. Depends how much you love rice."
1149,"I went to Bengal Tiger Indian Food in desperate need of a good Indian dining experience. I haven't found any great spots near me in Atlanta. If there's one thing NYC can do, it is deliver on amazing food. Bengal Tiger far exceeded my already high expectations.I went around 1:00p on a weekday and didn't have trouble finding a table. As other diners have remarked, it's a small restaurant and you probably should make reservations to be safe. Bengal Tiger has a small menu, which is absolutely perfect. You want a focused kitchen that can execute on its core competencies with fresh ingredients.There is a $16 lunch special available during their lunch hours: soup/pakora and an entree. I ordered the pakora and a lamb vindaloo (+$1 surcharge). Entrees have a side of basmati rice included in the price. The server warned me multiple times that their vindaloo is incredibly spicy. I slightly dismissed this as simple pish posh. It wasn't.The pakora arrived first, and I was delighted. It was huge, very crispy, and served with a perfect sauce.Shortly afterwards, the lamb vindaloo arrived with a side of basmati rice. The serving bowl is smaller, but I didn't feel cheated. It was full of meat and potatoes. I would've liked the portion of rice to be bigger, but I was offered more rice at no additional charge.The flavor of the vindaloo was truly incomparable. I tasted all of the elements that I search for in a perfect vindaloo. The heat of the vindaloo was the only thing that matched its incredible flavors. Fellow spicy food junkies should take heed: this is a very spicy vindaloo. Service matched the incredibly high quality of food. My water glass never even sat half empty. My primary server was terrific, and the rest of the staff was equally attentive. When I started struggling to finish my meal, one of the servers offered to bring me out a side of yogurt or to swap out the entree for a different one. I'm no bih so I finished my meal, but I was incredibly appreciative of the generous offer.I had the best vindaloo that I've ever tasted at Bengal Tiger Indian Food. The service is incredible, and the price is somehow equal to Indian spots in Atlanta. I will happily return."
1150,"Holy moly. Get the coconut naan. Get two orders of the coconut naan. I'm going to dream about it. Seriously this place was awesome. Service was 12/10, food was incredible, we got the butter chicken and the saag paneer. We ended with a mango lassi."
1151,"This is highly recommended by many friends. finally here to experience it.was a good, was it bad?I knew it had to be good, with so many great reviews, and so many of my friends who have eaten here.Was any part of it disappointing?No... It was better than I expected.Every drop was unbelievable. I almost wish they gave me more rice just so I could soak up the sauce.Sad thing is, they are so busy, it's hard to get in there. So, when it's freezing cold and miserable outside.... GO HERE TO EAT!  Spend $300, get a plane ticket, crawl on your hands and knees and up the stairs to get into this place to feed. If it's the last meal you ever have, bring your executioner. There's a good chance he will buy you seconds.look on yelp, see what's the most popular, buy it, eat it. And then send me a compliment. Why? Because from one fat guy to another... I admire this restaurant. And I deserve a little credit for that. Lol... burp..."
1152,"One of my favourite spots - been coming here for years (since HS lol).Being born and raised in Singapore, I appreciate that their dishes are actually spicy. You can tell them your spice tolerance on a scale of 1-10.Recently came with a friend and got Paneer Makhani. So creamy. So spicy. So much flavor. I nearly cried. Always get garlic naan- you will never regret.Also, the spot is a bit sus with the stairs, but it's very cute once you get inside and the service is great. Would recommend for a more casual date night."
1153,"We came here for the 3 course prix fix meal 5:55pm Thursday.Had to wait for a corner table for two, which was being vacated by a couple, with the guy taking an extended stay in the bathroom.  Unusual, it almost always the lady taking the bathroom break.The butternut squash soup was decent, no adventures into the unknown, thick and hearty, but no vegetables floating.My keema samosa was packed with ground up lamb, with a few peas mixed in, inside a fried dough -too hot to handle right out of the oven.Wife was going to order Vindaloo chicken, but the waiter sized her up, a senior white lady, and said that it way too spicy for her, so she picked chicken tikka marsala.The tikka marsala was exceptionally tender and fresh, easily cuttable with a fork in a rich creamy tomato based gravy.  About 4 large chunks of white chicken breast immersed in the delicious gravy.The lamb curry was also very tender, and delicious, probably a little bit less meat than the chicken dish, and more gravy, on the spicy side.  One of the best lamb dishes I've tasted, with chunks of lamb meat, not minced lamb, and not ground up lamb.    No cutting corners on quality.Not enough basmati rice to go with the meats.  Had to order garlic naan.  The kheer was tasteless for dessert, tasting like oatmeal.  The Gulab Jamun was exceptionally sweet with the taste of honey, and added some to the kheer to give it some taste.Got out at 7:10pm,and the only tables available were a few two seaters.Don't like stairs?  Then this place is not for you, as 18 stairs straight up from street level, with no landing in between.     Did a yelp check in, and unlike others, no complimentary naan for us!"
1154,"So happy to have Yelped our way to this gem. Not much to look at, but the food is fantastic and the service great. I was with a party of five, so we ordered a variety of food items to share. All were delicious with nicely flavored sauces. The Malai Kofta was a favorite. The seating is a bit limited but worth the wait. Looking forward to our next visit"
1155,Omg the food here is BOMB. The curry chicken was the perfect amount of spice because we chose mild and the tikka masala was creamy and delicious. The garlic naan was fluffy and seasoned perfectly. It was great to dip into the sauces and the basmati rice was fluffy and fresh. I loved everything here. The lunch special on weekdays is very worth it!
1156,The paneer makhani was exceptional. Amazing flavor. A tiny spicy. The saag paneer was okay. Wouldn't get it again. The mango lassi came in a weird container but was good. The naan was delicious. I loved the rice. Some of the best Indian take out I've had. A little pricey.
1157,"Favorite Indian Food in the city -- hands down. The food is always flavorful, colorful and fresh. Call me basic, but I love their Chicken Tikki Masala... it's chefs kiss and I love to make a sandwich out of it with a little naan, and rice. Always an enjoyable meal."
1158,"I'm a little surprised that this is one of the highest rated Indian restaurants in New York. The dining experience (ambiance + service) was lovely, however, the food was a little bit of a letdown. Chicken Korma (4/5)  - first time having this dish before. It was sweet and delicious! It came with a good amount of chicken. I would've liked the chicken to be juicier. Also, we got this medium spicy but it wasn't spicy! Chicken Paneer Makhni (4/5) - they told us this was the butter chicken. It was yummy too! Very creamy. For spice level, we chose mild but I didn't taste any spicy. Lamb Curry (3/5) - the lamb itself was great but the curry wasn't that good. We were recommended this dish by our server. We chose medium but this one was significantly more spicy than the Korma. Each dish came with Basmati rice but it tasted uncooked. Each dish was $16-$17, which is definitely more what I find in other cities, but that's to be expected from anywhere in NYC. Oh also, we chose to do the fixe price combo ($22) for one of them. The truth is that it really wasn't really worth it. The appetizer and dessert were both tiny (pictured). But on the bright side, the service was amazing! We were checked on constantly and our waters were refilled almost by the sip."
1159,Highly recommend this place! The food was amazing! We will be frequently returning to Bengal in the near future. The naan was the best naan Iv had
1160,"We had ordered food from Bengal Tiger a couple of years ago and thought the food and delivery experience were excellent. So, when we had an urge for Indian food we ordered from them again. In our opinion, it was a huge mistake. Delivery was timely. Two items we ordered were missing and one item was completely incorrect. So, two items missing and one item wrong in an order that consisted of eight items.  We ordered Aloo Gobi Matar, which was described on the menu as potatoes, peas, ginger and turmeric. Instead, we were delivered some cauliflower dish. The cauliflower was plain, undercooked florets that did not contain potatoes, peas or ginger. The samosas were very good, but every other item had an issue. The onions in the onion nan were burned, and as a result, tasted bitter. All the meat dishes contained a minuscule amount of meat. The chicken in the chicken korma and the lamb in the lamb vindaloo were hard and dry. The sauces were watery and tasteless. The Saag Paneer was bland and contained very little cheese. I'd like to think they just had an off night. I will not, however, order again to find out."
1161,"The lunch special is such great value!!! Tasty and filling! It was actually enough for two lunches for me, so truly, the bang for your buck is great. Quick lunch pickup too, I personally ordered through Caviar / DoordashThe mango lassi is good because it's viscous while not being too sweetWould go back for lunch / dinner without hesitation"
1162,"Every dish is very delicious, lamb somasa and rice pudding are top percentile. I didn't rate a 5 star mainly because their curry are just average, won't surprise you, regular good. We ordered kitchen saag and lamb vindaloo."
1163,"Loved the lunch special here! $15 for an appetizer and a main entree. The main entrees we tried were the chicken tikka and the chicken korma. Both were flavorful and hit the spot for our Indian food craving. Also tried the butternut squash soup, which was good. The portions are generous and are easily split between people. The service was wonderful! The waiters were very attentive, we really appreciated it."
1164,"I felt very safe dining here! Although it is a small restaurant and on the second floor, they ask for vaccination cards before being seated. My water kept getting filled as soon as I took a sip. The waiter was very attentive. The food took a while to come out but it was delicious!! I had their chicken tikka masala. I ordered spicy but it was not as spicy as I thought it would be. If you can handle spice, I recommend asking for spicy!"
1165,"In a couple years, someone will read this review and go ""what is covid? And they checked what cards?""But this place did a great job checking out vaccine cards, really made me feel safer. I ordered the home style chicken curry and my wife the chicken tikka. Both were classic and amazing. We went with the level 7 spiciness, loved every painful bite. Also I personally though the coconut naan was better then the never bad always amazing garlic naan. The coconut naan had a little sweetness which complemented the kick of the curry."
1166,"Hands down the best Indian food I've ever had. The naan bread was so fluffy and soft, absolutely delicious. I ordered the Chana Saag, which was very nicely spiced, and tasted extremely fresh."
1167,"I did lunch special take out and was really impressed!  The meal was an extremely fair price, because the samosa and entree were both large. Sometimes restaurants will give you a smaller entree during lunch time, but Bengal gave a ""dinner-sized"" entree and rice!  We got the tikka masala and the vindaloo. I loved the cream tomato sauce in the tikka. The spice was mild, in my opinion, and I would have gladly drank the sauce on its own!  The vindaloo had so much flavor and I love that the spiciness was subtle. It didn't start spicy, but I built up as you ate more. Such an amazing dish!I highly recommend coming to Bengal for your Indian fix. It was one of the best Indian restaurants that I've been to, and such a fair price!"
1168,"They have a great 3 course meal deal. It is quite a small place, but the wait wasn't too long. The vegetable samosa is very good and the chicken tikka masala as well. The rice pudding dessert was a bit too floral for my taste. I got regular spicy level for the chicken tikka and it had a kick!"
1169,"I was really in the mood for Indian so found this spot as a potential takeout place. Checking out yelp and photos I was sold so I decided to order dinner from this spot.They do a really good prix fixe dinner, for $22 you get an appetizer, entree, and dessert.For appetizer, we got samosas and also the lentil soup and butternut squash soup. The samosas were AMAZING. They were so crispy and flavorful, and huge! The sauces it came with were a spicy sauce and a tamarind sauce. One was sweet the other was spicy. Each meal comes with TWO huge samosas. I was very happy about that. The lentil soup was nice and spiced. Butternut squash had a slight sweet and cinnamon flavor.The entrees. The chicken tikka masala had a very nice flavor profile, very creamy and plenty of large chicken pieces! The lamb curry had alot of lamb and it was a good flavor as well, slightly spicy and the lamb was tender, easy to chew. These two dishes went really well with rice.I definitely had a huge food coma after this and had plenty of leftover for another meal. Great spot with lots of food, great value and taste!"
1170,"Love love love Eileen's! To preface, I generally don't care for cheesecake, as it's usually heavy, thick, and rich. Not my vibe. This local mainstay is different though! The cheesecake made here is light in texture and not overly sweet. Almost addicting! I love the fact that they offer the smaller personal size, which is awesome for trying new flavors. Every time I bring this to any gathering, it's a hit!(The attached photo is from December, they have seasonal designs)"
1171,I saw a video on YouTube about this spot. Had to make my way on my trip to nyc. And omg that was so good. I got the strawberry cheesecake. First bite melted in my mouth. The perfect creamy texture. The sweetness just right. This was a true winner. Best cheesecake I've had yet! A great representation for the big Apple. I heard the salted caramel is the most popular. I'll have to get that on my next visitRecommendation: strawberry cheesecake
1172,"If you like fluffy cheesecake that is rich, but still airy and light, come to Eileen's! Cheesecakes are the perfect amount of sweet and also the perfect size to not make me feel like I can't finish. Got the strawberry one this time and it was delicious! At over $5 for a small 5 bite cheesecake, it's a bit pricy, but still so worth it!"
1173,"I can't believe I've never written a review for this place. Eileen's has hands down been my favorite cheesecake since I was a kid. For real. Every birthday that is the cake I request.  My mom even sent the cake via fedex to me while I was away for college. Yes I'm that obsessed.  When I need a pick me up, Eileen is always there to comfort me with its rich buttery smoothness and perfect crust.  She's like family to me. No, I've never met the lady but her cake makes me feel special. I guess that's why they call it Eileen's special cheesecake. You'll always have a place in my heart. Love you forever and a day."
1174,"There's always a line when I walk by this place, but I finally decided to stop and get some cheesecake to bring to a holiday dinner.Eileen's cheesecakes are so tasty, so creamy, and not overly sweet - a classic New York cheesecake. This place has been around since the 70s and really sets the bar high for cheesecake. Definitely a little pricey but what you would expect for desserts of this caliber. A great splurge for a birthday or celebration. I got a bigger standard cheesecake (8 inch) and 4 small flavored ones ($5.50 each - salted caramel crème brulee, raspberry, Oreo, marbled). All the flavored ones have the same base cheesecake filling, but just with different toppings. Out of the 4, I liked the salted caramel crème brûlée one the best. But just the classic is already perfect."
1175,"I was in and out of there in less than 2 minutes on a Monday afternoon. The classic cheesecake is a must. I'm quite sensitive to overly sweet desserts but I found this to be creamy and the perfect amount of sweetness. The crust is soft and just melts in your mouth. My husband got the coconut and initially, I thought that the base would be similar to the classic cheesecake and they topped it with coconut flakes. I was wrong. The taste is different. Still good though. My husband took a bite of my classic and he thought it was wayyyyyy better. I wouldn't skip out on the classic. FYI, they're the size of a cupcake. They cost $5.50. Quite expensive imo.They also take credit/Apple Pay. There seems to be no minimum."
1176,"You can't go wrong with ordering the plain cheesecake, and either eating it in person or bringing it home and topping it off with fresh fruit. Take advantage of their deals on their anniversary day and National Cheesecake day! The servers behind the glass display are very patient and insightful on which flavors to try."
1177,"I hadn't really thought of New York as a cheesecake destination, but derp I'm stupid as hell. Of course they have great cheesecake options if all the Jewish delis sell it! My friends were visiting New York the weekend before us and asked if I knew any spots. I did not, but I did some quick research and found Eileen's. Then I was like...wait, I should just come here myself too.The thing about Eileen's is that they don't overpower you with huge slices of cheesecake. Rather, you get mini cheesecakes instead. Seems like a huge miss not having slices, but trust me this is the better move because it's not as much AND they're way more photogenic.I came here with a plan to get two cheesecakes, so of course I ended up leaving here with four. Don't blame me, it's not like I come to New York that often! Got the blueberry, marble, red velvet, and dulce de leche. Now I love myself some cheesecake, and this right here is THE BEST I've ever had. It is so soft and fluffy, yet it holds it shape extremely well. Also, sweet but not overly sweet. These cheesecakes honestly have to be experienced firsthand, because anything I tell you right now does not do these cheesecakes justice. Like seriously, DAMN.Staff here are wonderful, no complaints on my end. You come in here, you order, and you leave. They even do a great job of wrapping a bow on your box! Love the small details.One more note that I usually don't get into. I thought this would be a pretentious looking place like Dominique Ansel. No, actually this is about as unassuming a place as you can possibly imagine. If I hadn't seen the 1,000+ reviews of Eileen's on Yelp, I probably would have totally passed by it if I was randomly walking the streets of New York. It's truly a hole-in-the-wall gem.So yeah, with all that being said, you bet your ass I'm coming back here. Eileen's is special!"
1178,"On a recent trip to the East Coast we got to spend approximately 24 hours in New York City. Since food is obviously one of the big motivators in our travel, we decided to get dropped off at a restaurant and simply make our way back to our hotel over the next couple of hours. One of the places we wanted to go to was Eileen's special cheesecake as we've heard the tails of the deliciousness, and felt it was appropriate to go sample some dessert in the middle of the day because we didn't on such a long walk... And obviously we deserved it!This place is awesome! It's very compact, but made getting in and out easy. We were able to choose six small cheesecake bites which gave us a good feel for what they had to offer. Nice combinations of chocolate and fruity warhead and overall, everybody left very happy!This is a perfect place to go check out regardless of your affinity for cheesecake. You'll definitely find something you like and you'll be able to say you've been through!"
1179,"Amazing cheesecakes! I sometimes stay away from cheesecake just cause it can be overly sweet and super heavy, but this place has just the right recipe! The cheesecakes are perfectly portioned so you can have one (or two for me) by yourself. The Dulce de Leche that I ordered was pretty good, but my favorite was the Pineapple. The fruity flavor cut through the cheesecake flavor very nicely. Will definitely be back!"
1180,"AHHHH WORTH THE HYPE. Eileen's was one of my MUST stops whenever I visited NYC, but now that I live here, I am so so happy that I can literally come whenever I want. Their cheesecakes are the perfect balance of tangy and sweet, light and creamy.You can stop by and pick up single servings ($5.50-$6 a piece) or buy entire 6"" and 10"" cakes. They come in a lot of flavors, and I think I've tried every single one! But time and time again, the original continues to be my go to. It's not cheap, but for me, it's worth the treat.In the city of excellent cheesecakes, this one is my personal favorite!!Couples notes for first timers: 1) it's a small, unassuming store front, if not for a line you could totally miss it; 2) the crust is super loose and crumbly and the filling is much softer and lighter than what you may be otherwise used to"
1181,"Eileen's deserves more love. I adored this place. I got strawberry and red velvet both were very good, but the red velvet BLEW ME AWAY. I felt like I could eat that cheesecake all day everyday for forever. It was so good. They don't do slices and instead do mini cheesecakes... which is both adorable and really nice. They come out to about $5 a piece. Definitely get 2 per person... if not more :).Just editing this review to add that 3 weeks later and I'm dreaming about going back to Eileen's. It's absolutely perfect"
1182,"If you love cheesecake, you have to check out Eileen's Special Cheesecake!  If you like cheesecake, you have to check out Eileen's Special Cheesecake!   If you like cheesecake only okay, you you have to check out Eileen's Special Cheesecake!  Miniaturized anything is always a fun concept for food; winners include sliders, mini quiches, pigs in a blanket (to name a few).  However, mini doesn't always work (for example: soups in shot glasses, mini sandwiches); you'd rather have the regular.  With that said, I'd say Eileen's Special Cheesecake is a big winner.  As soon as you walk in, you're going to notice the wide variety of flavors and toppings that  Eileen's was able to unlock even in such small portions.  They really nailed the presentation; everything looks so good, and you'll wish you had room in your stomach for all of it.  If you're usually indecisive, bring a more decisive friend when you visit.On my visit, I bought one plain and one strawberry.  Both tasted great, and they were fun to eat even on the go.  And like any good cheesecake, it wasn't too solid or too liquid; it was just the right level of richness.  Easy 5 stars.  I'll definitely be back to try different flavors!"
1183,"I love how soft and fluffy the cheesecake is here. Not overly sweet either, which is perfect for me as I don't have the biggest sweet tooth. I got the red velvet, strawberry, and pumpkin cheesecake bites. My favorite one out of the three is the classic strawberry one; the strawberry and the strawberry syrup matched very well with the creaminess of the cheesecake (it looks like there's too much strawberry syrup on it but the syrup isn't too rich). Loved the chocolate base of the red velvet one. The pumpkin one was pretty good as well; standard fare for the season but still tasty nonetheless.I'd say they're the perfect little desserts to grab after eating at a restaurant in the area."
1184,"Definitely worth a try! I had the Strawberry and loved it at first bite!! I was so happy to taste that it was not overly sweet. The texture was great. I felt light and guilt-free after. I also love the size of the mini cheese-cake! It was the perfect amount for me and they are also just so cute. I'll definitely be returning to try all of the flavors and whenever I want something sweet! I also love how quick and easy it was to walk in and grab what I wanted. For sure adding this to my list of places where I go to buy group treats. The store itself is a small, cozy spot. The cashier was very welcoming, sweet and patient which confirmed me becoming a returning customer even more."
1185,it's not just the hype... this stuff is freaken BOMB. The perfect balance of sweet and creamy without any overpowering flavors. Me and my boyfriend got a variety of their mini cheesecakes and could not decide our favorite... they are delicious! Must try in ny-- hoping for an LA location
1186,"I finally got to try New York City's finest cheesecake. For my birthday, my family got me the miniature strawberry cheesecake, pecan pie, red velvet, and regular cheesecake. They're all so creamy and smooth!!! The bottom crust is perfectly baked and melts in your mouth. I can't believe it took me this long to try their pastries. I'd recommend this place to all my dessert lovers. You will not be disappointed!"
1187,"Eileen's Special CheesecakeHands down the best cheesecake I've ever had in my entire life and a must-go in my opinion when in nyc! The cheesecake base was so fluffy and light compared to the cheesecakes I've had my entire life (cries in grocery store cheesecake) and it was mind blowing how good these were. We got the following cheesecake tarts: * Salted Caramel* Cookies & Cream* Lemon * Plain My faves were the Plain and Lemon but each one was still the best cheesecake I've ever had in all of my 24 years of life : 10/10: $5.50 for individual tarts, bigger cheesecakes go up to $80"
1188,"THE BEST CHEESECAKE IVE EVER HADD!!!! I got four different flavors of the cheesecake tarts. They were all absolutely divine! The mango cheesecake was a suprising flavor, I've never had a mango flavored cheesecake before and it was definitely a hit. I also tried my friend's oreo cheesecake tarte and it was so yummy, she definitely hated me for the huge bite I took. All the other flavors were also spectacular, light and creamy and not overly sweet. This place is a hidden gem, a tiny corner store on Cleveland st. They don't have space to sit inside and its pretty cramped but beautifully decorated for the holidays. I would definitely recommend checking this place out, you won't regret it!"
1189,"I came to pick up a large strawberry cheesecake last Friday before closing (09/10/21). First, nobody greeted us as we stood there for a few minutes and they looked at us from their kitchen/office or whatever that area behind the counter space is. Then when the gentleman came out, he was polite. We've been getting cheesecake from here since 2007 and always raving about how great it is to everyone. This time, the cheesecake was very crumbly. It barely tasted like anything. I couldn't even cut a slice without it falling apart. I had guests over and was embarrassed at how the plates looked like mush. Nobody was impressed by it and even asked why we go all the way to the city for ""this."" I called Eileen's and the same gentleman picked up. He advised us to email the owner to see what she wants to do. I emailed her on Saturday (09/11/21) and included a picture as well as a video clip of me cutting a slice. It's been a week and no response. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt but I think a week should be enough time to get back to a loyal customer. This will be the last time I get anything from here, and I will no longer be recommending them to people. They don't care about their customers' satisfaction. If you want to charge $55 for a cheesecake, it should be good quality. I understand that sometimes cakes don't come out as planned, but the least you can do is respond and try to make things right. Very disappointed."
1190,"If you want to get the best cheesecake in the area, look no further. The store is so small you might miss it if you're driving by. But once you walk inside, not expecting much, you'll see a huge crowd and variety of different cheesecakes and they all look good. You'll be confused on which one to pick because they all look really good.The price is fair because of how good it was. For  $5.50 you can get any of the type of cheesecakes they make in the store. They're small but there's bigger sizes. But trust me, even if it's small its very worth it. The cake is very soft with so much flavor in it. I tried the Caramel Cheesecake and Strawberry Cheesecake and I can't tell you which one is better because how unique each of them taste. Be prepared to stand in the line as soon ad you walk in, the place is always busy. There's a small menu to your left as you walk in so you can decide which type of cake you want if the crowd doesn't allow u to see the display initially."
1191,"We ordered my birthday cake from Eileen this year.   Typically, we have carvel ice cream cake.  However, my family members love cheesecake.   I submitted my order via their website.   Two days later, I went to the store to pick it up.  I wish the baker had wrote happy birthday on it. Hence,  I didn't give this establishment 5 stars.  The red velvet cake was a hit at my birthday party.  My nephews and niece loved it.   If you never had Eileen's cheesecake, you have to try it.   In my opinion, it's so much better than Juniors."
1192,"My mom ordered the Chocolate Mousse cake for my birthday. They included a candle with the cake which was nice of them. As for the cake itself, it was very rich and fluffy. You can tell that it was made with love!"
1193,"I have been getting Eileen's Cheesecake for many years and I can never get enough! If you hate feeling heavy after one slice of cheesecake, Eileen's is the place! Their cheesecakes are so light and fluffy! I personally am not a fan of dense cheesecakes, so Eileen's does the job. When you cut into the cheesecake, it literally crumbles- that is how fluffy it is! Now ... this might be a bit dangerous because you will be inclined to have more than one slice (lol). My favorite has to be the strawberry cheesecake. It compliments the cheesecake really well and I love that it is superrrrrrrr jammy! Seriously, it is heaven! Their other cheesecakes are good too, but don't skip out on the strawberry cheesecake- you won't regret it."
1194,"This tiny spot has been my favorite cheesecake place for years. I've gotten several of my birthday cakes, special occasion cakes, random Tuesday cheesecake bites, etc. from here. The cheesecake is perfectly fluffy and creamy, not overly sweet and available in my ideal portion size. They also have a ton of flavors but make sure to also try their original plain version. So good!"
1195,Eileen's Special Cheesecake has been on my to do list for YEARS! Thanks to the collections feature in my app I saw it come up in my 'to do' bookmarks when I was wandering around the neighborhood. It's on the corner across from Petrosino Square. The man behind the counter was very nice. They knew I wasn't in a hurry and they definitely took their time considering I was the only customer. As soon as I spotted the Coconut I knew what I wanted. They had lots of little single serving cheesecakes. They are exactly $5.50 each. They take cash which is a plus to me. I went back outside to sit on the bench in front to eat it. I'm not even going to try to describe how good this cheesecake tastes. If they had one with Peanut Butter I'd be in heaven for sure! I'm glad I finally enjoyed Eileen's after all these years. I know I will make it a point to go back. I'm recommending you listen to the hype about this place and go get the cheesecake ASAP!
1196,Oh these cheesecakes are so so delicious and the perfect size too - to indulge but not feel guilty.  I got the raspberry and the plain cheesecake. And they were both so good. Super creamy and not overly sweet!!
1197,"Couldn't leave New York without trying cheesecake! The workers were super friendly and the mini cheesecakes were the perfect size and sweetness for any occasion. If you like light, airy, and fluffy cheesecakes, this place will hit the spot. Plain Cheesecake Tart ($5.25)// I love the taste of cheesecake and the original did not disappoint. It wasn't too sweet and the texture was super light. My favorite of the four! Strawberry Cheesecake Tart ($5.50) // The fresh strawberry topping was a nice addition to the classic, as it provided a bit of tartness and additional sweetness!  Salted Caramel Cheesecake Tart ($5.50) // It was on the sweeter side compared to the other cheesecakes we got, but still just as delicious!  Lemon Cheesecake Tart ($5.50) // Loved this one as well. The tart lemon flavor balanced the sweetness nicely but wasn't too overpowering."
1198,"I'm normally not the person who goes for extremely sweet desserts like this, but after hearing raving reviews about this place I just had to check it out. If you want to get cheesecake that is just enough for one person, this is the place to go! The mini cheesecakes are round instead of slices, so it's perfect if you want to get those cute photos. The only issue I had with this is that it crumbles immediately when you bite into it and I normally expect cheesecake to hold its shape pretty well. Nevertheless it tasted amazing!"
1199,"No explanation needed for this classic spot. It's Eileen's cheesecake for god sake. It's really good, with different flavor selections."
1200,"I came on a Friday morning to grab some mini cheesecakes for a friend's birthday.When I go to the store there was only one other person in the store. Therefore, the wait was ok. As stated in previous reviews these cheesecakes are light, creamy and fluffy. Its flavor isn't too overwhelming and was very pleasant. My only complaint would be that they are slightly too crumbly for the type of cheesecakes I'm used to and a little small for the price. I decided to choose the pumpkin, cherry, blueberry and raspberry mini cheesecakes. I love the idea of mini cheesecakes so you can try lots of different flavors. My favorite flavors were the cherry and raspberry. Loved that icing with the raspberry and the cherry topping was delicious. The blueberry I thought was ok even though it was very sweet there was a slight bitter aftertaste for some reason. I'm not a big pumpkin fan in general so I wasn't the biggest fan of their pumpkin one; however, my friend enjoyed it. All in all, a solid establishment if you're craving some cheesecakes."
1201,"I am very conflicted as this is more of a 3.5/5 than a true 4/5. There sadly are better cheesecakes in NYC, but Eileen's isn't anything to thumb your nose at. I think the biggest issue is, it's too light and too expensive for what it is. If you have to absolutely try it, you won't leave unhappy... but please also try some other places while you're here. Cheesecake galore is abound!"
1202,"I got the small ones - strawberry, blueberry, raspberry and plain. I liked that the cheese cake itself was not too sweet and dense.  It was light, fluffy and best part it wasn't sweet nor dense as other cheesecakes that I had before.Definitely would revisit.  Love that they have personal size ones, try the plain for sure."
1203,"Great personal-sized cheesecakes! Creamy and smooth, and just the right size. Small shop, so the line can get long, but it moves fast."
1204,Not much to say other than BEST cheesecake I've ever had. Absolute best! The mini cheesecakes are just the perfect size to satisfy your sweet tooth craving.
1205,"The cheesecake itself is ok, nothing special. I can't, for the life of me, understand the hype, as it is quite bland flavor wise. The price is ridiculous and definitely not worth it. If this was a 2-3 dollar mini cheesecake...maybe. But 5,50???Maaaany other better places around."
1206,"Cheese cake with salted caramel cream brûlée is to die for. I like how they r so tiny so u don't get fat lol but we always get up get it 3-4 PCs anyway what's the point right? They made one of the best cheesecakes I be ever had . So cheesecake definitely 5 stars. But cashiers can be a bit nicer . Like more friendly , it would make all the experience soo much better ."
1207,There's nothing special about the cheesecakes from here. First things first they are overpriced at $5.50 for a tiny circle of cheesecake with a super thin crust. The actual cheese doesn't have any flavor. The girl at the front had an attitude as well on a Saturday night. Ive had better cheesecake at a cheaper price.
1208,"I wish I've gotten a whole cheesecake. This was pretty great! It is tiny for the price though, its a size of my palm for like $5.5 dollars. This cheesecake is so smooth, like it's a harder version of pudding. does that make sense? no? go try it yourself and figure that out. This location was close to little italy/soho so it's a good location but the store itself is also tiny. Next time I will be getting a whole cheesecake!"
1209,"Was in the neighborhood and needed some dessert and with this place right near me of course I had to buy one (or 5 to be specific). They're only open for takeout right now but service is still very friendly and helpful. 1 of their boxes perfectly holds 4 cheesecakes so I ordered 4 to go as well as a single mini cheesecake to eat as I walked.I ordered the following: dulce de leche, pumpkin, creme brulee, cookies and cream, and raspberry. The raspberry is fairly classic with some nice tart and sweet jam on top to contrast against the cheesecake. The cookies and cream was another winner with the slightly tangy cheese pairing well against the chocolatey oreo cookies. The pumpkin one was another favorite of mine. It basically tastes like the middle ground of a cheesecake and pumpkin pie (which are both top desserts for me). While the dulce de leche and creme brulee were both good I wasn't totally blown away. The cheesecakes in general were fluffy and not too dense with a fairly thing crust. I do usually prefer a denser cheesecake bu since these are specialty flavors I think the lighter texture/flavor actually works in their favor. Overall, I'm not necessarily dying to come back but I definitely won't oppose stopping in if I'm in the neighborhood."
1210,"Classic.If you want to know what a classic cheese cake is like. This is the place you want to go.Creamy. Like when u put your fork into it. You can feel how creamy it is by how your fork glides.The cheesecake is a bit on the heavier side. But tbh I'm used to that. The crust is light which I. Appreciate. It adds texture and a bit of flavor, but when the crust is light it doesn't take away from the cheesecake.Great place to start on a cheesecake journey."
1211,Unfortunately I was half way into my cheesecake when a strand of hair was found.. I had to throw out the rest of the cake as I was afraid to find more.
1212,"Let's be real, like many of you, having had all types of cheesecakes throughout my life, I wasn't sure how this place was going to be any different. For New York Style we got Juniors, Japanese style we have the bouncy ones as well as the soft cheese mousse ones I grew up getting from the Japanese Bakeries in HK, Italian ones are a little more torte-like with more emphasis on the cheeses( pretty sure they don't use cream cheese on those), so after hearing such good things about Eileens cheesecake, I kept my expectations low. Might as well just be another tourist spot, I thought to myself. But nope, it's the real deal! And look at all those interesting flavors!!!! I got to try three different kinds. Original was soft and creamy and not overly sweet, pure perfection, dulce de leche was caramel-y as promised, but the knockout star for me was truly the mango cheesecake, as recommended by the staff here. Admittedly I have unrealistically high standards for my Mango flavors as I was spoiled  growing up in Asia, living not too far from the Philippines so we always had ample supply of the best quality mangoes. I believe Manila mangos and Alphonso mangos are the best type. And the mango purée they use for the cheesecake here is definitely one of the two. Divine! Will definitely go back for more mango and maybe try the chocolate and red velvet flavors next.Eileens the real deal! And the people who work there are the sweetest! I took off one star because the prices are a little high (over $5) for a cupcake sized piece. On a brighter note, it's better for my waistline :)"
1213,Cheesecake is divine here. It's soft and taste delicate. Very different from the harder texture of most NY cheesecake. I tried the pineapple topping and the strawberry topping-both were amazing.
1214,"Super cute little place with DELICIOUS cheesecake. A little pricey, but totally worth it. I had the pumpkin cheesecake and it was heavenly. My mom had the cherry, and said it was very good too. Highly recommend!"
1215,"Best bite sized cheesecake! A little pricey for the size of the cheesecake but they have some amazing flavors and it's all so light and have the perfect amount of sweetness.  We got their strawberry, plain and blueberry cheesecake and we loved it all."
1216,The portion size was perfect. I got the dulce de leche and the flavor was lacking in my opinion. I tried my friend's pineapple cheesecake and that was much better. Service was fast and friendly.
1217,"Eileen's cheesecakes comes recommended when searching for NYC's best cheesecake. We tried the mango mini cheesecake - light and fluffy, with a delicate crust. The mango flavor was infused throughout the cheesecake."
1218,"I had heard amazing things about Eileen's cheesecakes, so I decided to pick up a few mini cheesecakes to try a variety of flavors. I asked the cashier to recommend me the most popular flavors, and so the four flavors I got were 100% picked by her.Regardless of taste, I think these cakes are WAYYYYYY overpriced. These mini cheesecakes can fit in a child's palm, and could be finished in 2-3 adult bites. I know this bakery has a lot of hype, but charging over $5 for a tiny cake means it better be the most euphoric experience ever, which didn't happen for me.I didn't give Eileen's 3 stars because if you like lighter, fluffier cheesecakes, you will really like the cheesecakes here. I personally prefer a denser, sweeter cheesecake where you can really taste the sweetness. I got a hint of cheesecake flavor, but it was really light. And for the other cakes, I tasted next to nothing on the salted caramel, and slight pumpkin spice on the pumpkin. The strawberry was flavored well without tasting artificial. The graham ""crust"" on these cakes is the perfect amount, and balances out the cake. Aside from the strawberry, I didn't think these cakes delivered enough on flavor and my preferred density, so they couldn't justify the price. However, if I knew I had a friend that liked the lighter cheesecake consistency, I would probably splurge on a larger strawberry cheesecake from Eileen's. It is nice that you can have a dessert that doesn't feel grossly heavy, but I still think light deserts can pack more flavors."
1219,"Let me preface this review with a clarification: I'm not a big cheesecake person. I don't like to be punched in the palate by coyingly sweet and thick cream cheese. And that is why I like Eileen's so much, I would say that they are one of the top cheesecake places for me. Fluffy and light. I can have a mini/individual with tea or coffee without feeling like I ate a truck of cream cheese.The only downer for me with Eileen's is the very thin graham cracker crust. I wish there is more.Always good pick with a plain cheesecake or a fruit topping for the tartness to go with the cheesecake. For me the salted caramel and the occasional coconut ones a must to sample. Eileen's cookies are also pretty good, a bit more crunch with little chew is perfect in my book.I have placed orders for their 6"" and 10"" cheesecakes and other baked goods through the years and they have always been good and prompt. People are always thrilled when they see the good from here, Eileen's is definitely a crowd pleaser."
1220,Loved my experience for brunch at ABC Kitchen. The inside was very trendy and the decor was cute. I got the cardamom dutch baby pancakes which were delicious. Had a very unique taste but very hearty for a breakfast. We also got some potatoes and bacon for the table and the bacon was crispy and divine. Loved my strawberry champagne too.
1221,"Quality food, limited menu and not so many vegetarian options (although more than ABCV allegedly). I ordered the roast carrot and avocado salad for my main dish, while it was decent [4/5], it wasn't particularly exciting as a main meal and there weren't a lot of other vegetarian options on the larger side, other than a pasta.Service was woefully slow and not particularly friendly either. I'd give it another chance but I can't say it was as good as I was expecting."
1222,"Went here for lunch with a friend and enjoyed lunch and the service! We were indecisive between lunch and dinner, so we had the pancake as well as the pizza and calamari. I also had a mimosa which was great.Vibe is very chill and nice. Would definitely recommend in the future."
1223,"ABC Kitchen, you're almost the perfect spot for me to dine with my non-vegan friends! The ambience is amazing, all of their restaurants are very Instagram-friendly. I came here with my sister for a nice dinner and was shocked to see that ABC Kitchen, part of a franchise that has a vegan restaurant (ABC V), didn't have anything ""vegan"" on their menu. You would think that they would understand that adding vegan options makes a really big difference to people who are vegan. It really surprised me. Luckily the waitress was super helpful but when restaurants don't offer a vegan option it usually leads to an unnecessarily painful experience. All three stars go to my waitress because she knew her stuff!Since they don't offer a vegan entrée I ordered more food than I would've liked, spending more money than I would've liked in result. I ended up getting a pizza with no cheese and a salad. The pizza was so thin and small -  there was even a hole in the middle of the dough and it was hard to eat. It was delicious but, for the price, I was surprised. The salad was also super good but definitely not the same without cheese. Both of these options were supposed to have cheese on them which would make them more filling and adds some protein. There wasn't any vegan protein in my meal like a nut-based cheese substitute or chickpeas for the salad. These little details make a big difference to vegans. Our waitress was amazing - she was able to walk me though my options without having to ask. Sometime I can tell the staff doesn't know what vegan means and I'm nervous to get me food - I had zero stress. I also knew that if they messed up my food she would catch it. I wish I could give more stars but our meal was very pricey and I find it ridiculous that a franchise with a vegan restaurant doesn't even have the word ""vegan"" on their menu."
1224,"I'm glad indoor dining has resumed in NYC, and I can enjoy the dinner without suffering from the chilly winter. The entrance of the restaurant is very low-key and easy to miss at night. I like the decor and ambience in the main dining room. The food were tasty, and the service was great. I was so full after the dinner. The only downside was the time limit on dining due to limited capacity during the pandemic. Would love to come back again after the pandemic."
1225,"Sadly, ABC Kitchen after Covid has been such a disappointment. Turnover in staff has left the restaurant ill-equipped to manage high quality and knowledgeable waitstaff. When I dined there in August 2021, my appetizer  included seasonal melon which was rock hard and unripened. When I mentioned this to the waiter, he shrugged and did not know how to respond. Another waiter came by, and said that the melon was the best the chef had. I told the second waiter that the chef should not serve unripened melon, but I got just another shrug. It's sad when management doesn't care about providing the highest quality service of the highest quality food."
1226,"Came here with family and really enjoyed the experience.  The service was attentive, but not annoying about it while being really nice.  The cocktails were the highlight of the menu, but the food was also delicious.  I ordered the hamburger with jalapeños and fries, which was really good.  I would definitely suggest bringing friends for their cocktails and bar bites."
1227,"I came here for a brunch reservation with some friends. The ambience was nice and I enjoyed the food, but as another reviewer pointed out, I was a little disappointed by the lack of vegan options. Although I'm not vegan, I'm lactose and dairy intolerant. Also, I don't like salad, so I felt limited in my options (the pancakes, baked eggs, etc all contained dairy as a main component!). The waiter felt bad for me too when I mentioned this, but I made do with an oat latte, apple cider donuts, a side of bacon, and roasted potatoes. I also took some of my boyfriend's eggs benedict (but just a bit).It was all very good, but I do hope ABC Kitchen expands their menu in the future or trains their waiters on providing recommendations for those with dietary restrictions!"
1228,"This review if for my lunch experience PRE-COVID19. My friends and I had reservations here (fortunately because there was a line even before they opened). We had a delightful lunch (pre-fixed menu which included appetizer, salad, main entree and dessert). Food was flavorful, I would say New American cuisine. Yes this spot is trendy and fun but I love it! The establishment is a bit pricey but well worth it. Amazing ambiance and the customer service was on point. Check out my pictures!"
1229,I had heard that they were doing outdoor dining in winter right and I was able to check it out last night and they are!  The space feels opened yet covered and warm. The experience is unique because they are cooking out of all three kitchens and have selections from all menus. All the dishes we had were share-able and delicious. Timing of things were not exactly what I would expect normally but it's to be expected with a limited staff and three different kitchens and one bar. I would recommend this highly to any friends looking for a location near Union Square. And as expected the plates/glasses/cutlery was goals.
1230,"Daniel was probably the best meal and service I've ever had at any restaurant,  all the staff was extremely nice, friendly & helpful with questions about the menu, We were in a rush to get to a broadway show,  so I didn't quite get the full 2-3 hour experience but everything we tasted so amazing!If I get the chance I would definitely come here at least 1 more time for a longer experience with more courses of daniels delicious spectacular food!"
1231,An experience for the books.How it works:Choice of 4 or a pre planned 7 tasting course. My date and I just decided to go with the 7 to get the full experience. Portions are small but by the end you are stuffed. Dessert comes out as trio you share. All the dishes were beautiful and really tasty. I was only disappointed with the one cod dish. While beautifully presented they missed the mark with the blood orange sauce which was a shame. The whole meal took us around 4 hours to complete. So ensure you are in good company when you embark on the journey.
1232,"O Daniel, it is good to be back.I used to come every month or two back in the day when work allowed.  With the kids and moving to the burbs, and the new wave of international chef menus all over the place, it took almost 10 years to come back.  This was the first restaurant I thought of when my daughter requested a ""fancy French restaurant"" for her birthday.*It DID NOT disappoint.We opted for the 4-course because it allowed us more opportunity to taste the menu for our family of 4.My son said it was the best escargots ever, and this was despite our last visit to Paris and the Normandy coast.  Same for the foie in the second course (NOT the first, which is a terrine).  Our server did the flambé tableside, so it was a super considerate treat for my kids.Scallops, sea bass,  venison, and rabbit were excellent interpretations and did a great interplay of flavors.  I thought it was funny for our server to ask my daughter how to serve her venison (she was like "" shouldn't it always be medium-rare?"" to me).  We both thought it would be criminal otherwise.The only negative was the fluke; it is such a light mild fish in general.  It tasted best when taken as a mouthful combo with the radish/fern/etc, but mine fell off the fork so then...it was just bland by itself.  A stronger (fatty) rich fish will add more pizazz to this course.  Also, that pork rib-eye was monster-size and looked so out of place there.  The dessert, as always, was sublime.  My kids actually don't eat much sweets but I had to stop them from licking their plate.  I think the matcha tropezienne and vacherin were just incredibly creative and unexpected.  Those mini-Madeleines were wolfed down faster than mortal breathing.  The canelé suffered a tiny burn; but was still very moist and rich inside. Servers were very insightful. They were able to immediately give my kids the correct pointers about their drinks and menu selections without being pushy.  The only things my kids didn't like were indeed the items they pointed out were a ""little different.""  Can't wait to go back."
1233,"No valet parking :(There are two parking garages nearby and it's about $65.Restaurant is beautiful. I loved that we got to sit next to each other on a comfortable couch like seat. Loved the little stool for my bag.Checked our coat in and was seated.Service was amazing! Food was good. I was so full.White cosmo- soooo good! Light and refreshing and beautifulDirty martini- this is the best I've tried. My bf has been here and he always tells me how Daniels is his fav restaurant and how they make the best dirty martinis. Now I know. We ended up ordering another one before leaving cus it was so goodPimms cup- a little on the sweeter side but deliciousEspresso- so goodAmerican coffee- also really goodWe did the 4 course pre fixe menu. We wanted to try the 7 but didn't think we could both finish it. Good thing we didn't.The amuse bouche was so good. I think it was like potato fennel with anise cracker, potato fennel soup, and some other thing. The first two was our favorite from the threeBread- so pretty! Came out hot and the salted butter was so good too. Apparently this shape keeps the bread warmer..?We got diff things so we could try more...First course:Foie gras- goodCauliflower soup with some seafood and caviar- soup was soooo yummy. Dipped some bread in it as well :)Second course:Sea bass: goodArtic char: really similar to salmon in the way it looks and tasted.Main:Pork ribeye: good but I think we expected moreBison: there's an additional charge but def worth it. Meat is lean and everything was good.Dessert:Hazelnut dessert: decadentMatcha kiwi dessert: light and not a strong matcha flavor. I wouldn't mind if the matcha was stronger. I really liked the kiwi and the kiwi jam or something on the plateMadeleine: the best I've had! Came out hot and sooooo good. And it was small and cuteChocolate bonbon:We got one of each...Dark chocolate with passion fruit, dulce de leche and hibiscus, yuzu, milk chocolate and chicory.. idk but it was all really good. We both liked the dark chocolate the best with the passion fruit. I really enjoyed all 4 differentlyTake home:Canele: ate this with my sisters and we enjoyed it :)I had a great experience and food was good. Service was excellent! I loved all the recommendations from our waiter. We ended up liking my dishes that she recommended :) I don't think there were things that made me go wow. When I think about what I ate and how much we spent idk if it's worth it but the experience is what makes it worth it I guess. I've been to a few Michelin star restaurants and I think I always expect more but I think it's cus I expect things to be more innovative and diff and it's not always like that. I'm clearly not an expert. Not sure if it was worth it but it was worth it because I got to enjoy a nice dinner and celebrate a special occasion and Daniels really helped us celebrate our anniversary well which I forgot to mention. They gave us a blood orange chocolate dessert which was also really good. I think I tasted grapefruit too but not sure"
1234,"Food: 3/5 disappointing for a 2 Michelin star restaurant! Atmosphere: 5/5 the venue was great Plating: 5/5 beautiful dishes! Just look at the photos I've been to other nice restaurants in NYC (Michelin and non-Michelin), and I had been looking forward to trying Daniel. I typically would say I'm impressed with a restaurant if most dishes are solid and at least 1-2 dishes stick out as amazing.  Unfortunately, Daniel fell short of my expectations as far as food goes. I came here with several friends, and we each did the 4 course prixe fixe. Since we shared dishes, I was able to try 8-10 different dishes.  I recommend (dishes I liked): (1) escargot (first course)(2) Piedmont Noisette (hazelnut dessert)(3) Smokey pear cocktail (delicious)Dishes I thought were ok (fine but nothing special):-foie gras (I tried both): they were both more metallic / less tasty in flavor than other fois gras I've had-fluke (pretty meh fluke)-Arctic char (also meh)-venison (slightly better of the two main dishes I tried)I think you should skip:-dry aged striploin: The temperature was fine, but I didn't find the meat to be particularly juicy or flavorful. It was honestly kind of bland?  -Washington apple tatin (dessert): this dish was actually too strange for my tastes - the goat milk ice cream reminded me of sour milk. The apple tatin part was also strange.I don't think I would come back here soon since there are many other fine dining restaurants in the city that I prefer, but I did appreciate the friendly staff and the nice cocktails."
1235,"Excellent restaurant, constantly the best service I've ever receive. This spot has 2 Michelin stars, but is my sisters favourite spot (above some three michelin spots too). I usually go during the spring since their duck is phenomenal, but decided to come with my family in January since we hadn't been since COVID. They no longer have the bread basket (which was one of my favourites) but instead, they have an intricately shaped baguette, that looks like a wreath??. They also still serve the brioche with the foie gras appetizer, and were kind enough to bring out a few extra for us since that's our usual favourite from the bread bowl.We opted for the 4 course prix fixe ($181) since the tasting menu didn't have the dishes we wanted. I got the Morro Bay Oysters, Upstate NY Foie Gras, and Highland Farm Venison.Before the food even came, they gave us amuse bouche based on cauliflower. This immediately set the tone for a fantastic meal. Love love loved every bite of this!Oysters were alright, but didn't blow me away. The juxtaposition with the pork rillettes was a bit strange- I think the two flavors may have been better separate as the pork flavor was a bit too strong.Upstate NY Foie Gras was good. The dish is an entire show, with the server coming out and lighting the entire dish on fire and artfully preparing and pouring sauce in front of you. The pumpkin bread was also great. I personally preferred their previous foie gras preparation as I thought the sauce and sides weren't sweet enough, but still very good!Highland Farm Venison was a very beets-heavy dish - so good! The venison was tender and there was a huge variety of beets to eat. I also tried the Pennsylvania Roasted Pheasant which was phenomenal- wish I had ordered this! So so soft- the meat fell off the bone and was wonderfully flavored.Dessert was overflowing, with madeleines, chocolate, cake, etc. Amazing as always!"
1236,"Went to daniel to celebrate a birthday and to try a michelin star restaurant in the city of new york. There is no questions on the service in any michelin star restaurants but the creativity and taste make a difference.We tried the tasting menu, my favorite dishes were the flute, the bison and the bread with butter was to die for. The foie gras and  venison were ok, i had better in other restaurants. Daniel restaurant is a beautiful experience and a foodie destination"
1237,I came here on a special occasion. I definitely enjoyed every single dish I had. Favorite ones are Flake and Foie Gras which imo very much reflect chef's creativity and aesthetic. We sat on the table in the middle of the main dining room. Atmosphere was great. One of the two stars restaurants I will definitely come back.
1238,"As a French, I always wanted to try ""Daniel"" by Daniel Boulud. I spent many year in the NY/NJ area but didn't have time to try it. For Christmas Eve, I wanted something special and Daniel was a long time due.My experience has been excellent. Here is my journey at Daniel:1. Welcome: The entrance is classic, the host is taking care of your personal coats and introduce you to the restaurant entrance.2. Restaurant / Design: The restaurant is very class. The art on the wall was excellent and the design is really amazing, very elegant. The jacket is required and makes it a beautiful restaurant like in the photos of 1930's in NY.3. Wine: We were given the wine list to start. It's just amazing, can't beat it. We took by the glass and selected the best Chateauneuf du Pape. The wine was amazing and very generous and large glasses.4. Table: We had a nice table, felt a bit private, so we were happy. The view was on the entire restaurant main room. The table was well decorated with fresh flowers and a nice real candle. They gave also a small little chair for the bag which is elegant and nice. Every detail is nice from the plate quality and brand, to the glass and to the Nagomi knife!5. Service: The service is stealth and exceeding expectations. I think it's the best service as you do not wait and you do not notice it, you do not have to ask for anything, everything is taking of before you even think about it.6. Appetizers: The first set of 3 amuse bouches were excellent. A real culinary experience,  the first appetizer was a fish prepared similar to a sashimi but the presentation was just amazing with edible and tasteful sauces. The bread was warm and amazingly presenting. You really feel you have a 2 stars Michelin at this time. The pâté-Foie Gras appetizer was also just amazing, again delicious and the presentation excellent. I was really astonished.7. Main course: I selected the dry aged beef. It was exceptional and really really well prepared. The sauce was also amazing. It was delicious. I'm used too dry beef but not cooked that well, it's perfection.8. Desserts: The best part, I'm not a dessert person so the Île Flottante was exceptional to find and really the best I had in my life. The chocolate dessert of my partner in crime was delicious too. We were also happy to see the presentation of the Christmas dessert. The presentation of the desserts was just amazing. We loved them!9. Gift: they finished the courses with a gift of Macarons. They were also delicious/well prepared. The waiter offered a small bag to help us during our travel.10. I had a good conversation with Karim, the manager, on few personal suggestions and it was very well received. The personal touch and management from Karim is also really making the difference in term of perception.Overall, really happy to taste the food of the Chef Daniel Boulud. We enjoyed one of the best table in the world so it's a very positive moment for us!"
1239,"I know this is better late than never, but I had to review this place.My husband and I were on our honeymoon back in September 2021 and we decided to do an east coast trip and NY was one of our cities to visit. Because it was our honeymoon, we decided to eat somewhere that was highly recognized in the culinary scene and Daniel popped up on our list. Unfortunately, we were unable to dine inside because they were renovating at the time, but Daniel was offering outside seating and a pre-fixed menu during the time we went and O-M-G everything was incredible.I apologize I don't have the names of the top of my head of the dishes, but each dish served I was ""WOW"" after each first bite. This was my first time eating legit French cuisine and was I delighted to have tasted it for the first time at DANIEL. (See the photos for reference) The one thing I do remember is that the little house made madeleines were SUPER cute!The service was outstanding even though it was outside in a makeshift patio, but I told my husband the next time we come we're eating there again."
1240,"Clarification, my dining experience for Daniel was when they indeed had outdoor seating. As commented on my review by their general manager, they no longer offer outdoor seating. I have never dined at Daniel for indoor seating, but I would expect it to be an improvement overall from my experience. Perhaps I will return for an updated review in the future."
1241,First time back at Daniel since the Pandemic and the terrific renovation of the restaurant unveiled in October. The iconic space is lighter and brighter with modern touches. While I have been eating in this room for decades -- it was Le Cirque's original home -- it has never looked better. What has not changed is the amazing food and service. It is a true New York classic. No better place for a celebration or a nice Tuesday night dinner.
1242,"Finally got to knock this one off the list, I have been wanting to eat here for many years. Everything was superb! I was hoping they had a tasting menu which surprisingly they did not so I just ordered several things kind of making my own. I started with some iberico ham which I have always wanted to try and it was very light and delicate. Then went with a salad and for the mains I chose the duck breast. It was all what you would expect a 2 Michelin star place to be perfectly delicious and meticulously beautiful plates. Would love to go back for another round."
1243,"I had a big contract at stake and I took my very picky foreign clients out for dinner at Daniel. Let me start with the fact that I got the contract and Daniel had definitely contributed to it.The place is gorgeous! Ever since it opened in 1993 it took its well deserved place among the pillars of NYC restaurants. I'm a huge fan of chef Daniel Boulud and I've been to most of his restaurants in the US - always an impeccable experience.We ordered a seven course tasting menu paired with wine tasting, from which I especially loved:- the upstate New York foie gras, which was a bit different from any foie gras I've had but with a very interesting kick to it- cauliflower velouté that somehow reminded me of my childhood, definitely cooked with love- the highland farm venison that was incredibly gentle, melted in our mouths- the soup dishThe desserts were over the top breathtaking! We got the persimmon as well as the croquant, which as a huge fan of chocolate I loved the most.The staff was so attentive and accommodating, they even let us switch the table mid dining by request of my clients. The whole experience was astonishing, they took their time with me explaining every dish, I also love asking how the chef recommends eating it and they were extremely patient.I highly recommend visiting Daniel if you can get a reservation, it holds up to the highest standards chef Daniel Boulud sets up to himself. Easily my best French dining experience in the city."
1244,"My husband and I went to Daniel last night to celebrate our anniversary, and we were blown away by our experience. We've been dying to go for a long time, and we're excited to finally get in when a reservation opened up.Though we enjoyed the seven course tasting menu (especially the bread, white truffle scented consomme, and the incredible desserts - all were a 10/10), the wine pairing, and the delicious cocktails, and the white-glove service made for the best dining experience we've ever had.Our server, Matthew, did such a great job and was very warm and attentive. Everyone at Daniel was kind and knowledgeable from describing cocktails to us, beautifully explaining each wine during the pairing, helping make everything gluten free to accommodate my food allergy, and making our anniversary feel special. As we were leaving, they gave us extra desserts to-go and even a beautiful booklet that said Happy Anniversary and included each dish we ate. It all felt really special and made for a very romantic evening. Were we blown away by every single dish? No, but we don't eat French food very often. But the atmosphere and impeccable service made for an overall 5-star experience."
1245,"I came here yesterday to celebrate my anniversary with my boyfriend and my experience at Daniel was phenomenal from start to finish. We had an early 5 pm reservation since we had a show to catch at 8 pm. The seven course tasting menu takes approximately 3 hours but they were able to have us out shortly after 7 pm.We considered doing the four course tasting since I was a little intimidated by 7 courses, but it wasn't too overwhelming, especially since they were able to make some small accommodations (e.g salad instead of foie gras). My favorite dishes were the Kona abalone and the lamb. Absolutely heavenly. The best lamb I've ever tasted. I loved how they also threw in a few extras too, like a small squash soup cup starter to ""clean our palate"" and freshly baked mini madeleine cookies after dessert. The whole atmosphere was very upscale.  The dress code is jackets for men and no jeans (although I did see one woman in jeans but she looked like a regular).We even had umbrellas that we brought with us  and they gave us a small stool to put it on.  Everything is designed to look immaculate.  Very Michelin worthy."
1246,This has to be the best meal I've ever had. Fine dining and French cuisine at its best . And I was served my food like I was the queen of the world... must must must try if you're looking for a fine dine set course menu. The tasting menu was as good as it loooked or probably better... and I would totally recommend the wine pairingThe lemon tart is absolute sorcery
1247,What can I say about Daniel restaurant. Two Michelin Stars that's it. That's the review. I loved it.
1248,"My wife and I try to go someplace amazing for our anniversary and this place did not disappoint! This is in the top 2 of all time along with Per Se and beats out places like 11 Madison (pre-vegetarian), Le Bernadin and many others. We did the tasting menu, no wine pairing, just champagne and pinot. Highlights were the foie gras, fluke, scallops and venison. However, the wreath shaped bread with French butter was so good! I had to get a refill which made it almost impossible for me to finish all the courses. Almost. I somehow managed to finish everything and each dish was awesome! There were two dessert choices and so we were able to have both. But then they also gave us a complimentary anniversary blood Orange dessert that was beautiful! And there were additional desserts as well as a take home mini cake in a bag that was also delicious. WhT a wonderful experience!! We have never repeated a restaurant before but we may need to make an exception for Daniel."
1249,"This was a review from May 2021- it was for my husband's birthday that we've finally been able to make a reservation for Daniel. It was straight forward via online. We did the multiple courses with the wine pairing. We are pretty good wine drinkers, so we surprised ourselves at how much we needed to catch up (not necessarily a bad thing!). Definitely worth it. We even were greeted by Chef Daniel for a brief conversation, which made us so happy! I was tempted for a selfie, but I didn't want to appear that lame.  The food was amazing, along with the pairings. Service was friendly and professional. Beware to customers, the bathrooms were not handicap accessible for anyone with issues with stairs. It wasn't a problem for me, but I did see an older lady struggle a little bit."
1250,"THE BEST. The entire experience was stellar. We had Alan as our server and his entire entourage was spectacular. So very international. From Ecuador, Mexico, and Senégal. I was impressed with how wonderful the staff was. And of course the food...all you have to do is look at the pics. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
1251,"Now I'm jaded by the perfection of my experience here and nothing else will compare. Superb dining experience in all aspects. We are trying to support local restaurants in this period but also in times like this an experience such as the one we shared at Daniel gives us hope NYC is still alive and will be well with a new normal. We chose to sit outside and chose Daniel for no special occasion but to celebrate life. Every single moment was on point. The outside dining cabanas are the best in the city and each have their own space heaters and curtains that close for privacy. So lovely decorated and they gave me a velvet foot stool for my purse.The service was friendly but professional and impeccable and always on time. We never felt rushed and were even presented glasses of water with the check. Also the staff has really cool chic uniforms. The crowd is diverse and fun. Social Distancing was practiced. The food was perfectly prepared in taste, portion and presentation. I have food allergies and they were very accommodating to my requests. I had the baby lettuce salad and Sasso Chicken with mashed potatoes and my friend had the arugula salad and Cod. We had the chocolate tort for desert and it was sprinkled gold and was the creamiest most delicious desert I ever ate. Our drinks were tops and so is the wine list. Wonderful meal! Next month is my Birthday so I hope to go back to eat inside and enjoy the exquisite decor. There were tables by the bar and a few stools where people were waiting.They took temperatures entering and required masks entering and took all the Covid precautions. I felt safe and protected.Merci beacoup Daniel! Stellar job!"
1252,"Not worth the price tag. Was the food good? Sure. Better than most restaurants? Nope, not at all. Nothing was particularly impressive or memorable. We did the $275 tasting menu and $175 wine pairing and the most memorable thing I had was the course that was a single piece of white asparagus. It was good but if after $450, all I can remember is a single piece of white asparagus, no thanks. I think there are plenty of other places you can spend your money at."
1253,"Disclaimer: Review for visit before Covid.Among the best meals I've ever had. Everything at Daniel is impeccable. We were celebrating a birthday here, and they definitely made sure that we had a memorable experience.The restaurant interior and decor is extravagant. It's a large space, and with the high ceilings and art museum worthy paintings, it is quite the venue. Dining here felt like an extraordinary experience, before you even start dining. I've been to other two and three Michelin star restaurants in New York, but Daniel stands out even among them. The best part was that the service was still friendly and not uptight/rigid.I won't go through each thing on the 4 course menu, but what stood out the most to me was the variety of meats they offered. I had Abalone (sea snail) and Venison (elk/deer) for 2 of my courses, both of which are not that common. The Abalone was a personal favorite for me, the presentation was interesting too as it was surrounded with different kinds sea shells.They gave us a complimentary Cannelle at the end, and my god it was the best Cannelle I've ever had by a mile! Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside - this is as good as a Canelle can be. Our dinner certainly felt special, and they gave us a menu with everything we ate as well as a personalized message to remember the night by.On our way out of the restaurant, we were admiring the painting near the entrance and ran into Daniel Boulud himself! He spoke to us for a bit and even offered to take a picture of us at the end. That really was the cherry on top of the cake."
1254,"Experience was perfect before we even walked in. We were running late due to rain, but a quick call to to the host reassured us that our table would be held and waiting for us. When we arrived, that friendly tone held, and every moment of our visit was positive, helpful, and shockingly unpretentious. Our server (Peter, I believe) was especially proactive and gracious; a real delight. We left full, happy, and already planning our return. I don't have a single complaint. Perfect."
1255,"Underwhelming. I haven't left so disappointed from a Michelin starred meal. Sure, a few dishes stand out. The lamb was nice and unique, although a bit chewy for my liking. The scallops were really nice and flavorful too.Overall though, the food was mediocre. The presentation was sloppy at times. The bread we got felt stale. At all experiences, you can expect a problem or two, but there were far too many in this experience for my liking. The drinks are were also mediocre and the worst of all, the dessert was inedible for me. Definitely not two Michelin stars. Thanks, not coming back again."
1256,"The food here was good but was it worth $700? Absolutely not.I came here for an anniversary dinner at their ""terrace"" which is basically these individual tent-like cabanas on the sidewalk. While the ambiance was private and cute, the lights in these tents attracted a lot of mosquitos and I left with like 4 bites. We ordered the 3 course tasting with a wine pairing, and we also each got an extra drink at the beginning of the meal since our ""cabana"" wasn't ready and they let us go inside to get a drink at the bar. The food was all decent - I ordered the scallops for my appetizer, sea bass for my main and a mango dessert BUT the portions were tiny and I left still kinda hungry. My scallop appetizer literally only had 2 scallops that I ate in 4 bites. I also did not really think the wine pairing was worth $88 at all since it was 3 glasses and it's just a half pour each. You're basically paying $30 per half glass.The staff was very attentive and pleasant but I think they purposefully took their time in between courses. We got there at 8 and didn't leave until midnight. This would have been fine if we were inside but I was sitting outside getting eaten alive by the mosquitos."
1257,"My husband and I went here for my birthday. The ambience is old school classic so jackets are required. We ordered the three course with wine pairing. Each dish was delicious and paired very well with the wines. My favorite meal was the herb crusted veal, which was tender and full of flavor. But the mango dessert really took the prize for the night.The service was immaculate, and really made the meal extra special. My husband and I look forward to coming back."
1258,"Honestly incredible. We had the tasting menu with the wine pairing to go along with it for a romantic evening, and it was truly extraordinary. Every course was so delicate but bursting with flavor. The presentation was beautiful. The servers were top notch. The restaurant itself is beautiful. But it was the food that was so stand out. My boyfriend had been wanting to go here for years and was so happy with his experience also. So worth it."
1259,My bf and I celebrated our 4th anniversary at Daniel. Very elegant and decent place for a date night. We each had the 7-course tasting menu and each of the dishes was super creative and delicate. Our waiter also give us a desert for free after he hears that's our anniversary. Overall very pleasant experience dining at Daniels
1260,"Loved it!!! It was my first experience at Daniel. The food was great, service was impeccable and everyone was so friendly. I loved the scallops, beef and the strawberry dessert I ordered. I took a bite of all the food that my husband ordered (shrimp appetizer, veal and the rhubarb) and I loved those as well. I was so full at the end! The outdoor booths were also great. It didn't feel like we were eating on the streets. It was such a great first anniversary dinner experience. Thank you so much! Can't wait to be fully vaccinated and return for an indoor dining experience. :-)"
1261,"The atmosphere is beautiful, distinguished and the dishes are of French haute cuisine, the prices are high to the average and the service could be much better, I wish they had another option of better quality coffeeEl  ambiente es hermoso  distinguido y los platillos son de alta cocina Francesa, los precios son elevados al promedio y la atención podría ser mucho mejor, me gustaría que tuvieran otra opción de café de mejor calidad"
1262,My friend took me here for my birthday. The food was amazing. They gave us some free appetizers and bread. Everything is delicious. Cocktails are nice too. Didn't realize it's a Michelin 2 star restaurant until later on  too bad didn't get to take a picture with chef Daniel
1263,Best food at any Michelin starred restaurant in NYC. I'll take classic technique over a dozen fermented things anyday. Always a favorite
1264,"Daniel is an incredible restaurant. This was our third time dining here (we've been twice to the dining room and once for the a la carte outdoor dining).It is definitely a perfect spot for a special occasion. The food, service, and atmosphere are all top notch . They offer dining room and lounge seating. In the lounge you can order a la carte. The dining room offers a 4 course prix-fixe or tasting menu. We opted for the 4 course prix-fixe.Wild Scottish Pheasant - Definitely a strong Smokey/gamey flavor. It's mixed with a terrine foie gras so it's also a rather rich dish. Florida Frog Legs - Excellent. Was first time having frog legs and was pleasantly surprised how good they were.Ranch Beef Striploin - Everything about this steak was perfect. Highly recommend. Note it is for two and is an additional $20.Washington Apple Strudel - Very good.Some may worry that they won't be fool at a restaurant like Daniel, but the portions are generous. The bread service is excellent, most meals start with an amuse bouche, and multiple small desserts are included along with your main choice."
1265,"Takeout was disappointing. Paper containers sucked the moisture out of proteins and sauces. When scraping out sauces, the containers shredded. About half the sauces were absorbed into the containers. So much waste. Poor packaging. Everything under-seasoned. Out of three main-courses, only two accoutrements were excellent: the mushrooms on the beef stroganoff, and the beggars purse on the  roasted duck. Unimpressed."
1266,"The cabanas outside are very cute. The night was perfect for outside dining, but we reserved a table for 2 in the dining room. The wait staff were so polite and informative. We had to choose the 7 course prix fixed menu to get the best experience. The cocktails are delicious, I ordered both mocktails. The entire meal was emaculate, from taste to detail. Attractive and beautifully thought out, each dish celebrates harmoniously as the dishes get better and better. The scallop, sea bass, and prime rib were the most memorable. The avocado soup with the soft shell crab was also quite tasty. All in all it was an unforgettable experience. Recommend going all out. You only live once! Thank you again to everyone at Daniel, you made our dinner a night we will not forget. Merci beaucoup! S/O to the staff, yall made the whole experience. Will be back!"
1267,"I have kept a running tally of the best dinners I have had over my adult life. Until now a meal experience I had in portofino held the number one spot. That spot now belongs to Daniel, by far the best meal I ever had. I requested my reservation for my wifes bday well in advance and was so completely happy with the meal. Every bite was complete perfection and the wine was paired deliciously. The attention to detail from how each plate was arranged to the flavors and even the conversation with the staff far exceeded my expectations. I would like to thank Daniel for accommodating my wifes gluten allergy and express my most sincere appreciation to Mr. Guedouar. You made a special birthday marvelous. Sincerely Dr. Max"
1268,"I'm so sad about the decline of Daniel! This was once my favorite restaurant in New York. I went tonight for dinner and oh boy.... it was underwhelming. My sister is vegetarian but we decided to move forward with the prefix menus due to my confidence in the establishment. Surely they'll create 3 courses equal to the value of the $236 p/p (w/wine pairings) price tag! 1st course: 3 pieces of asparagus2n course: 6 pieces of artichoke and what looked like frozen peas and carrots3rd course: rhubarb and rice pudding - she sorta like it but it looked terrible.I had frois gras- was average but nothing special, lamb chop / potato & greens, desert was pre-made and obviously frozen pieces of a cake (not fresh).It was appalling! I inquired if Chef Daniel is even there and had they lost there Michelin star! I didn't get a straight answer on either question.I'm giving this 3 stars because the manager only charged me for the wine pairings, $200 (6 small glasses of wine). They listened and adjusted the bill which I appreciate. It's a very sad day for me as this was once a gastronomic explosion of flavors and fine dining cuisine. Sadly, it was on par with wedding reception food. It felt lazy at best"
1269,"Very past due review, but was able to grab a table on a walk a few months ago with a friend. It was right at the start of their outdoor dining phase and had their summer menu.We had some kind of melon soup with lobster medallions and a shrimp salad to start. The melon soup was quite interesting because it was sweet, yet savory. Very refreshing! My guest thought the shrimp salad was good but the highlight of the dish was not properly deveined. (""2 Stars""....)The entrees were also pretty decent. I had their signature dish of short ribs and (I think) Wagyu? with potatoes and asparagus. The meat was delish and the mash was so smooth and buttery. My guest had the halibut which was apparently also very tasty.We closed the night with a hazelnut bar and it was amazing. The richness of the mousse and chocolate was spot on. Overall, I was not really impressed by the quality of the food. The standards seem to be low for ""2 Stars"". I give a pass on service because it was at the start of their outdoor dining phase, but our server was very awkward. TLDR: Go if you need to cross off your Michelin list, but not worth returning to."
1270,The terrace is open and to dine alfresco here is special. To dine for Bastille Day is in this bastion of fine dining is spectacular. Of course diners are fixed with masks and shields but the essence exists with Daniel himself going table to table.Ate:Bastille day prix frixe $98 three courses with rose My bf ate beef duo.Ate:Bread and butter $9Niçoise salad Bouillabaisse I'll flotanteRoseThe star of the trio was dessert. The slivers of nectarines were perfection. The salad was also immense. The fish soup would have benefited from more seasoning.. Still the pleasure of this moment was intense in itself.
1271,"Daniel is a great place to eat on the Upper East Side.We came here for my husband's Birthday this week and overall I was impressed.Here are the pros:- Great Food - Friendly waitstaff - Elegant outdoor dining space - Drinks are fantastic Here are the cons:- If the host knows you and you are a returning customer you will be sat first (even if your reservations time comes up first)- Host is pretty arrogant - The proper utensils were not brought with each dish The host checked us in a few minutes early and asked us to wait around for our time to come up even though there were plenty of open tables; we watched as people who clearly knew the host were sat right as they arrived prior to their reservation; I had to question the host prior to us actually getting seated (this is the main reason for the minus one star).Once we were sat we were immediately asked for our drink order, I had a dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives, my husband had a martini with a lemon twist (both were made perfect).We started our meals with an appetizer; I had the beet salad, while the old ball and chain had the squash velouté (no spoon was brought with the dish), both dishes had so much flavor and plated beautifully. For our main course I had the Camargue and it was simply the best! The eggplant was cooked perfectly and the dish was all around perfection. My husband had the Flat Iron Steak and he said it was cooked just as he wanted it and he loved the blue cheese mashed potatoes which were off the charts great! (The only complaint here is no steak knife was provided, so we had to wait awhile for the server to return to ask for one).We ended our meal with the Andoa which is dark chocolate mousse with red currant jam; the dessert melts in your mouth! I highly recommend it. Daniel is a wonderful spot and if you are looking for a special night out you could not ask for a better place.We will definitely come back once the menu changes again.Thanks for making my husband's birthday special!"
1272,"The restaurant was beautiful and the service was excellent.  Staff was attentive and helpful.  The drinks were strong the food was good but it was not amazing, I did expect better.  The steak dish was just ok, not tender, no flavor.  The dishes  looked much better than they tasted.  They had ""mini couch"" for you to rest your handbag on."
1273,This place means a lot to me and is very special. The quality of food and service to match. Pure happiness. Nothing compares with the exception of @lasarte in Barcelona. Just go. This is NYC. Not the NYC that's been ravaged by the influence of the Midwest.
1274,"Daniel Has always been one of my favorite special occasion restaurants in New York with their truffle crusted doversole one of my all time favorite dishes. In the COVID era that have managed to maintain their impeccable standards with outdoor dining. They have the coziest private cabanas which both make you feel super safe abs allow you to stay warm even in January!We got the duck consomme, lobster salad, beef and veal stew. All were excellent! They do some pretty interesting wine pairings as well for example they paired the duck consommé with a Madeira which I never would have guessed in a million years but it worked! This time the staff were nice enough to give us a parting gift for our soon to be born baby!I will continue to come to Daniel for many more years to come!"
1275,I have been going to Daniel since 2002. The quality of the service has weakened throughout the years. Last night was a new one where the server made a novice mistake of switching our entrees.
1276,"I've eaten here several times over the years but my last visit was my first time back since Covid. Whereas before I would have said this was one of my top 3 restaurants of all time now I would say the food is relatively mediocre for fine dining. There's no single complaint really the service was excellent as usual however every dish I had as part of the tasting menu was just ok. At the price point there's just better options in NYC. I had a client dinner scheduled at Daniel in a few weeks however I just cancelled that. Maybe it was an off night, I'll go back at some point but I'm not in any rush."
1277,"We did COVID era takeout from Daniel and their ""Boulud Sur Mer"" menu was delicious. The Guinea Hen was really amazing. Crispy skin .. flavorful and mildly gamey, and actually a pretty good size portion. And the ""Albufera"" sauce it came with was so good I ended up googling it for a while. I really want another hen now. Maybe a couple. I can be that ""Guinea Hen Guy"" that comes by every day and orders three hens ... breakfast lunch dinner. The Pennsylvania Guinea Hen population would have problems.The Noisette dessert ... also so good. It's this lavender glistening log flecked with gold that is pulsating with flavor. The bergamot gelee tasted more like raspberry, but that didn't change how tasty it was. Definitely would get it again. The persimmon tart was also quite good, though in the taste bud cage match, the noisette got the close win.And let's not forget the duck consommé! Very tasty appetizer, with a cute black truffle slice swimming lazily in the consommé, unaware of it's imminent fate of being eaten. Pro tip: have water handy to pace yourself. Without it I would have inhaled the whole three course meal in a few minutes."
1278,"Pros- Amazing complementary passion fruit petit fours!!- Delicious bread and olive oil!!- Wonderfully cooked fish, they take care of their seafoodCons- The first half of my fish entree and first half of my chocolate entree were delicious! Second half was less enjoyable due to taste bud fatigue.Recs- Order different dishes with your +1 and share to address the con above.\- Ask your server for some passion fruit petit fours ;)"
1279,"I came here about a year ago and had an amazing experience- my first time at such a high caliber restaurant for the chef's tasting menu. The meal was outstanding and service was warm and friendly. Only complaints are a vein in one of my crayfish and every time they cleaned the bread crumbs off our table, the server brushed them right into my lap.This is obviously a place of extravagance, so opt for the tasting and wine pairing if you like that sort of thing- we had some great conversations with the sommelier (even though I am not so knowledgeable- but eager to learn). But prepare yourself for the check"
1280,"Since this restaurant is in the Tao group, I knew it has to be good. The ambiance is so unique in the inside. You first walk into a pawn shop and then it opens up to an elegant restaurant with such a chic ambiance. The service was helpful and really nice and also very quick. For drinks, I got the sun slip which was really good. For food, I tried the Korean style tacos with Chilean sea bass and they were amazing. For entrees, I tried the BBQ fries and the surf n turf. The BBQ fries were really good and addicting! The surf n turf was good and the meat was cooked nicely but there just wasn't that wow factor in the dish. Lastly, for dessert I tried the butterscotch ice cream with coconut whipped cream and I loved it! Such a unique dessert. Overall, I'm happy with my experience here and would recommend this restaurant to someone looking for a great ambiance and really cool dishes to try. Definitely dress up!"
1281,"Celebrated my sisters birthday here and it turned out to be a success! When you enter through the front there's a pawn shop where you can actually buy stuff which I thought was cool. We were pretty late for our reservation but they still accommodated our party and got seated pretty quickly. The ambience was very sophisticated and had a very New York City vibe to it. THE FOOD! The food was impeccable! I wasn't really expecting much quality in the food but I was sorely mistaken! We ordered multiple appetizers and drinks over and over again because it was that good. I got the steak cooked medium and it was perfection! The dessert wheel was so cool and delicious too! I'd come back here for the food alone! The only thing I didn't like is that it was very loud in there, I felt like we were having dinner at a club. If that bothers you then you should take that into consideration but other than that it's a great place to celebrate with drinks food and great company!"
1282,"Just meh. Three of us had the burger and it wasn't good. They also struggled to serve the right person the burger they ordered (eg no bacon  or cooked medium). Tacos, and Mac and cheese were just basic too. The Peruvian chicken was great. Three stars because the ambiance was nice and didn't feel rushed through dinner and drinks."
1283,"This is a really fun restaurant to go to for drinks or for dinner with friends. The food is good, not amazing. Overall it's still worth it for the vibe and experience.They have a pretty good cocktail list and a nice bar you can order from for drinks. We ordered several rounds and got some shots as well. For appetizers we tried the Thai style shrimp, which were delicious. We also tried the tortilla soup dumplings which were very unique and tasty. For entrees we tried the Thai Tuna, Salmon, Lamb Chops and Mac&Cheese. The salmon was our favorite -- it was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. The mac&cheese was also great. The lamb chops had good flavor but were over cooked and dry. The Thai tuna should really be an appetizer -- while it was tasty the portion size was very small compared to the other entrees. We capped off the meal with the vanilla dessert shots which were fun. Overall I would definitely go back for drinks and light meal."
1284,"Celebrating someone's birthday you'd expect the most extravagant experience and that's what we've had today.My sister in laws birthday was celebrated in the most memorable way possible. The waitress that was serving our table was extremely patient with us especially since we've already had some to drink. She kept coming by to check up on us and also take more drink orders. Food was amazing I couldn't stop sampling all the shareable and my steak was cooked to perfection (medium rare).She gave us some time to look through the menu and followed up to place the orders and honestly couldn't be anymore happier. The service here was absolutely amazing and couldn't be happier. Would absolutely recommended this restaurant to anyone and everyone, definitely need to give them a try and we enjoyed every bit of it of our stay."
1285,"What a fun and delightful place this was! We went on their first day of reopening brunch on our last day in the city. It was on our bucket list of must try restaurants recommended to us by a local.We were seated immediately. Love that it's hidden behind a pawn shop. The decor is beautiful and the staff plentiful. They recommend you get 4-5 small plates and share. I will say it is very expensive for the portions you are getting, but we were on vacation in NYC, so when In Rome....‍The tomato soup grilled cheese dumplings were my absolute favorite. The waiter was very amused because I cut them with my fork to try and make each bite last longer. My sister enjoyed the red velvet waffles. I also enjoyed the avocado toast! There were so many other things we wanted to try, but next time!!!"
1286,"What a cool spot!! Whether you live in NY or visiting (if you're visiting definitely add this to your list), this is one place you should have on your bucket list!From the front this restaurant is pawn shop (cool, right?). Everything in the pawn shop is up for grabs too $$.When you enter, the atmosphere/aesthetics are so cool. High ceilings, kind of like you're transported into another world.Our waitress was great and attentive. Menu had various options, all are designed to share which I love since I like to try a little of everything and not commit to one dish! We got the beef Wellington (amazing), Cacio e Pepe Mac n cheese (MUST GET) and the French dip sliders. Our drinks were amazing, my husband got one of their cocktails and I got my classic martini and they made it just how I like it.If you're looking for a date night, girlfriends night out - this is the spot!"
1287,"I've been here for dinner twice now, and both times were a great experience. Service was quick, friendly, and attentive on both occasions. We got a wide variety of drinks and everyone was pretty pleased with their choices.The menu seems a little eccentric on first glance, but everything we ordered tasted good. We had the grilled cheese dumplings (10/10, each person ended up with their own order), chicken arepas, broccoli, crispy miso eggplant, NY strip, chicken meatballs, and corn ravioli. They suggest sharing plates amongst the table, which we did for the appetizers and sides, but we each got our own entree. We got the donuts for dessert and those were delicious! Soft and warm and the dipping sauces complimented them well.It's easy to rack up a big bill here, but the atmosphere is fun, the interior is exquisite, and being under the TAO umbrella, that's not too surprising."
1288,"My friend wanted to try this place for her bday and honestly it was fantastic. The minute you walk in, it's an experience. The entrance is a pawn shop and then you walk through the door in the back of the pawn shop and walk into a beautiful restaurant. There were beautiful chandeliers everywhere with a large spiral staircase. Even the bathroom was extravagant with mirrors everywhere and a couch. The food itself was delicious. The cocktails were strong and sweet and all the food was seasoned to perfection. The poke tacos were crunchy and the sauce went so well with the tuna. The spaghetti with the egg on top was phenomenal, the egg was runny and the pasta had a nice kick to it. I highly recommend the Mac and cheese and their doughnuts were soft with the raspberry, caramel and chocolate dips. Although the prices are not cheap and the portion sizes are small, it was so worth it. Our waitress was lovely, she checked in on his constantly and gave great recommendations. Everything she recommended we enjoyed. I will definitely be returning!"
1289,"Was in the LES looking for places for brunch last minute and came upon this spot! I went with two other friends and we called for a last minute reservation over the phone literally 15 minutes before we arrived (pro tip: if they are not offering reservations online, call the restaurant and check). The atmosphere was unlike anything we expected, but in a good way. It was very vibey and cool inside - definitely a spot if you want to show up in a new, fun outfit. The restaurant inside is HUGE and can accommodate various party sizes. The food itself was really really good and everything you order is meant to be shared. Among 3 people, we ordered five dishes and it was perfect. Although we can for brunch and people normally order cocktails, we just had lattes, but the cocktails looked delicious. The damage on the bill was not at all as expensive as we thought it would be and our waitress (Chelsea) was super sweet and friendly. I would definitely come back again!"
1290,"OMG I LUV this place!  I don't want to ruin it but this is one of those hidden gems and you have to experience the whole thing in person.  This is an absolute romantic, group of friends, ladies night and anything else you wanted to call it place.  So much going on and the crowd is cool, as my son would say, it's a VIBE!  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, look for Michael I believe his name is.  He was an AMAZING  server/waiter.  Knows his food, drinks and portions.  The food is so amazingly good, flavorful, want to try everything.  I would suggest ordering many plates as we did just so that you could taste it all.  You won't leave unhappy.  We had little French dips, sirloin, Gruyère cheese, au jus., grilled cheese dumplings, the house salad (I could have eaten all of that easily), ribeye.  I feel like I left something out but that was more than enough food for two people.  When visitors come to town, show off this place!  Well done TAO Group!"
1291,"So much thought has been put into the details here. I tend to bring out of town guests here when I want to show off lol. You won't mind waiting to be seated while you look at the items in the shop. I like to observe my guests when they initially enter the restaurant and take in its splendor. The most frequent comment is it reminiscent of speakeasy in the 40s. I agree. What makes me feel as though I'm in a movie is the hip hop blasting through the system. Again, the details are what makes the experience. The bar cart in the bathroom. The bathroom itself. The entire ambiance. It is indeed a gastronomical experience as well. For me, it took having an open mind to some of the pairings. The bites are small and perfect for just that. It is indeed an evening you won't soon forget."
1292,"This place looks like a literal pawn shop when you walk in, but once you go through the door past security, you arrive in the beautiful entrance with a spiral staircase and stunning chandelier. The restaurant features a DJ, giving the place a nice vibe. My friends and I ordered multiple dishes to share, and all were good. The Mexican corn ravioli was the runaway favorite. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend."
1293,"We were very disappointed with pretty much everything. Made reservation on Tuesday for the Saturday night, arrived at the time but had to wait 40 (forty) minutes for our table!! Absolute nonsense.Don't let the yelp pictures full you, it is not as nice as it seems. Not luxury at all!Food was ok, 1 of 4 appetizers is ok, but nothing of it was 'wow'."
1294,"Ambiance: 5Food: 3 Service: 4 It's been over 5 years since I last came here, and let me tell you, I highly recommend for a girls night out on a Friday night! The place itself is sexy, majority of the guests were well dressed, and the music: AMAZING! Definitely a vibe. I arrived to my reservations super late, but was still seated without a problem and the hosts were all very pleasant. Our waitress, Chelsea, was super cool and provided great service. Now, the food.. to be honest, it was underwhelming-- I'll come back for only drinks and apps (and of course the atmosphere). Starters: we ordered the shrimps, which were okay and could've been hotter (in temperature). The fish tacos were actually really good and had a good kick to them (definitely recommend if you like spicy).Entrée: we ordered the lamb chops, which I thought were pretty good, though my friend found them to be too fatty. The Mac and cheese was ehh and so were the green beans.. I don't necessarily recommend those options. Dessert: we ordered the LES donuts which came with 3 different sauces: caramel, chocolate fudge, and raspberry. They were good, nice and warm, but nothing 'wow' about them. Overall, I'll be coming back for the great vibes and my delish espresso martini!"
1295,"I made reservations at this spot for a birthday dinner on Friday night. This is a beautiful venue that is appropriate for a special night out with your significant other. I would definitely recommend dressing up or you will stand out, & not in a good way..Our waitress, ""Haiza"", was great as she helped accommodate my request in surprising my girlfriend for her birthday. The food on their menu was designed to be shared, but we found the portions to be on the smaller side despite the high price they were charging. This may be something to consider for larger groups. But for us two, it was perfect as we were both full by the end with some left to take home.We both enjoyed our time here. But I would be hesitant to recommend this place for larger groups as the small portions & steep prices will make racking up a hefty bill very easy while leaving you less than satisfied. But if you are willing to spend some money to provide a special night for a date, then this place would get a thumbs up from me. TL;DRPros- Beautiful setting for special occasions. - Wait staff were attentive & pleasant. - Food was delicious & cooked perfectly. Cons- Although their food was meant to be shared, we felt the portion sizes for some dishes did not reflect this concept appropriately"
1296,"I've been here a couple times now. I think it's one of those places you go to occasionally to celebrate. The experience is really nice - The decor is beautiful, there's a lady in the restroom that passes out towels, there's complementary things like perfume and matches. The food is extremely small portioned. It's tapas style so you need to order a lot of plates and that adds up. I recommend the bone marrow and the surf and turf. Everything was delicious but definitely paid a pretty penny"
1297,"Really cool restaurant, the outside is a fake pawn shop which makes for a cool entrance. The food is mostly appetizer portions meant to be shares, a la American tapas. Overall the cocktail program is great and I always order the Grilled Cheese Dumplings, it's like deconstructed tomato soup."
1298,"So I've been meaning to try this place for years but it was always off of a whim and weren't able to get reservations for dinner. So my husband and I finally were able to dine there Friday. Made reservations that morning for a 10pm table. Weren't able to get anything earlier. Now the ambiance and decor, beautiful. Vibes were very energetic. Felt like the city prior 2020. Great music. Food was tasty. Not a vast menu though. Reasonably priced. Definitely a must try and a go to for great weekend & fun vibes."
1299,"I wish I could give Beauty & Essex more than 5 stars! My group of 14 friends celebrated NYE (the early dinner seating) and we couldn't have been more impressed. First of all, Tania, has very accommodating when we were planning our dinner! We were able to reserve the private room which was outstanding. The service was very impressive. We went in thinking the service might be slow but Lacie, our main server, was extremely attentive and made sure our glasses were always full and were never left waiting. I will definitely be back and can't wait to host another event at Beauty and Essex!!"
1300,"The food was decent, but people are definitely at Beauty & Essex for the vibes. I feel like my experience was tainted by bad guests, but I would definitely give this place a second chance!"
1301,"I love this place. The whole ambiance is amazing, the only reason why I wouldn't give 5 star is because of the loud music. Otherwise the service, drinks and food were amazing."
1302,"I have wanted to visit Beauty & Essex for a long time and never had the chance but I am glad I made the chance for my birthday this year. I had a wonderful time celebrating here with my family. Everyone who works here was absolutely kind and happy to accommodate any needs we had. The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous, the entire vibe is what I wish my house looked like. I spent quite a bit of time taking photos in here because of how stunning it was. Hot tip: the women's bathroom is gorgeous and excellent for photo sessions. I am not a big drinker but I really enjoyed the Beauty Elixir that has gin, cucumber, strawberry, and sparkling rosé in it. It was very subtle and a great accompaniment to dinner. The food was good as well, not as fantastic as Tao, their sister restaurant, but still enjoyable. My favorite dish were the Cauliflower Tacos; they were bursting with flavor and I regret not ordering another plate of them. Everyone I was with was happy with their dishes but the real star to me was the Wonder Wheel dessert ferris wheel. I would suggest getting it even if you aren't here celebrating anything. I had a wonderful time and by some miracle of time and space got a parking spot right out front. They even gave me a complimentary birthday cupcake which was tasty and very kind. I would definitely go back to try some more dishes and get another Beauty Elixir!"
1303,"Fine dining with character! Beauty & Essex was our choice for an upper echelon dinner to end our NY trip. There is a speak easy vibe to the place with the ambiance of a popular sultry lounge. Come dressed to impress and a decent food budget!We made reservations (as should you) and were seated quickly. We got 2 cocktails and decided to eat light so we ordered cauliflower tacos and the Mac and cheese to snack on since we weren't very hungry. The tacos were light in deed, but good and the Mac and cheese was..peppery? No complaints, but I'd like to try more of the menu to see if this place is truly worth the price and hype. Service was good, but not memorable or personable. I may return for brunch since that's what most people recommend.Sum it all up :Get all grown and sexy for a table here Date night, celebration or night out with friendsReserve for a quick wait and be sure for a timely arrival"
1304,"The decor and vibes in the place are great, would recommend to those looking for a photo opp or unique birthday experience. However, the food was just ok, and their specialty is the tomato soup dumplings but they weren't hot. All the food comes in shareable bite size portions."
1305,"This place has great ambience and a scene to be seen. It's beautiful, plush decor, and dark inside with a separate bar room from the main dining room, and there may have been multiple rooms. The food is contemporary and delicious. Highly recommend the French dip toasts, cheese tomato soup dumplings (served in small spoons), corn ravioli, chicken meatballs with whipped ricotta...the drinks were delicious too. It's a fun, hip dining experience with friends. Definitely a place for sharing several things with a small or large group to take advantage of what the menu has to offer. We ended with some homemade donut holes that were delicious with a chocolate, caramel, and raspberry sauce."
1306,"Usually these popular restaurants in the city are overrated and don't meet the expectations of their pricing & exclusivity but Beauty & Essex definitely does! The atmosphere is very intimate even during the day, dark enough for the ambiance yet bright enough that you don't feel like you can't see who you're speaking to. The food is really good and they have such a unique menu from their craft cocktails to the extravagant pastry Ferris wheel! The presentation is absolutely phenomenal. They also offer a great deal for brunch on Sunday. $49pp for a bottle of cava rose along with multiple options of starters, entrees and even dessert which includes their yummy Oreo pancakes. These pancakes are to die for!!! Dress to impress as this is a great place for a photo op and come with an appetite!"
1307,"Came back with a friend and LOVED every part of it! Food was fantastic, staff was friendly and food came out quick. The bone marrow, and eggplant, the ""soup dumplings"" and the basil gelato were my favorites! Can't wait to go back for it!"
1308,"Interesting atmosphere. You enter a pawnshop and take the rear door to the restaurant... speakeasy like... dim lighting 20s vibe... I guess is the best way to explain it. Food doesn't disappoint. We were a party of 4 which means we can order different dishes to share. I highly recommend this option.Shout out to our waiter Cameron. Great service my man!!! Keep it up, you'll do well in life."
1309,"The environment and ambiance of this place is rad! The food was good-but super spendy! We shared four dishes-the chicken meatballs, empanadas, focaccia pizza, and the prime rib sliders. The favorite were the sliders with the au jus dipping sauce-freaking delicious. For dessert we got the wonderwheel-which was pretty good and the chocolate cake-Devine. Check it out if you are in Vegas, just be prepared to spend some cash. The service here was absolutely top notch as well."
1310,"It was my first time at Beauty & Essex and you go through a door in a jewellery shop and enter into an expansive dining room. All the cocktails at the bar were great! Food was tapas style so we ordered a bunch of plates to share. Some of my favorites were the citrus green beans and spicy salmon tartare. We also got both types of soup dumplings - while they lacked Asian flavours, they were still delicious! I definitely recommend saving space for dessert. The double chocolate cookie was amazing but my favorite thing was the Ferris wheel of desserts, including white chocolates, mini donuts, mini brownies, and more! Bonus: the bathrooms are beautifully decorated :)"
1311,I visited this place for my Birthday. The ambiance is so beautiful and relaxed. It was definitely a chill vibe. The food was also pretty good. We got there a little later than our reservation and had about 15 minutes to order so we had to rush a little to order but the waitress was great.
1312,"My friends and I were lucky enough to snag a reservation at Beauty & Essex shortly after it finally reopened last week.Perhaps one of the better known speakeasies in the city, the indulgent bar and lounge is tucked behind the unassuming storefront of a higher end pawn shop (where everything is actually for sale!). The only tipoff is a serious bouncer that's always stationed outside.The bar inside opens up to high glass ceilings and opulent chandeliers. Not sure if it's because of the COVID restricted seating, but each table felt sectioned off and private.We came for the cocktails, which were artistically crafted and generous with the spirits. Between our party of six, I think we tried each drink on the menu - the Pink Panther, The Merchant and Green with Envy were consensus favorites.Can't comment too much on their food offerings except the grilled cheese dumplings, which I highly recommend. Really didn't know what to expect, but a spoon sized bite of grilled cheese soaked in tomato soup is a genius reimagining of one of my favorite comfort foods.As a part of Tao Group, Beauty & Essex delivers in elegance and its party ambience - great for fancy parties or an upscale date night out."
1313,We had a great time.  Everything was perfect.  The food was amazing. We had a group of six people and everyone loved the food.  The service was very good and the ambiance was excellent.  We will definitely go back. Even the bathroom was worth a visit.
1314,"I came here for my birthday day with my friends and had high hopes! Let's just say, they were met exactly how I expected. Everyone was very yummy, my all time favorite picks were the Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos, a little French dips( after trying the first round we had to order more because they were so goood!) and Soup dumplings. You have to come with a group so you can try a little bit if everything! The Tortilla soup Dumplings were my favorite out of the two dumpling options. And if you're feeling crazy, get the Onion rings on the side, they were really yummy. We ordered just about everything on the menue and nothing disappointed. ALSO, every drink we had was 10/10, absolutely yummy and packed with a punch! Definitely come with a group and taste everything!"
1315,"Food lives up to the hype. NO CAP!The grilled cheese tomato soup dumpling situation might've been the best thing I've ever tasted. And a sister knows what's good, just saying"
1316,"Phenomenal food and great service! The storefront had cool jewelry and accessories available for purchase. Atmosphere was loud, but not so much that it was unenjoyable. 10/10 experience - they even gave me a free cupcake for my birthday."
1317,"Beware! Ate here a couple nights ago with a friend and we both got very sick afterwards. It's the only meal we had in common so obviously something we ate here got us sick. I've never experienced anything like this before. Proceed with caution.Just did a search here on yelp and they have a history of people getting sick after eating there, according to reviews over the years. Wish I had seen them beforehand. So disgusted."
1318,"Excellent! If I could give 10 stars I would! Amazing experience! An it is really an experience. They asked me if it was my first time at the entrance. The staff was very friendly, helpful . The food was delicious the drinks and the selection of wines . I came here for dinner, we celebrated my husband's birthday and everyone was very nice!Restrooms are impressive. The atmosphere and ambiance is unique ."
1319,I came here with my wife and her friend for dinner.   We were very satisfied with all of our food.  Excellent cocktails with a good amount of liquor.   We shared 4 dishes and 2 deserts.  We all said every dish was wonderful!    Definitely will come back again
1320,"Really good quick eats, if you are in the mood for falafel, lamb, or chicken pita sandwich for a reasonable price. Yes for under $10 you get a decent size sandwich plus for an additional $3 a good dessert, look no further guys. I had the chicken sandwich on a pita with falafel and salad. My husband had the lamb sandwich. Both were very good & the baklava was very good too at about $3 a slice um what are you waiting for? It is a fast casual spot, no waiter service, cheap eats, indoor and outdoor dining. Great staff. Located on Saint Marks PL. near everyone on the busy street. Go give it a try."
1321,"Ok seriously this falafel is next level. I've had falafel before but never THIS good. I ordered the meat combo to split with others and it was plenty of food for three people. The meat plate came with meat, hummus, baba ganoush, falafel, 2 pitas and salad. We added rice for $1 and also had grape leaves and pickle salad on the side too. Plenty of food for 3 people. Ordering was super easy and the line moved really fast. Service was great and provided extra sauces and utensils we needed to share. I will definitely be dreaming about the falafel."
1322,Food was delicious but my rating is low because of the attitude of the man who took my order. He was extremely curt and also charged me too much for the falafel sandwiches I ordered. He rushed me through so quickly I didn't even realize until I'd left. It's a shame the good food left a bad taste.
1323,"This is a NYC staple!!! It was a dreary night in the city and the West Village was overflowing with people. I had a hard time getting a cab around 11pm, so i walked about twenty minutes. I was craving a and only Mamoun's would suffice. Hadn't been there in years and the food didn't disappoint. Tasted just as amazing as i recalled it would. They're conveniently located around the corner from the West 4th Street Station; A-F and M trains. So many iconic places are in there immediate area; the Courts at West 4th, The Blue Note and The Comedy Cellar to name a few. If you have one day in the city or are planning on taking a trip to NY, do yourself a favor and stop by Mamoun's. You will not regret it!!!"
1324,"When in New York City, didja ever crave something that's cheap New York eats and will also fill your belly? A Hot Dog on the corner? Eww, heck no. I'm craving simple, hold in one hand lunch that's easy on the wallet.I'm heading to Mamoun's Falafel.Mamoun's has been banging out their signature Falafel for over 50 years. Honestly, as an Italian kid from Brooklyn, I never heard of Falafel until I came back from the military and my girlfriend (now my wife) introduced me to these wonderful fried treats. I must add, Mamoun's is the oldest Falafel restaurants in New York City.Mamoun's Falafel isn't a typical Falafel ball. When you crack open the Falafel, you'll see the inside is emerald green. That's because Mamoun's kicks it up a notch using the finest imported spices. It's a fresh, all natural and authentic Middle Eastern cuisine being served. Mamoun's got you! I noticed there was no line as a zipped inside. I ordered a can of Coke and a regular Falafel Sandwich. I'm not sitting down to dine, I'm on the go baby!The regular Falafel Sandwich is a monster. Packed with flavor, it's the ultimate on the go healthy fast food.Sure, there are other guys out there, competition is healthy. When I want a kicked up funky Falafel? Mamoun's Falafel all day!"
1325,Sheeeesh Mamoun's! I've heard good things about the falafel here but after going I realized that this is most likely some of the best falafel I might ever have in NYC! You absolutely must come here and order the falafel over rice or falafel salad (with pita) and understand the deliciousness that is Mamoun's. I can't wait to come back with all of my cash (not credit or debit) and buy 12 sides of this falafel.
1326,"Always my first stop for food whenever I come to New York. My name is there wasn't a line when I went this time, which was nice.Although it wasn't crowded, it definitely is a small space so not easy to social distance 6 ft apart. So just be sure to wear your mask(s) and sanitize your hands. They don't ask to see the vaccination card. As soon as I walk in, I have tunnel vision and just order two shawarmas, 1 for now, 1 to go. The prices have gone up...I remember when it was just ~$5! Anyway, I checked their website before coming ( just to make sure they are open and to see if they have any restrictions) and saw they sold their insane hot sauce for $6!! Of course I had to buy one.Still cash only."
1327,The Schwarma is where it's at. No wonder ppl return here and it's open til 4am. And no wonder there r many locations bc the grilled meat is fire.
1328,"My Lebanese husband loved his falafel sandwich, so that's always a ringing endorsement. The extra parsley in their falafel makes it so tangy and special. The sandwich is a good size and very reasonably priced. They really stuff ingredients in, you're not getting any empty space in the pita. Highly recommend, will come back!"
1329,"I've been grabbing falafel at Mahmoun's since I was a kid (quite frequently in high school and college), and my mom fondly remembers their falafel from her college days at NYU in the early 80's. Sure, I remember their falafel sandwich being $2.50, and it's now $5, but it's still the best bang for your buck in Manhattan. Add babaganoush for an extra $1.50 for some creamy, smoky eggplant goodness with your falafel. In the winter, don't sleep on the lentil soup ($3.50). Bring your pita of goodness to Washington Square Park and have yourself a classic NYC moment."
1330,"Mamoun's is a staple not just of St. Mark's Place, but the entire East Village/Greenwhich. As someone of middle eastern descent I always am looking for a chicken shawarma/kebab sandwich. Luckily I live close enough to Mamoun's! It's healthy, filling, and delicious. The hot sauce is my favorite but be warned: it is very spicy. Not your Tabasco spicy, like actually can make you work up some tears if you put a lot on your meal. I do anyway because i loveee it. I got the bleecker which was chicken & falafel in a sandwich."
1331,Very good! Cheap eats with decent outdoor seating or grab and go. Just make sure and bring cash.
1332,"Came here on a hot summer day recently. It was so hot and we were sweating, oh boy, I wish they had outdoor fan to cool us down little bit.This place is a whole in the wall, there is no indoor seating, but they make delicious food. I had the plater which is combination of falafel, taboulé, baba ghanoush and shawarma recommended by a friend, it was good."
1333,"Somehow hadn't reviewed this place despite coming here for over a decade. Small outpost with a concise and cheap menu of falafels, shawarma, and other middle eastern favorites.Most recently, ordered the Falafel Plate ($8) - a large container with six large falafel balls, pita, rice, greens, tomatoes, and yogurt/hot sauces. Falafels are always well seasoned and not dry, especially when paired with the yogurt sauce. Rice is cooked perfectly; best eaten when mixing with the veggies. Personally, like the Shawarma Sandwich ($7) the best - overflowing with meat and you can add your own sauces to get the balance right (red sauce is not to be messed with).Prices have gone up over the years, but the flavor hasn't changed. They now have a larger outdoor seating setup since the pandemic, and back to the late hours that made it so convenient."
1334,"We were able to try out Mamoun's Falafel through Uber Eats. We ordered the Shawarma plate, Bleeker sandwich, and fries. Everything was warm and delicious. The food was packed with flavor! 5/5 Amazing food! Definitely a must-try. Not sure what the dining situation is as we've never been to the restaurant, but don't miss if you're in the area!"
1335,Falafel here is good. I mean soft and delicious falafel is a must try if you are in the area in NYC. It's a good value.
1336,"$5 dollar sandwiches and under $10 plates - falafel is the real deal; crispy on the outside tender on the inside. Hot sauce is actually spicy. I don't need to say more - gem on St Marks, go get it!"
1337,"I have lived in New York for the last couple of years and this place has always been my go to place. I've taken every person visiting the city to have the 'best falafels and hummus' ever. I LOVE the falafel sandwich and hummus sandwich are my all time favourites. They are HUGE, flavourful, so tasty and filling and absolutely worth the $5. The hummus is honestly one of the best ones I've ever had. If you're looking to go here, couple of points to remember - they only take cash, there isn't really much 'seating' - it's more of the grab and go places. You can carry the food and sit in Washington square park to eat (which is a what everyone does) and the line to enter is a bit long but usually moves quickly. And also don't forget to ask for the spicy sauce - it's the perfect add on to the sandwich but also beware, it's super spicy!"
1338,Falafel is amazing. Best in Manhattan for sure. Great flavor for an affordable price!
1339,"10000000/10 would recommend!! Service is as great as expected! Guy at the front was so nice. He noticed I was 3rab and told the guy in the back to make sure he makes my falafel sandwich perfect, love that Arab hospitality lol Price is UNbeatable in New York, or anywhere really! I took my sandwich to Washington square park because it was a short walk away. It only took one bite and nostalgia hit me. The falafel tastes just like back home, just like how my family makes it! So so good! I hate when falafel sandwiches are dry, but this one was not, plenty of tahini! Not everyone puts lettuce with falafel, but I personally love/prefer it that way. The sandwich was also surprisingly filling even though I was super hungry."
1340,My boyfriend and I came here for our 2 year anniversary dinner and had a wonderful experience. The food was delicious and our server Akin was great! We've been here a few times and we'll definitely be back!
1341,I loved the food and the ambiance. It was yum. My server Akin was a pleasure and his recommendations were top notch! Can't wait to come back!
1342,Amazing service and the food was great! Eric and Stefan made my friend feel so special on her birthday!
1343,"Dined in for NYE and it was a lovely treat. We ordered:- Escargot- (Seasonal) Cheese with berry compote- Mushroom Ravioli - Steak Frites Drinks:- Mayan PunchSo, let's start with the food because food is king. The escargot was delicious. Home run, a must get. While it is fun to take the meat out of the shells, I really found it convenient that these were out and ready to party. The seasonal cheese/compote was rich and delicious. You just can't go wrong with bread, cheese and spread. I loved this bite as far as it being a holiday special. It screams winter to me, loved it. The mushroom ravioli was the only thing I wasn't crazy about, but looking back I think this was my error and not the dish itself. It was very flavorful but it is VERY mushroom forward/heavy. I mean it is stuffed, slathered and covered in mushrooms. I read ""truffle"" and thought maybe this would be a balanced mushroom truffle flavor however this was light on the truffle (I didn't even know that was a thing.) If you love the fungi, I'd recommend. If not, pick something else. The steak was delicious. It was cooked and seasoned to perfection. The service was good. It was very busy during NYE but I still feel like we were well taken care of. The space itself is gorgeous. It feels refined and airy. It is a classic. Highly recommend dinning here during the holidays as they had a huge, gorgeous tree in the middle of the restaurant. Overall, a lovely meal and a wonderful experience. 4.7/5"
1344,"I've been popping into their bar for years--perfect for those times you need a layover bev before plans in the village, or to settle in for the main event and have a meal... either way, the service and scene is pleasingly consistent and lovely at their flagship NYC location  Last night, had the pleasure of hanging with Michelle as she served us a few rounds of perfect drinks, while we snacked on some mussels (which were perfect and plentiful). From the ideal balance of brine in my extra dirty martinis to the no-nonsense, no-sugar espresso martinis, Michelle's drinks did not disappoint! She surprised us with some ""chocolate cake shots"" at the end, which mysteriously tasted exactly as advertised... great way to end the evening Looking forward to many future returns, of course."
1345,"This place look soo good , the service is amazing , Hector help me decide my drinks ! Very good good and quality"
1346,"Came in to celebrate Pre-Valentine's day with the Hubs but we arrived earlier than our reserved time. We were glad we were able to be accommodated and our table was actually ready!My request to be seated where we can see the interior setup was granted as well and we had a nice view of the pretty much everything including the bar. We were attended to by Eric and he was delightful. Friendly but professional. We started off with the escargot which was cooked perfect. Nice texture, not too chewy and sauce was not overpowering. They didnt come with the shell though; wouldve been fun taking them out myself lol but nevertheless, a very good app. Steak was good as well but I may have had better. However, it was one of the items we were eyeing and we were still satisfied. Oh the PJ breeze was perfect and a refreshing drink (non-alcoholic) ! Chardonnay was great too. We enjoyed everything.Lastly, ambience was beautiful and just what we needed/wanted for this occasion. I love their outdoor seating as well and I'm happy to know that that area is dog-friendly. Would definitely recommend this place!"
1347,"The Quick: Beautiful interior, great food, a bit of a scene while still being comfortable. Reasonable wine and bubble prices (cocktails are a bit pricey). Great spot to take out of town guests The Details: We love this place! It's so beautiful especially around the holidays (check out my photo of the massive decorated Christmas tree!) The vibe is great, the staff is attentive,they take reservations and they have vegan options ... So many things to love! Their french fries are 10/10 delicious - paired with the sparkling rosè you have the meal of champions! The summer outdoor people watching is incredible as well. We are fans and will continue to visit ... Especially when we have our of town guests and want to show them an awesome spot in the best neighborhood in Manhattan. The Damage: I had two drinks and an proper entree (plus two helpings of delicious complementary french baguette... Sorry not sorry) for $50 pre tip. For Manhattan, that's super reasonable"
1348,"My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate our anniversary and we were not disappointed. We ordered the french onion soup, steak tartare and the Faux-Filet Bercy (18 oz dry aged NY strip steak) to share. Our waiter was extremely helpful and knowledgeable of the menu. French onion soup was DELICIOUS and hit the spot. It was a pretty decently sized bowl with a ton of melted cheese on top. Steak tartare was interesting since it was our first time trying raw steak. They give the tartare with a quail egg to mix in and bread on the side. Good flavors but not sure if I would get it again, since I couldn't get over the idea of eating raw steak. For the main dish, we really enjoyed the dry aged steak (medium rare). We were deciding between the Steak Frites and the Faux Filet, but I'm SO glad we went with the faux-filet and tried something new. Although it didn't come with fries, the steak was phenomenal. We asked for garlic butter to put on top and a literal DREAM so make sure to ask for this. We were quite full by the end of our meal. Overall, 10/10 experience. Tip: We sat on the second floor which overlooked the entire restaurant. It was a lot more intimate and I would recommend sitting up there if possible."
1349,"For cocktail, Avion Sour is good.For dishes, the mushroom ravioli is sooo recommended, sea bass is good to, sautéed vege is delicious. I like the Ribeye too."
1350,"Came here last week and had a lovely time. This spot is bustling, but despite all the buzz the staff was very attentive and kind enough to seat us almost immediately without a reservation.Because this is a French spot we opted for the pate and the steak. I highly recommend getting either or both. A surprise dish that I really enjoyed here was the ratatouille, a perfect winter snack. Their staff is very knowledgeable on wine pairings so just ask them, but we did a crisp white."
1351,"A sunny, cold winter day brought us to the West Village for a nice brunch at Boucherie. Tbh, we only checked it out after seeing it on And Just Like That... but don't judge! The inside decor was lovely as expected. The outdoor seating was well conceived and decently heated. It was uncrowded in the early afternoon (and winter), but the tables were a very tight squeeze. If crowded, you could feel like you are sitting on the lap of your neighbor.Food and drink were above average. The soupe a l'oignon was excellent, especially on a chilly day. The fruit plate was sizable, colorful, and fresh with a drip of honey. The pain au chocolat was also tasty. The croque madame was just okay. It was very bready and a bit dry. A better version is found elsewhere in Manhattan at Bouchon. My Bloody Mary was very tangy and horseradish forward. All are on the pricey side of the brunch spectrum, but typical for the city and the moment.Why only four stars? We had hoped for a better croque madame as a centerpiece of a great French brunch. But it is mostly about service, which was inattentive, even in an unbusy time. It started strongly but then disappeared. We might have ordered more drinks or coffee, but there was no repeat visit. I ended up having to go to the host stand to request our check. Not a deal breaker, but for an upscale dining experience, I expected more thoughtful service."
1352,"Exceptional food (as usual), but we had a terrible dining experience next to a table with a very large and unruly dog that kept jumping on our table!  Not sure why the restaurant would allow such a large dog in a small dining area.  Not great for a $500 dinner..."
1353,"While walking to the subway, my fiance and I stopped in our tracks outside Boucherie because it was just so beautifully decorated for Christmas. It looked absolutely lovely, and we decided right then and there that we needed to come back here for a meal. I don't know if I've ever before made a reservation for a restaurant based SOLELY on their decor, and without looking at their reviews (or prices!) at all... but I suppose there's a first time for everything!We came here for brunch, and only after making that reservation did we see the prices. This was a bit more than we were anticipating, but we were on vacation after all. Thank goodness we came -- because this was worth every penny.I ordered the french onion soup while my fiance chose the steak sandwich, and we opted to split the Pomme de Automne signature cocktail. The drink was strong and flavorful, and the apple puree really elevated it. We both very much enjoyed it. At $19, this was definitely a sipping drink, but it was sure tasty.The onion soup was delicious, with a bit of a sweeter broth (reminiscent of a Vidalia onion, perhaps) and plenty of gruyere cheese on top. But the piece de resistance was that steak sandwich. As soon as I took one bite, I instantly questioned my life choices (mainly, why did I not order this myself?!). My wonderful fiance, seeing the look of deep regret on my face, sweetly suggested we just share our meals. He gave me half of his sandwich and I gave him (more than) half of my soup. It's been a month since our trip and we are both still talking about that sandwich. Absolutely one of the best I've ever had.We strongly considered dessert but we were actually pretty full from what we had ordered. I kind-of wish we had ordered something sweet though, if only because the rest of our meal was so great, I'm quite sure they would have made an excellent dessert as well.New York obviously has plenty of incredible restaurants. On this trip, this was hands down the best meal we had. I can't wait to return."
1354,"Great atmosphere, great friends, authentic cuisine Française, what a perfect dinner celebration!The cocktails are spot on. La soupe À L'oignon c'est superbe !! The staff is swift. The bistro is a bustling festive gem! Wishing you all a Merry Merry Happy Happy Holiday season!!Cheers! Cin cin! Prost! Bonne santé! Merci beaucoup!**dogs are allowed in the outdoor dining area. So French and lovely**"
1355,"I've heard many good things about the Boucherie restaurants but I was disappointed when I finally had the chance to go. We were also seated by the door on a cold night so eating indoor with our jackets on added negatively to the experience. Each time the waiters went out to tend to the outdoor dinners we were blasted with the cold air and no ones hair withstood the blows. We also had to sit and watch while two couples at different tables argued in the outdoor eating with each other throughout the night. NY being NY, there was also an incident with a random passerby throwing a glass from a table.The restaurant was packed that night and our table on the end had very slow service. From seating to glasses of water and menus, it took 20 minutes. The food came out quickly after we ordered but everything was very lacking in seasoning. The escargot was soft but felt like it was just sitting in oil with no salt or butter. The frog legs were oily, bland, and very chewy. I was conflicted between asking the waiter for salt and just eating to get out of there as fast as possible. Our steak was cooked to the right temperature, but again even with the sauces it was bland. My sister had gotten the ravioli at the union Square location and raved about them  since but she said the ravioli from this location was not comparable. The only dishes that were redeemable were the ratatouille and the wagyu burger.Overall the experience was not a pleasant one. Perhaps it was due to it being a busy night but it will be awhile before I think about going back. Although aesthetically the restaurant is beautifully decorated."
1356,"This definitely is my new favorite French brasserie! Located right in the heart of West Village. To describe this space in three words- cute, warm, and lovely. A great date spot or for a friends gathering, especially during Christmas, since they have a beautifully decorated Christmas tree located right in the center on the restaurant. They have a long bar where you can wait till your party arrives or have a meal there as the bartender seemed pretty friendly. Here is what I tried:Entreé-the proper French word for what we know as appetizer-Steak Tartar- this was hands down the star dish 10/10 Plat Principal-Main Course-Salmon- very good 9/10-Mussels- very good 8/10-SteakDessert-Creme Brûlée 10/10Vin-Wine:-Rose 9/10-Sauvignon Blanc 8/10-La Vie En Rose- verrry pretty 8/10-Dirty martini 9/10Best area to be seated- the Mezzanine- since you'll be able to have the best view of the restaurant. Overall experience is a 8.5/10. The staff was friendly, most of the food was really good, and the wine paired very well with the dishes. The ambiance is nice and lively.Would I recommend? Absolutely! I'd say this is a nice spot to go to even by yourself. You can enjoy a bit of people watching over a nice meal and a glass of wine."
1357,"This is just one of a couple of Boucherie restaurants in Manhattan. I would still say that Petite Boucherie down the street near Gay Street was my more favored location compared to this West Village location. This location is good but I feel like I had a better experience down the road. This restaurant is large and very lively right in the heart of West Village. Its interior is fancy like that of what you expect in a typical big city. I went during the holiday season so there's a huge Christmas tree right at the center of the main dining room. The bar was full and the dining room(s) were nicely occupied and from my vantage point, I saw that the kitchens were constantly churning out food. Now onto the food itself. I ordered the pork chop and my gf ordered the red wine chicken. Presentation was ok but could have been a tiny bit better for a french restaurant. It kinda looked slapped together and reminded me of homestyle food. The pork chop was cooked perfectly and everything was good until the next few bites. The sauce ended up being very salty in both of our dishes and eventually we ended up drinking lots of water to compensate. We couldn't finish the potatoes that came with the dish cause of how soaked in salty sauce they were in. The entrees were pricey at almost $40 a piece and the cocktails themselves were $19 too. The creme brûlée dessert was decent but definitely more runny than normal and probably the least best we've tasted. The bill was pricey for the quality that we got but overall it was not disastrous. It just left us feeling like we should have gone to a different Boucherie restaurant instead."
1358,"Best steak I've ever eaten! Came here with a bachelorette party of 8 and were given a big table where we got comfortably. I would definitely make a reservation though, as the place was PACKED. Our waitress was really great and helped us order as we had never been there before. Next time I would order wine but I got the la vie en rose and it was very good. Me and three other of my friends split the porterhouse steak and as sides got the ratatouille, potatoes au gratin, and French fires. The steak was cooked perfectly and came with 3 sauces, I used the bernaise sauce which was delicious.  For an appetizer, we had the steak tar tar which has a great texture and consistency. No room left for dessert but I'll def be back for a date night!"
1359,"What a beautiful restaurant!My wife was getting her doo done at Arrojo, afterwards we had reservations for the French bistro Boucherie. Walking inside, its a shock to the senses. There's a beautiful long bar, every table on the main floor had customers so we had to step up to the next level overlooking the restaurant. As we walk by the kitchen, the wait staff are hustling out plates, Boucherie feels alive with excitement!While we're waiting for our table, I order drinks. I ordered an Old Fashioned and I ordered for my wife the Provence Martini. Made with lavender and lemon, this was a very ooh la la drink.We're in a brunchy mood but how can you pass on the Boucherie's French Onion soup? This French Onion soup was probably the best I ever had. Very rich and flavorful and topped with the sharp Gruyere cheese all bubbly.. mmmm...I ordered a Le Croque Madame that was equally outrageous. The Jambon ham, Gruyere cheese and bechemel all slathered on sourdough bread? Then topped with an egg?! Dang son, it just went full French up in here!We loved the West Village Boucherie restaurant, our next Boucherie? Mid town. We totally enjoyed our dining experience at the West Village Boucherie."
1360,"It was beautiful waking in but ugly when the meal concluded. We were quickly seated upon entering and our drinks orders were taken and served. After which the waiter disappeared for 15 mins. When he did return he took the orders of 3 other tables that were seated after us. I was disappointed to say the least. Not only that after he took their orders he disappeared again to return 5 mins later at which point we had to flag him to get his attention. It was so bad during this period that I was looking on Resy to book another restaurant. Alas, we did ordered and the entrees did arrived. The Boucherie burger was good. The patty was medium rare as ordered and the frites were crispy. The Boeuf was dry and flavorless. It was in every sense of the word, mediocre. But I suppose it did fill the stomach. At the tail end, we had to wait an additional 10 mins after request just to get the check. The waiter did not once apologize for the poor service or lack thereof, which would at least made things a little better. And I still tipped good. Sometimes I feel I am too kind to put up with this."
1361,"My boyfriend and I ate here for his birthday dinner, and it did not disappoint! We had a 6 p.m. dinner reservation on a Saturday evening. We got the pate, beef bourguignon, salmon, and crème brûlée. All was delicious. The restaurant put a candle in the crème brûlée for his birthday--nice touch! We got drinks, too. The sparkling rose and cab franc both hit the spot. Our only complaint is the restaurant was SO SO SO SO SO SO SO hot. I have never sweat in a restaurant as badly as I did at this place. We heard several other people at other tables complain about the heat. I used the menu to fan myself for a little bit but didn't have that available anymore after we ordered. Wish I had been wearing a bathing suit lol"
1362,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 4/5Overall: A bit of a pricey meal for just an ok meal.The extended review...Food:Duck confit - 3/5 - I was excited for this since duck is my favorite.  The disappointing thing was that the duck was fairly dry.Service: 3/5 - The service was a bit slow.Ambiance: 4/5 - Super cute ambiance.
1363,"Everything about our experience at Boucherie was 5-star. Our reservation was promptly honored, service was impeccable, the chef was accommodating to an entrée change, and I am still dreaming of the steak. I knew when my boss said he was coming to NYC and would take me and my boyfriend to dinner, I had to take advantage of the free meal (teehee). I grabbed one of the last pre-9PM reservations and hungrily scoured the menu in anticipation.I could write a novella about how good the food was, but I'll try to stay on track here. We started with the frog legs, escargot, and ratatouille with sausage. Everything was cooked to perfection. The lamb sausage in particular was mind-blowingly flavorful. The sauces from the escargot and frog legs were perfect to drench the free sourdough bread in. And this bread... it was delicious. The best pre-meal bread I've had at a restaurant, hands down.For our entrée, we ordered the Plateau du Boucher to split between three people, substituting (at an upcharge) the filet mignon for a whole tomahawk rib-eye. I'm being completely honest here, I've never had steak in a restaurant as scrumptious as what I had at Boucherie. Each steak was cooked to perfection. The NY strip absolutely melted in my mouth. The bavette was wildly flavorful and fire-kissed. And the tomahawk... nothing makes me happier than living out my childhood Flintstones dream of gnawing the meat off a huge ""dinosaur"" bone (which I didn't do until I got home and away from civilized company).We barely made a dent in this platter, but I never wanted to stop eating it. We had many meals worth of leftovers to take home, and the steak was still delicious reheated or eaten shamelessly cold from the fridge.For sides, we ordered the creamed spinach, mushrooms, and mashed potatoes. These were not some afterthought sides simply meant to have the steak mask the flavor. They were all better than I could have expected and pleasantly enhanced the meal.For cocktails, I can't recommend La Vie en Rose enough. Perfectly sweet and almost too easy to drink. They also have a full bar and made my boss' very particular cocktail to his specifications.The three of us left dazzled, and we're still talking about this dinner weeks later. Admittedly, we (i.e., my boss) did spend $1,000 to have the best meal possible, so our experience definitely reflects that. Boucherie is a high-end restaurant, but you could get away with spending about $50 per person (pre-tax and tip) with a non-steak entrée and a drink.I'm pretty sure this place ruined me for steak. I will definitely be back, but our next meal will most certainly not be as lavish (/cry)."
1364,Great food and ambiance! There were 7 of us and we were sat promptly for our reservation. Our server Tamara was very knowledgeable and was able to give great recommendations. I ended up getting the burger and it was amazing! The table split the cheese plate which was great as well. Would definitely recommend for a date night or a night out with friends!
1365,"One of the best meals we had in NYC! We came here to celebrate my bestie's birthday and boy did we splurge-it was def the most expensive meal we had in NY but the birthday boy was definitely treating himself. We started off with some apps-the escargot, frog legs, and a Caesar salad. The escargot was my favorite appetizer. They were soaked in butter and perfect for dipping the bread into! Each slot had 2 escargot, so it's a good size for sharing. For the entrees, we got the plateau du boucher which was 2 lbs of meat-filet mignon, bavette steak, and a bone in NY strip. I usually gravitate towards filet mignon but I really enjoyed the bone in NY strip and who could forget the delicious bone marrow it was served with?!? The platter was more than enough for 4 people. The steak was cooked perfectly and came with some dipping sauces as well. Not knowing this, we also ordered the coq au vin which was phenomenal as well. The chicken fell off the bone and was extremely tender.For dessert, we couldn't decide which to get so we got the creme brûlée, mousse au chocolat, and the birthday boy wanted the pistachio bomb glacee. The creme brûlée was my favorite cause it was light and topped with berries and ended a heavy meal very well. The mousse was my second favorite. The pistachio bomb glacee was my least favorite only cause the chocolate they poured on top was so rich. A couple bites was good for me. I couldn't end a heavy meal with a heavy dessert as well. Overall, it was an excellent meal and the service was top notch. I'd highly recommend making a reservation here cause they get very busy!"
1366,"It's our first trip to New York from Chicago, let me tell you, I'd recommend this place for sure! The venue is beautiful, our waiter Erick was so kind and helpful, the food was delicious! From cappuccinos to pain au chocolat, spend your Saturday morning filling your tastebuds with goodness and lovely company. If I lived here, I'd for sure be a regular. Beautiful service Boucherie, thank you."
1367,"This review is for brunch. Came around 11:45am for two people on a Saturday without a reservation which was fine. Plentiful seating, both indoor and outdoor! The restaurant is beautifully decorated and would be great for groups. It definitely is on the pricier side for brunch, but all in all I think it's a solid option!I ordered the below:-Le Croque Madame: I'm a huge croque madame fan and this didn't disappoint. Sooo cheesy and perfectly cooked over easy egg. -Omelette Au Choix: it looks kind of sad in the photo, but it was good! Definitely has very strong goat cheese taste, so if you don't like that cheese you may want to order something else. They don't skimp on the toppings too which is nice. -Side order of fries: thin and crunchy. Just how I like them."
1368,"Everything At Boucherie West Village sparkled. Glassware, floors, bar, copper pots, smiles. So inviting. So clean. So polished. I kept looking over my shoulder. Was the Queen about to arrive? While some venues are COVID-weary (If I see any more dead plants edging plywood outdoor sidewalk sheds...) Boucherie is energized and up to the challenges of the times. I was there for drinks and hors d'oeuvres in their well-appointed outside space.The staff offered our group trays of finger food. Sleek, clever compositions. A companion who is anti-carb had plenty of choices to make her happy. I was glad to have a moment to meet Chef Andrew Sikorsky (Chef Drew) who is back at the helm after his kitchen's year and a half COVID hiatus, he recommends Boucherie's signature steak tartar and foie gras. He added, ""On Friday, frog's legs are back on the menu!""I ordered an Aperol Spritz. As a tour guide in Italy who takes delight in introducing his guests to this drink, I make mine with just Aperol and prosecco and a slice of orange. I know the proportions are right if the color is deeply saturated.  The Boucherie version is made in modo-Americano, lighter and with club soda. Much more refreshing while less intense. For my second drink I switched to their sparkling wine. An elegant offering!Boucherie West Village is located at the epicenter of what had once been the ""Gay Village."" Things have changed since I went bar hopping here as a babygay. The gay community is sunlit and no longer in need of a ghetto. Nowadays, same-sex couples hold hands on the sidewalks of my own UWS Lincoln Center nabe, and everywhere else in Manhattan. Stepping out of the subway at the Christopher Street stop and walking the few steps to Boucherie West Village remains a colorful and inviting experience but one marked by assimilation and diversity. I'm sentimental about the old days, but glad for the new."
1369,Came again and it did not disappoint. Did a walk in and was seated in the heated/covered outdoor patio area. Got the escargot again and it was straight buttery goodness!
1370,"We came here for brunch on Sunday. I would have given this place 5 stars but the host was pretty rude to us. I thought it was just happenstance but we arrived late and when I mentioned it to the group already seated at our table, they had a similar experience. The guy who took us to our table and our server were both great, so it could have just been the lady we met was having a bad day.The space was very cool -- we were sat in the upper floor which is a small nook that overlooks the first floor. The Eggs Benedict were one of the best I've tried -- I loved their English muffins which were wide enough to get a bunch of Canadian bacon on 'em, but not too thick to overpower each delicious bite.  Would definitely come back here again next time we are in NYC."
1371,What a wonderful experience after a day of shopping in the west village. Entering the beautiful environment of Boucherie was an aesthetic pleasure. Beautiful environment. The food and cocktails were delicious and the service even better. Very attentive. Especially from our waiter Akin. Definitely would recommend.
1372,"Boucherie was a fantastic French meal that really brought me back to Paris.  Came here on a weekday evening and it was surprisingly pretty busy.  I ended up getting the beef tartare and the French onion soup.  Both were fantastic and just what I was looking for.  I also had the pistachio bombe glacee which was great, but very rich.  Definitely worth a try if you like chocolate.  What I really loved about this place was the indoor ambiance, would definitely recommend it over the outdoor seating.  Service here is incredible as well with very attentive staff.  Would definitely come again!"
1373,"My friends and I came here for brunch and it was pretty good! Food:- large steak tartare (8/10)- pâté de campagne *my favorite! (10/10)- foie gras (6/10)- escargots (9/10)- pain perdu *pretty good French toast (9/10)- salade nicoise (6/10)- eggs benedict (8/10)- steak aux oeufs (8/10)Service: - our main server was really nice and friendly. We had someone else refill our waters and my friend had asked her a question about whether they had coffee, she ignored her and I said maybe she didn't hear you? The lady looked up, said yes we do and walked away. Seemed very odd and a bit rude? But whatever it's fine. Ambiance/ Space:- great space! Very big. They can take large parties with reservations."
1374,"This is one of the most elegantly designed restaurants I've been to in NYC. The minute you walk in, you feel like you're in Paris. The drinks are one of a kind. If you're a fan of gin, I highly recommend the Le Printemps- super rich with flavor and pretty strong too. Every appetizer that I had was very unique and intricately curated. The goat cheese tart was my personal favorite."
1375,"I had a great experience at this restaurant with Akin as my server. When you walk in, you must present your vaccination card and then you can be seated. It is a very atmospheric and romantic restaurant with low lighting. It is on the nicer end, especially with prices considered. When seated, you get water and bread and butter. The cocktails are $19 but worth it. They do not skimp on alcohol and are very nuanced. We got the gin drink and loved it!For dinner, I got the salmon which came with Brussel sprouts and carrots. It was the perfect amount. I was able to finish my entire meal feeling perfectly full! This is definitely a place to sit down and enjoy... you are not in and out and it is definitely  an experience! We (2) spent about 2.5 hours in the restaurant.Akin was a great server and was perfectly attentive. He was very pleasant and happy to be there. I would definitely return and had a really fun experience!"
1376,"For the price this place was, some of these dishes aren't really French cuisines. At the very least, ""American alterations"" of non existent dishes. The French words for the menu items like French fries are not used in france. Also, dishes should be open for alterations like changing a meat order to be cooked at a different temperature. This is to prevent health issues. Nevertheless the dishes try their best to stay true to the country it's representing."
1377,"A clean five stars with no hesitation.  Authentic, quality French food with a wine list to match delivered in a very nice setting, appropriately separated in these Covid times, with good outdoor options, and outstanding service.If you like and/or maybe miss real French brasseries (and I lived in Paris for 5 years), come here.  Food wise: escargots are traditional prep but they remove the shell and put two snails per divot in the plate.  Bonus.  Pate de Campagne was A+.  Mousse de Foie Gras was A-, very good but next time I'd order the pate.  Steak Frites was awesome as was Beef Bourguinon, which was an odd selection on a hot August day but my wife loved it nevertheless.  The presentation is, well, unusual -- it doesn't look that stew-like when it arrives but the flavors were amazing.  The surprise/sleeper was the Boudin Blanc which I ordered and wow, wow was it good.  Profiteroles and Creme Brule (both A+) for dessert and we were done.I'll be back.  Thanks to our servers -- tres bien fait!"
1378,"What a fabulous way to end a New York vacation! (our 1st since pandemic life began) They've created a beautiful cozy outdoor dining area. The food was beyond amazing... No one could decide which was the best dish because they were all delicious. And to cap it off, our waiter, Eric, so kindly gave us their book because he said we seemed to enjoy ourselves so much. We certainly did! Merci!"
1379,Our server Akin is amazing and the food is just as perfect!! Definitely a must try! Steak frites / a glass of pinot noir is the go to!
1380,"Really great Cuban-mexican place downtown.I heard about Cafe Habana from a few people, and actually tried their ghost kitchen takeout (kitchen united mix) a few weeks ago. The food was good even as takeout, so I was happy to try it out as a dine in experience.The inside is a simple diner style with booths/small tables. We didn't have to wait to get seated early on a weekend and table turnover generally seemed pretty reasonable.I had the corn and a salad with shrimp. I loved the corn, which had the perfect amount of toppings and seasonings. It's a little messy to eat, but there's plenty of napkins for that. My salad felt super fresh and crisp. The tortilla strips mixed in the salad were crunchy and didn't get stale/soggy as I ate. The dressing was a little plain (olive oil?), but tossing some hot sauce on made it even better.Definitely would come back or eat at the ghost kitchen, even if it's just for the corn..."
1381,"RUN, don't walk to go get an amazing CUBANO sandwich. The best I've ever had. Perfectly toasted, delicious sauce. My only wish is that there were more pickles on it. I asked for more, but they didn't have them.Incredible corn on the cob. Great music and a happy vibe.I'm thrilled that they actually checked my Vaccination card and ID. Coming from the west coast, all restaurants say vaccination card required, but almost no restaurants ever check!"
1382,"Some friends and I were visiting NYC and were on the lookout for something juicy for lunch. We saw Cafe Habana and knew we didn't have to look any further. The venue is unassuming but has a great parklet, a vibrant blue storefront, and warm hospitality. Here's what we ate:Cubano Sandwich - Voted best in NYC. I haven't had any other Cubano in NYC, but I DID think this was a bomb.com sandwich. Great toast on the bread, perfectly melty cheese, and SO much flavor in the braised pork. I have yet to have a Cubano that packs a similar flavor. I'm drooling thinking about it. Tostones con Guacamole - LOVED these, super addicting as a shared snack.I took bites out of my friends' food too. One friend ordered tacos while the other ordered what I think was the Avocado & White Cheese Torta. I think the vegetarian taco was the only one that was not the favorite. The Torta was great in its own way, but I thought my Cubano was superior. We realized we probably should have tried the corn since it seems to be very well-received here, but we were stuffed already. Next time!"
1383,"For the food, I would give it 5 stars.If the boss is reading this review, I recommend changing the staff,I come here from Long Island only to eat corn, this has never happened to me, but today I was quite disappointed and unwilling to tip, the first time I thought this was racism? Or what,From the moment she entered, she had a bad expression and the other servers were also quite unfriendly. When we left time, an employee named Maria was very kind to me, so I wanted to give her a separate tip.Rose and Roslyn?  Their service was the first unfriendly experience I had while living in New York, and the next time I come back, I don't want to go in if they're still working here.Ps. You didn't seem unkind to other guests, why did you do that to me and my daughters?"
1384,"Post Covid Cubano sandwich as good as always!  New, bigger restaurant with more tables inside & outside.  Sat on the iconic red bench outside for lunch."
1385,"We were both craving for Cuban food so we decided to make a trip to visit cafe habana and it was definitely worth the trip! We got the 1.Cuban Sandwich with fries2.Caribbean Style Citrus Marinated Roast Pork PlateServed with rice & beans3.Grilled Corn -Cafe Habana's Famous corn Mayo, Cotija Cheese and Chili powder served with a lime wedge4. Toastones & Guacamole - Fried Green Plantain with our House Guacamole & Garlic MojitoI didn't have a favorite, everything was delicious and I enjoyed every dish!"
1386,"Great authentic place Everything is so delicious and the place is so cute and fun, I will especially recommend the grilled corn that was absolutely great,"
1387,"As a Florida native I've had Cuban sandwiches better than Cafe Habana, but they still make a solid sandwich.  Their sandwich is a little smaller than one would except and they are a little skimpy on the Jamón and Pork. I believe they also opt out for mustard and use some type of houseware sauce which I wasn't very Fond of. Their pickles as well don't provide the acidity I'm used to. Nonetheless, the sandwich is still flavorful, but wouldn't be my first choice.    The Mexican style corn however was enjoyable. I just wish they put in the extra 3 seconds of effort to flip the corn over and sprinkle Tajín on all of it. Only the front has Tajín and the side on the plate was lacking all the ingredients.    The limeade was solid. Nothing much to say about this very refreshing drink."
1388,"Came here and got a pork platter, Cuban sandwich, and Mexican street corn. Pork platter:Didn't feel too special. What you'd expect. Nothing really stood out but it wasn't badCuban sandwich:Tasted pretty good but bread was really hard to chew! I thought that my teeth was going to fall off :( also found a strand of hair in my sandwich. Told the waitress and she just said sorry really fast. Mexican street corn:The star of the meal! Honestly soo good. I saw lots of people coming here for just the corn and they know what's up!!"
1389,"Cafe Habana was my go to place pre-pandemic. I would go out of my way, bring people from out of town all the way down there to enjoy the amazing Cubano sandwiches. So of course, my first weekend back in NYC, I had to go back. I ordered my Cubano, some grilled corn with cojita cheese and grabbed an outdoor table to enjoy the sunshine. I was told that when I was ready to order, to go inside and place my order, no problem. Then I was told that I would have to pay immediately, again a bit weird, but I get it that they don't want people running out on a bill, I even preemptively gave a good tip (unfortunately). We ordered our drinks, and a couple glasses of water. The cans of coke came out quick enough, but no waters. Food came out quick enough, and the server asked if I wanted any ketchup for my fries, I asked for a side of mayo instead. The grilled corn was excellent, as expected (tough to mess that up) and I was so looking forward to this sandwich, but what a disappointment. The meat was very very juicy, but so much so to make the grilled bread soggy, but not in a good way. This itself was surprising, but what was more surprising was how such a small amount of meat could make this mess. Yes, there was very little pulled pork on the sandwich. Seemed like they not only skimped on volume, but overall, it was quite bland. Oh, and I never did get my side of mayo, but the waters did arrive just before we were done. I would be willing to give this place one more try, just because of how good it used to be and hopefully it's just a one time fumble."
1390,"I didnt think I could ever find a spot that incorporated boba with cream puffs. My boyfriend and I just had dim sum and since I'm a sucker for sweets I had to find a place that was walkable and I stumbled upon this spot which was a three minute walk from where we ate. It's a really small cafè that provides iced and hot drinks. Not so much bubble tea which i was kind of disappointed by. I ordered their iced coffee with mini boba and the presentation was adorable (flowers, and gold flakes on top of the drink), but the taste was super bitter. I was hoping it was sweeter, so I couldnt really finish it. The boba cream puffs were AMAZING!!! I ordered their vietnamese cream puff, milk tea, and matcha cream puff and I have to say that all of them were too good. I had to go back into the store to buy more because I thought what I had was not enough. My boyfriend isnt into sweets, but he was impressed by the puffs. Thankfully I live in Jersey City so I can always take a train or drive 20 minutes to have these amazing treats. Highly recommend!"
1391,"Pastries & TeaThe boba cream puff was something that I was waiting to try for such a long time! The moment you bite into it there is a gush of the boba cream and small little boba. Both the cream puff and the mocha donuts weren't too sweet which was amazing. The flavors for each was really enhanced in each bite. What really surprised me the most was the drinks here! They are so aesthetic and they have glitter and even edible rose petals. Loved this touch!Wait time There was a line to get these goodies. However the line went really quick and if you see a line here don't be afraid of the wait time it goes really quickly. SeatingDue to COVID there is no indoor seating, however there are seating set outdoor specifically for this store right outside! Brough my friends who were visiting NYC and they loved this spot!"
1392,"I might be the only person that doesn't care for Mochi donuts but I bought some anyway. I bought some taro munchkins but I don't like the chewy texture. It was like chewing a piece of gum. Now, the cream puffs here are to die for. This is my second trip this week for their yummy milk & honey cream puffs. Might make another trip this weekend. I also had the lychee rose tea and the royal milk tea with mini boba which is not only visually stunning, but delicious. The royal milk tea is made with whole milk and they don't have any alternatives. I'm lactose intolerant and don't drink whole milk but ordered it anyway, and surprisingly it didn't give me any trouble. I'm so thankful because I was far from home lol It's a cute little dessert shop with yummy pastries and teas. There's no inside seating but there's an outside area if you wanted to take a few photos for social media. I didn't see any chairs so I'm not sure if it's a seating area or not but it's really a grab & go kind of spot. I can't vouch for every cream puff but the milk & honey puff is amazing!!!Ig:@Soooomuchfun"
1393,"My opinion is 9.1/10.Def lived up to hype. I had the yuzu, has a lemon flavor and I did enjoy it. If back in the area would try other flavors I heard the boba  is what they are know for.Check out my in depth video reviews on any of the platforms below. TikTok: TheUrbanLegend4Instagram: UrbanLegend4Facebook: Panayoti KokalisYouTube: Urban Legend"
1394,"Please eat everything fresh! Right when you get it! Promise, it tastes SO MUCH BETTER. I guarantee you will enjoy every single bite because I sure did! The treats we brought back home to family in Philly (hour and a half drive) did not taste as delightful.. so please listen and eat right away :)"
1395,"That was some delicious Earl Grey tea.  Granted, not many beverages glitter with gold...as this one does.  It was so flavorful and rich.  The aroma was memorable and heavenly.  I would definitely return.  Only downside is there is no indoor seating...you have to take your stuff to go."
1396,Probably bookmarked this place several weeks ago.Located in Chinatown. Cute mochi donut establishment. So much to choose from but went with get 6 and 10% off. We also choose a Vietnamese coffee. Peep it out.
1397,I ordered a Royal Milk tea and loved it! It tasted similar to a blueberry matcha drink I've had that I really enjoyed. Not sure how else to describe the flavor but it tastes unique in a good way and the mini boba pearls add great texture! I love how aesthetic the drink looks and its topped with flowers + gold/silver flakes. Would definitely come here again to try their other aesthetically pleasing drinks!
1398,"Cute spot in China town. I'm so happy I stopped by for a mochi donut. Crispy outside, chewy inside. Great job. Fresh and sweet strawberry flavor. Not too overpowering."
1399,The cream puffs are huge and super extra stuffed. I felt super full after the first one. The brown sugar boba one was alright but the milk and cookies one was so good. Super super sweet though be advised.
1400,"Wow these are amazing sweet doughy delights in various flavors.  There is a sample of 6 for $25 and to die for.  Sweet, light and doughy doesn't taste like a donut.  Also tried the munchkins.  Delicious. Zero contact for Covid you order on an iPad, pay and they will call your number when ready. Check this place out yummy!!!"
1401,"This is cute and aesthetic dessert shop in Chinatown! Although their sweets weren't the best Ive ever had, im still glad I got to try it. You can order and pay using a tablet which is super convenient. We ordered the boba milk tea cream puff and creme brûlée donut.(1) Boba milk tea cream puff (4/5): the cream was so delicious and the boba was nice and soft! I wish the shell was a bit crispier though. (3) Creme brûlée donut (3/5): It wasn't bad, but I've had better in the Bay Area. Overall, I enjoyed my experience here and would like to try more cream puff flavors next time."
1402,"Mochi donuts and cream puffs have become more mainstream now, but Alimama was one of the originals. Every time I go to NYC, Alimama is always one of the places I have to stop by. The cream puffs are massive and there is so much filling inside. They always have cool new flavors coming out so try them all! I really enjoyed the ube cream puff and that is one of their original flavors. Can't go wrong with their matcha mochi donut either, also another classic. The donut is soft and chewy but it's topped with crunchy cereal and matcha powder, a nice juxtaposition. Make sure to eat everything fresh! I kept mine in the refrigerator for a day and the texture for both the cream puff and donut changed."
1403,"I couldn't take photos of this because I ate the cream puffs too fast. I tried the Vietnamese Coffee, Yuzu, and milk and honey cream puffs. The milk and honey was my least favorite but with that said it was still really good and if placed in front of me I would eat it again. My favorite was the coffee, but the yuzu really surprised me. It reminded me of a key lime pie so if you're looking for something bright and original, I would give that one a try."
1404,"Walking around Chinatown with a stomach full of soup dumplings didn't stop me from coming in. The cute aesthetic and pictures of a variety mochi donuts and cream puffs drew me in despite being super full. For Alimama, I made a special exception.....Walking in staff greets you hello but my introverted self immediately fell even MORE in love with the place when I saw the option to order on a tablet. First off that meant having minimal interaction with staff and secondly I could take my time browsing the menu because they do have plenty of tasty options and my already full stomach could only handle so much more foo.I settled on a classic mochi donut and cream puff. I'll be honest the mochi donut was basic but the green tea cream puff gave me life. Definitely coming back to order more cream puffs in the future!"
1405,"Stopped in here on a Sunday afternoon for a small treat/warm drink. No seating inside, but there are several ""order here"" kiosks to place your order.Decided to get the Signature Boba Milk Tea ($4), and shared a Bruleé Mochi Donut ($4). Drinks are priced right, though the pastries are more than usual. Milk tea came in at medium sweetness, which makes it drinkable without being overbearing. The little tapioca balls fit in through the straw but still clump at the bottom. Was disappointed in the donut - very chewy texture and not much flavor coming through from the topping. Also wasn't a fan of the gilded top, which only left glitter everywhere when trying to eat.While the service is efficient, you lose the personal touch of asking for recommendations/pairings. Maybe the cream puffs are the way to go."
1406,"Instagram worthy treats, but also tasty and affordable to back it up. Not overhyped, but deserving of so much more. Mochi donuts have exploded in popularity, but I haven't seen the mochi munchkins they offer here anywhere else. The munchkins are made to order, which adds a bit of waiting, but ugh fresh, warm, bite-sized, light donuts? Well worth. Most times they don't even make it to the train station if I pretend I'm taking them home. Not the basic bubble tea offerings, so just don't come for that. Pro tip: you can also get the cream puffs cut to ""share"" so the cream doesn't explode when you unhinge your jaw for the first bite."
1407,Was starving and decided to grab a snack from this place but was disappointed that it was not as good as I expected it to be. I got the brûlée mochi donut and the texture and taste of the mochi donut tasted a bit off and not fresh. The coating on the donut was pretty but they kind of hurt my teeth as I try to bite on this layer of hard sugar coating. Look forward to trying their other items such as the cream puffs next time tho!
1408,I got the Boba milk tea cream puff and the Lychee Rose drink. the cream puff was not too sweet and a perfect dessert! I was choking on some petals and leaves while drinking my drink but thats the price we pay for aesthetic drinks right?? I would definitely get both again when I come back!
1409,"One of the best boba places I've tried while visiting New York. It was very busy when I went Friday evening but they were pretty fast with my order. The munchkins we fluffy and flavorful. It was definitely a light snack you could share amongst your friends. The passionfruit green tea was amazing. Even without making any adjustments to the drink, it wasn't too sweet at all. I would recommend checking this place out if you're in the area and craving bubble tea."
1410,"My FAV mochi donut in the city. Perfectly chewy, not overly sweet, and a good selection of flavors. I really recommend the munchkins because they are usually made to order so you get it fresh out of the fryer. I recently tried the cereal mochi donut for the first time because it's my friend's favorite flavor and it was SO good. The crunchiness of the cereal with the chewiness of the mochi donut is a match made in heaven. They also have pretty good bevs - the royal milk tea is really good. They now have 4 self-serve kiosks for you to order from."
1411,"Great to-go mochi donut place in the middle of Chinatown, we had the brûlée donut and the matcha cream puff. Both good,  on the pricier side because items are really small but worth trying. Both items we had were high quality but the donut didn't feel as fresh as the puff, however the flavor was really good. Would recommend trying at least once. It was my first time trying this kind of pastries and I can now say I'm a fan of the mochi donuts."
1412,"I am so thrilled to finally tried this place after a few unsuccessful trips (i.e. too long of a line, was too full to eat anymore, came too late and they are closed). The order is so easy with four different self order machines or you can go to the cashier as well. I got lucky and it was pretty empty when I was there. I got to order immediately and got an mixed berry hibiscus with aiyu jelly topping as well as two cream puffs (matcha and Yuzu flavor)! The service was so efficient and the whole ambience is so nice. There are no sitting area so it's a to go place only but there are some seats outdoors if you want to eat. The drink wasn't too sweet and was so lovely with the gold leaf, lemon, flower petals in a beautiful dark purple hue. The cream puffs as you can see was filled fully (which is rare!) and the taste is AMAZING! I have tried many cream puffs but it's always so sweet. This has the right amount of sweetness and still brings out the delicate taste of the flavors and the beautifully crusted shell! Definitely should try the matcha and yuzu!!! Im such so bummed to have waited for so long to try this! Don't be me.... Go now!"
1413,"Super cute and unique dessert spot in Chinatown! I highly recommend the boba cream puffs. I tried the matcha & Vietnamese coffee boba cream puff - they were super decadent and delicious! I did try the Earl Grey Lavender drink and it was okay, I wouldn't get it again because it tasted watered down. It could be because of the flowers. I would definitely come again to try other menu items though. Interior was super cute and inviting!"
1414,"Really excellent, balanced, fresh, made to order treats! The Ube munchkins and boba cream puffs were perfection. I've had mochi donuts before but the  freshness of these blew all the others away. Would definitely come back to try more of their creative menu!"
1415,"Been wanting to try this forever but haven't been in the area. YUMMMM. I will have to say their cream puffs are better than their mochi donuts though the flavors are unique. The cream puffs are so delicate with perfect fills like coffee or lemon or matcha or regular (?) and the soft boba balls that you won't get full of it. The puff pastry itself is divine and just melts. The mochi donuts are good but definitely more dense than other spots so you're chewing a bit more - less of that airy texture from other places. They're quite beautiful though. All in all, very happy here."
1416,"This place has amazing beautiful mochi doughnuts. I have tried most of the doughnuts, but the one item that is my absolute favorite, and is a MUST- are the taro balls! I am sooo in LOVE! One order comes with 6 pieces and each taro ball comes with delicious taro shaving tasting powdered sugar. Also I would only recommend eating these when they're hot/warm because they taste so much better! If you're a cream puff fan, i recommend the boba milk tea cream puff! It's very light and the tapioca is soft and chewy! Side note: if you try to order these taro balls from DoorDash, you won't actually find them, so you need to order (1) doughnut and then in the comments ask to be replaced as taro balls, and Alimama will understand!"
1417,"Wow. How do they make the drinks sooo pretty but also sooo delicious!! Most places just get one or the other right, but Alimama gets both!I tried the rose lychee tea (my go-to flavor combo) and did less ice and less sugar and it was incredible. My friend ordered the Vietnamese cold brew and she loved it too. A little on the pricier side, but worth it. The most unfortunate part was deciding what to order because every single item looked amazing! I will definitely come back here and order more drinks and try the mochi donuts and cream puffs!!"
1418,"Saw a crowd here on the way to Xi'an, and was immediately woo'd by the buzz words on the menu. ""Yuzu"", ""Onyx"", ""Cereal"", ""MOCHI"". I ordered almost half the menu and took one bite of each. Matcha munchkin - omg 20/10. I think about these all the time. The flavor of these are so bold and the texture is even better than mister donut in Asia. And I loved that these were bite size, like donut holes.Mochi donuts strawberry, cereal, onyx - 8/10. These were good too but I think I would have enjoyed them a lot more if they were donut holes! Yes i understand it's the same, but it's a diff experienceBrown Sugar Boba Cream Puff - 10/10. I actually ordered this on their iPad by mistake, I was more interested in the Yuzu one but this did not disappoint!"
1419,"This place is a must if you want to satisfy your sweet cravings! The ordering system was easy to follow to select your food option on the digital screen.  After I ordered my donuts and drink, it literally took 5 minutes to get my order!Recommend - Onyx and the Brulee Mochi Donut and the passion fruit green tea! Plus, they have a standing area outside to enjoy your sweet treats!"
1420,"I'm sorry, this place is all aesthetics and not much more...My brother got the coffee and was wondering what the point of the designer toppings were. He said it was okay. I came here specifically to try the mochi donuts. They were.... sadly not amazing. First time ever trying mochi donuts and it did not do much for me. Consistency was too chewy, a little hard and the taste wasn't good. I bought all the flavors. I tried the onyx and sweet/salty which both glaze was kinda gooey and I didn't like the consistency.Hmm sorry, I'm not a fan.Also the workers weren't really welcoming and didn't ask me if I had any questions. Not great customer service since they have the iPad/touch screens for Covid safety"
1421,"If you're on a donut tour or in search of Instagram-able drink options, then make sure you check out Alimama.  I most appreciated the ordering options so that I could get my donut and cream puff quickly.My mochi donut rec: strawberryMy cream puff rec: yuzu"
1422,"Yuzu cream puff, not too sweet, tons of citrus flavor in the whipped cream, crusty topping, perfectBrulee mochi donut, also not to sweet, crunchy topping, chewy texture, fried dough, i only wish there was more of itthe drink had classic lychee flavor, so nothing to write home about, but was very pretty to look at."
1423,"Boba in cream puffs is an interesting concept. I think it works pretty well, though I think the cream at Bibble & Sip is a bit better. The mochi donut was also good and hit the right spot in terms of chewiness like mochi."
1424,"If you love a cheery sweeeet treat this place is for you. the mochi donuts are soo sweet and taste like candy. The puffs however are so perfectly sweetened and I love the mousse inside. As a huge lychee fan I loved the lychee rose tea, all the flavors I love and the cutest presentation!! It's right next to a plant store so I got a cute elephant ear plant while I waited for myorder."
1425,They have a bunch of self-order kiosks that make the experience super safe. I ordered their passion fruit green tea with aiyu jelly and it was decorated with flower petals and some edible gold glitter powder. It was a beautiful drink and tasted really clean!
1426,"Upon entering this small shop, you have 4 self-serving kiosks you can use to order what you want. Once you've paid, they'll prepare your order and they are freakishly fast! I went twice during my 4 day trip! I don't drink tea or coffee (yes, I'm aware I'm weird), but I did get the Vietnamese Cold Brew for my mom and she said she liked it but could have done without the Gold Leaf and Rose Buds in the drink. I also got a handful of their Mochi Donuts - Brulee (AMAZING!), Cereal (Good), and Strawberry. I had the Brulee ones pretty much immediately and they were great. I did eat the Cereal one a few days later and though reheating it in the microwave improved it, it was not that great, which isn't it's fault - flavor wise it was great, but the Brulee is definitely my favorite.Like I mentioned, the donuts don't last a while, they do get firm and kinda bleh after they sit for a few days (I got mine on Monday, drove back to MA, and today (Wednesday) ate one), however, microwaving it for 10-15 second seemed to help it. I have one more (Brulee) that I'll probably eat that way. I wish I had the opportunity to try the Cream Puff, but I would come back for their Donuts as long as I eat them within the same day and hopefully try their cream puffs."
1427,This place is definitely overhyped. I had it bookmarked for so long and finally came.The drinks are really pretty but you MUST make sure to mix the heck out of them before you drink it or it will taste kind of gross...We also ordered a cream puff and I can't remember which one we got but clearly it wasn't memorable. However our friend is a regular here and told me I should have gotten the Vietnamese coffee one instead so maybe try that one if you decide to go?
1428,"Walked by this spot and decided to try it as I as craving something sweet. The shop was small but service was good. I got the boba cream puff and a donut. Out of them both, the boba cream puff was better. The texture is crunchy and filled with cream and boba inside. Give this place a try if you are ever around the area!"
1429,"Came here for a normal mochi donut and then also the taro munchkins.I would come back here for just the taro munchkins. It wasn't too sweet and just hit the right spot. Great texture, some crunchiness on the outside, and couldn't stop popping them in my mouth.The mochi donut was fine, but not super memorable. Get the taro munchkins one and you'll love it!Can't vouch for anything else here"
1430,"My favorite soft serve place!Lots of Asian-esque flavors like black sesame, milk tea, green tea, and ube.The ice cream is very rich and creamy for soft serve. Last time I was there, there was quite the line, but the worker there was busting his a$$ fulfilling orders - felt bad he was the lone person there working that night. Seems like a lot of people like to add various toppings, but I usually just take the ice cream straight out of the machine, and they are very good as-is.Price is very reasonable for the quantity and quality.Definitely drop by if you're in the area and need to satisfy that sweet tooth."
1431,"Delicious!! I had the Hong Kong milk tea and black sesame swirl - it didn't disappoint. The consistency of the soft serve was spot on. The ingredients tasted really fresh without a powdery aftertaste. They didn't have matcha when I visited, but I'm excited to go back and try their matcha soft serve!"
1432,We stopped by on a Sunday evening and tasted some of the best soft serve ice cream flavors in the city! My family and I enjoyed the delicious flavors of Ube and Matcha. The worker was approachable and was very helpful. We saw some customers getting pints to-go which is also a great option if you live nearby!We especially love how there are seats inside the shop so that we can enjoy our ice cream indoors during the cold weather! It's hard to find a place where we can sit down to enjoy ice cream in Chinatown!
1433,Good price and good flavors. I got the ube soft serve with condensed milk and Cap'n Crunch on a chocolate cone. Was really yummy and fully worth the 7 bucks.
1434,I discovered this place through Yelp and google. There were tons of good reviews for it. I came here and tried the Hong Kong style milk tea and black sesame swirl. The HKMT was pretty good and complimented well with the black sesame. The soft serve had a nice ice cream texture and I'm glad it wasn't too icy as many soft serve places have it. It was very creamy and yummy.
1435,"They have hefty samples for you to try! The soft serve is at a harder, creamier consistency which is exactly what I like! My flavor preferences by favorite: milk tea, black sesame, ube. The total comes out to $5.99 which is pretty pricey for ice cream to me. However, it's worth trying."
1436,"Wow, this place was amazing. Soft serve icecreams are my favorite type of icecream and this place did not disappoint. It also makes me wonder if the owner is filipino having macapuno and ube in their menu. I definitely ordered the ube and it didn't disappoint. I hope to come back once the weather gets warmer."
1437,I got a ube soft serve with Oreo crumbs on a waffle cone. It was delicious and plentiful for $8! Worth every penny!!!
1438,"This is one of the top-rated soft serve places in New York but unfortunately it did not live up to the hype.I went on a weekday afternoon and there was no line. They had six flavors available -- ube, almond cookie, ube/almond swirl, matcha, vanilla, and matcha/vanilla swirl. I opted for the matcha vanilla swirl in a cup. The menu in the store says the price is $5.50 but I was charged $6 (not sure why). If you want a waffle cone it is +$1.75 and also extra $ for toppings and drizzles.First of all, the presentation was horrible. Soft serve is supposed to be swirly, tall, and mountainous! Instead, my ice cream was served as a melting puddle straight from the machine. It wasn't even hot outside, so there is no excuse. My serving was already 50% melted when it was handed to me. How is that considered acceptable?Presentation aside, the quality and taste were... ok. The matcha flavor was faint and the texture was comparable to any standard soft serve ice cream. Nothing particularly special. I was expecting the texture to be smooth, thick, and creamy, yet sturdy and melts in your mouth at the same time. This was not up to that level.Maybe my ice cream being served melted had something to do with it. Not sure who was working that day but this is how to NOT serve soft serve ice cream."
1439,"Believe the hype. I am not exaggerating when I say this is the best soft serve I have ever tried. Soft Swerve offers soft serve ice cream, and that's it! Their menu includes popular Asian flavors like matcha, ube, Thai tea, etc, and fun toppings. You can create your own combination, or choose one from their specials menu. I got the Strawberry Fields, a mountain of matcha soft serve, topped with fresh strawberry syrup, and delicately crunchy freeze dried strawberries. The soft serve was silky smooth, richly creamy, and packed with earthy matcha flavor. Swirled atop a vanilla scented, bright pink Konery cone, every bite was a real treat. The owners are both native New Yorkers who grew up in this area. Staff were polite. The shop is cute and colorful, with a few tables inside. Highly recommended."
1440,"Soft ice cream seems easy to make, it was hard to find a place that serves perfect soft and sweet ice cream. I decided to check out soft swerve as I was passing by because of my childhood memory of eating soft serve cream. First of all, they have unique asian flavors such as ube and matcha, which was a big plus as I love those flavors. I decided to check out matcha and it was perfect when it comes to the sweet/bitterness of matcha for a soft serve ice cream. Will definitely come back to try other flavors!"
1441,"Get the ube soft serve!!! Incredibly creamy and packed with ube flavor. My friends got the matcha with strawberry toppings which was still quite good, although the strawberry syrup was weirdly too tarte. Also didn't like the fact that you couldn't swirl some flavors together (such as ube + matcha) Still a great place for dessert at a fairly reasonable price."
1442,"Not too hard to find, despite it's location. I would suggest arriving way before closing, as they run out of flavors & toppings, ect. Visited last night, but no more chocolate? Ehh, it WAS pretty darn packed inside, when we got there...so. Must be a pretty well-known place, although I haven't heard of it until last night. Well, the VANILLA they did have, was definitely good. I do recommend! Worker that was there seemed visibly bothered by the lack of options left, however, it was 20 mins before closing on super bowl Sunday. That's on me, though!"
1443,"I really like that Soft Swerve has Asian-flavored ice cream. I tried the Ube and Thai Tea swirl and it was great. They have lots of toppings to choose from (I went pretty basic with rainbow sprinkles and Oreo crumbles) and everything makes for a very Instagram-worthy experience. The ice cream itself is still great, regardless. I especially liked the Ube flavor."
1444,"I'm obsessed with soft serve, which can be surprisingly hard to find in NYC (other than ice cream trucks - no shade to the trucks, but I was looking for something a little less ""I'm a child and it's hot out"" and a little more ""I'm a grown woman eating fancy ice cream""). I dragged my husband and father-in-law here after seeing the incredible reviews (but not looking at the menu at all). When I arrived and saw flavors like Ube purple yam, matcha, and black sesame I was like ""What the..."". But let me tell you, it was the BEST soft serve of my life. Creamy, flavorful, beautiful, mouth watering goodness. I ordered the purple yam/black sesame swirl. And I dream about it. Pro-tip: Ube purple yam/black sesame swirl with Oreo topping is amazingggg. Turns out I am an child and it's hot out. Biggest surprise: this place is a little hole in the wall on a quiet street. Totally unassuming. Don't judge a book by its cover. All in all: This place is swerving up cold creamy deliciousness!"
1445,Stopped in to have this delectable soft serve while visiting the city.  Amazing flavors and toppings.  Loved it so much.  I keep checking my city to see if I can get it anywhere near me.  Sadly stil not yet.
1446,"My favorite place to get matcha soft serve is Matcha Love at Mitsuwa in Edgewater, NJ, but this place has a pretty decent version with friendly staff, who recommended I top my ice cream with toasted coconut or strawberry syrup. I usually prefer my matcha ice cream plain and I'm not too crazy about coconut as a topping, but the toasted version was pretty good! Crunchy and not too coconutty, lol. I'll have to try their other location next time."
1447,"Great soft serve spot with some delicious flavors! I ordered the swirl with Oolong Tea and Frozen Hot Chocolate which was definitely the move. Individually the flavors are pretty great, but when swirled together it was fantastic. Glad I got to visit this spot!"
1448,Love the unique flavors like ube and sesame! A little bit of a steep price for a cone but it was definitely worth trying. The staff was super friendly too!
1449,"matcha ube black sesame swirl - so delicious, matcha was not too sweet and Ube black sesame complemented it so well frozen chocolate - so delicious if you're craving chocolate. These soft serves are perfectly creamy!! Can't wait to visit more in summer!"
1450,This place is good! A little pricey but it's NYC. I know everyone really raves about the ube but personally I like the frozen hot chocolate/matcha swirl!
1451,"Order:- Hot Chocolate Ice Cream in a Cup with Almonds and Rainbow Sprinkles Pros:- Great tasting ice cream ~ really just tasted like frozen hot chocolate - A lot of topping options - Quick service Cons:- I feel like having the basic vanilla is a must and was shocked to see they didn't have it Overall: Great tasting ice cream, but it's definitely lost the hype it once had years ago"
1452,"I got their ube and almond swirl, which was a great combination and really hit the spot! The ice cream was super smooth and the flavors balanced really well together. This was just my first time here, so I got the soft serve without toppings to try it, but I think I'll add some toppings too next time! They didn't have the black sesame flavor that I initially wanted to try, but hopefully they will the next time I come here. Also, there's no seating so you should make sure you're ok with buying your soft serve to go here."
1453,If Ube is a flavor option... I'm ordering Ube.  This is one of the best the city has to offer.  Thanks to the server who encouraged me to top mine with Fruitty Pebbles because WOW!!
1454,"This place has one of the best asian-inspired flavored soft serve ice creams, I am always tempted to stop in after every meal but I clearly can't on the account that I don't want to end up fit through the door of this establishment!!In all seriousness, this place has the best matcha, black sesame, and taro soft serve ice creams - it is so creamy and not too sweet and is very very delicious. I would say that the black sesame is less sweet compared with the other options, but that would be perfect to mix/blend with the other flavors. Love this place and this can be seen as lots of folks love this establishment, as well as the line, can be quite long at times, honestly though it is not that bad of a wait - service is super fast and they are on top of it! The toppings are not to be missed as well, although I do enjoy the ice cream just plain. Would recommend this place to anyone visiting and is craving some ice cream!!"
1455,"The Ube and black sesame is so flavorful. But to be honest I think the Ube they use too much food coloring. It stain the cloth very easy. I would recommend get single flavor because both flavors are strong, kinda overpowering each other. Portion is very large, good money for the amount of soft serve you get"
1456,Very good soft serve ice cream however its for a super steep price. Not even Mr.Softy charges this much in a touristy area + the amount of topping they give you is laughable. I got Crushed Oreos and they provided a dusting.
1457,"This is really good soft serve. I came here for the ube flavor. It's sweet tasting like a mix of purple yam and coconut. It goes well with black sesame, which tastes like tahini with a hint of vanilla. They have a bunch of other interesting flavors that they let us try. I definitely will be back for one of their sundaes!"
1458,"I love this place! I have come here countless times for the ube soft serve, which is flavorful, creamy and delicious. I love the mochi topping and I have tried it with fruity pebbles too, but the fruity pebbles take away the flavor from the ice cream. I highly recommend this ice cream shop and will definitely be back!"
1459,"Didn't want to do Van Leeuwen yet again, and when I saw ube on the menu, I didn't need to look any further. I got the ube and almond cookie swirl in a small cup, and it was still a very generous serving. The ice cream texture was creamy and rich, and the ube flavor was perfectly nutty. The almond cookie side was good to but almost too subtle in flavor. Maybe by itself it would have stuck out more. But all in all very satisfying. They have a plethora of toppings too if you are inclined."
1460,"Next level soft serve. There is a reason why this place has such high ratings, the quality is just impeccable. I have always loved the Ube & Black Sesame swirl, so much that I never ventured away from it. I highly recommend this place."
1461,"Ube Cup ($5.99): ube flavor is present!! Sometimes ube desserts aren't actually made of ube, but in this case the flavor is on point. Definitely recommend the ube flavor at least once. Adding toppings range from 50 cents to a dollar per topping so I passed, but they have a mochi topping! Ordered in person, served immediately!"
1462,"Soft Swerve is back! AND, at a new location too in Murray Hill. Same awesome stuff, but just right now served out of a small opening at the front of the store, so go help support to keep them alive through these terrible times.They have 4 flavors right now (Ube, Frozen Hot Chocolate, Matcha and Milk Tea), but were not doing swirls. They also have pints to go. Get a cone of Ube or Hot Chocolate for a perfect refreshing treat in the heat that's just started."
1463,This soft serve place is a unassuming gem! Their flavors are original but the classics are great. We got the éclair and it was wonderful!  I highly recommend this place!
1464,I was bummed they didn't have frozen hot chocolate last night when I was there so I ended up trying the Matcha which wasn't bad either.
1465,"We tried the ube and black sesame flavors, and they were really good. The soft serve is creamy and not too sweet, and both had very strong flavors. The cone is pretty big and enough for 2 people."
1466,"One of my favorite dessert places!Soft Swerve only really has 4 main flavors, but honestly, those alone are enough to keep you coming back for more. Especially, the ube. It's super soft, super creamy, and light. The black sesame has a stronger flavor, but I think it pairs really well with the ube. You can mix and match any 2 flavors onto a cone or cup. I personally enjoy eating it with the flavored cones (chocolate & cinnamon) better than on a cup, although it does cost extra. If you're unsure of the flavors, you can always get a sample before buying! Also, the staff are all super nice and friendly."
1467,"this ice cream joint is not big and might not look much from the outside but sure is an awesome find! they serve Asian-inspired flavors like ube, black sesame, matcha, and so on. I am almost obsessed with anything ube this, I must have that flavor withoutb a question. However, I ordered the one with black sesame swirl. You can then have various toppings. Mochi is a famous option but for unknown reason I wanted chocolate sprinkles that day. Regardless, it tasted so good! Definitely one of the foods that can lighten up my mood and brighten my day. Might sound a bit hyperbolic but sort of true. like the name, the texture was very soft and light. A lot of soft serve end up tasting like just the same cold sweet something with no prominent flavor anymore, but not this one. The ube and black sesame flavor actually lingers and albeit bold, not overwhelming. I'm personally very pleased with my option of having chocolate sprinkles for topping but go ahead with whatever you like. Price wise I think it's reasonable. By the way, they do have a couple of tables for indoor seating"
1468,"Nice place for a quick bite of sweetness, especially in the heat! There are maybe 3 tables inside, and plenty of asian dessert flavors that swap out frequently. I'd love to go back and try the black sesame sometime!"
1469,This place is so good! Their frozen hot chocolate ice cream is delicious and the staff is nice. Love their selection of toppings too! Definitely a great summer treat.
1470,This is the best soft serve ice cream I've ever had before. The black sesame and ube swerve is so creamy and delightful. I've noticed trendy dessert spots in/near Chinatown are bit more pricier but this soft serve is definitely worth it.
1471,"I used to live a block from this place and wish I'd tried it sooner than I did. The flavors are all pretty unique but so tasty, and the toppings all go super well with them. I love the Ube with Mochi and Fruity Pebbles the most. Tiny and unassuming shop but definitely worth stopping in!"
1472,Yea I came for that pretty purple Ube ice cream and it did not disappoint! The black sesame seed flavor looked good too. Tough choice so I got them both in a double swirl and just to be a little extra added sprinkles. Pricey at about $8-9 per cone but I wanted the full experience of soft swerve. Both flavors were equally good. Due to covid there was no indoor dining option. Just order from outside and get going with your cone. Tiny shop down on the lower east side and easy to miss if you don't look closely. Overall a nice treat but expensive if you want to go often. Pretty for the gram.
1473,"Great ice cream. I'm a fan of intense matcha flavors so I was fine w/ the significant bitter aftertaste. My friend likes matcha but likes it diluted (like sweetened milk lattes) so she was not a fan. But the ube is always solid and is usually what I come here for. The black sesame is also solid but that's kind of like a ""you love it or you hate it"" kind of flavor. If you're trying one thing, get the ube. (Ask for samples before you buy!)"
1474,"I tried their Hong Kong milk tea and it was flavorful and delicious. It tasted exactly like the milk tea but in soft serve version. However, the ube purple yam flavor was disappointing. I was really excited for it because I'm a huge fan of ube, but it lacked the flavor and just tasted very sweet. To be honest, I'm not sure if this is worth 5 bucks. When I visited, they had ube, HK milk tea, Thai tea, and chocolate flavor and out of those 4 flavors, I liked the HK milk tea the most and then probably the Thai tea which I tried before opting for the milk tea flavor.Although I was a bit disappointed, I still want to come back and try their black sesame or matcha green tea flavor when those get back on the menu.P.S. $5 card minimum!"
1475,"This is a very late review as I tried this ice cream place late last year but forgot to put a review. The ice cream was delicious and so were the toppings. However, I don't feel like it stands out much from other popular ice cream places in the city but it's good nonetheless."
1476,"Everyone I know will definitely hear about and have to come to this place. The flavor is delicious - not too sweet and not bland. The Black Sesame is a must try, along with the Ube of course! I cannot wait to return. Everyone was satisfied and had a great experience!"
1477,"I needed to get my hands on these cones after seeing them pop up on instagram so I went ahead and got myself an ube and lychee swirl with mochi in a chocolate waffle cone. This spot seems to rotate among 4 flavors (with 2 swirl options) and offers a decent selection of toppings (crunchy and chewy). Now, I've never had ube before and after trying this out, I realized I'm not quite a fan of it but I won't let that take away from the richness of this soft serve. The lychee was a bit more understated than I had expected but I preferred its mild taste to that of ube's. I didn't find this place particularly exceptional so I don't think I would go out of my way to come back here just for the ice cream."
1478,"I love the ice cream here! I love soft serve and they have a lot of delicious flavors from Japan. I used to eat matcha soft serve all the time when I lived in Tokyo so it was so nice to have again! Also Ube, Black Sesame ans Chocolate as well as a twist of certain flavors. If you want something different and original I highly recommend it!"
1479,"Every time I come here , they are always so nice to me! I normally come here for the perfect ube ice cream! The topping selection is a little generic being mostly tourist probably come here. I feel as if the toppings should be as intriguing as the flavors. They rotate the flavors often but will always have Ube on deck for you! Perfect place to chill when it's not busy. Today I got the Uber and hot chocolate swirl topped with crushed Oreos and a regular ube flavor! I would always say no vegan friendly options, but they should throw one in every time to get more customers."
1480,"Keens is a classic steakhouse that's been around for hundreds of years basically. This is a historical landmark. The presidents and celebrities who have smoked pipes at this establishment is remarkable. Must order: mutton chops, bacon for The table, chambored for 2, and the fries. We started off with the bacon  (deliciously thick) and shrimp cocktail for the table. Entrees included filler minion (both sizes) the steak for 2, lamb chops, surf and turf, and all the sides. The lamb was cooked to perfection, steaks did not miss, house wine delicious, service impeccable.Aaron was amazing and put up with our large thirsty group all night."
1481,"The restaurant has been opened since 1885, it is one of the oldest restaurants in NY and the first thing I noticed about the restaurant was their décor. I love visiting restaurants that take you to a time and place and I felt I was transported to old New York and I was obsessed with the different rooms and different relicts hanging from the wall. Truth be told, I think it is worth visiting for the history alone. I first heard of this restaurant from an old episode of No Reservations, in the episode Bourdain and Josh Ozersky went bonkers over the mutton chop and the King Cut Prime Rib, ever since then I wanted to make a visit.The food:Mutton Chop- This is actually their signature dish and it's absolutely something to order. The mutton was so incredibly tender and a great dish to share with another diner or two. I enjoyed the mutton but I did find a few flaws with the dish, first I am not a salty food person but I felt the mutton was under seasoned, I had to to reach for the table side salt shaker a few times. Second, as much as I appreciated how tender it was, I was sad there wasn't a crust on the mutton for some added texture. I felt the mutton had the same feel of like a prime rib or sous vide, they all had a baked meat feel which I feel is missing something. The homemade mint jelly was actually surprising to me since I wasn't expecting to like it but it was a good mint jelly but a tad too sweet for me. I did appreciate that it was made in house and they used actual mint, I felt using real mint made a big difference. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Prime Porterhouse- This sucker was huge, it was definitely more steak than the one they serve at Lugers. I thought the steak was good, it was cooked perfectly but this was missing that outer char as well, it was definitely a tender steak but I thought it kinda lacked that nice beefiness you get from dry aged, it almost had like a wet aged feel. I also was a little surprised they didn't cook it in butter or had any butter drippings. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Keen's Creamed Spinach- I thought this was a very good version and I enjoyed how some of the spinach wasn't completely cooked through, it added a nice bite. But I think Lugers still has the best creamed spinach.Mashed Yukon Gold- This was the only thing I wasn't a fan of. The mash seemed very pedestrian, it seemed very cafeteria like quality mash.Key Lime Pie- They make these in house and I thought it was fantastic. I really loved the consistency, the taste and texture. I enjoyed how it wasn't too sweet and I loved the bitterness this dish had to counter the sweetness. I would love to get this again."
1482,"Where do I begin?Came to Keens for dinner to celebrate my birthday because it had great reviews and I've never felt so discriminated against during a dining experience. Food was too mediocre to be pretentious. Walked through the door and was not greeted, had to wait a second for a host to even acknowledge us. I stated I had a reservation and felt like either I didn't belong in this restaurant or they gave a strong feeling of ""what are you doing here?"" I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and didn't think about it much at first. When we were seated and served, we were never given menus when the server was trying to take our orders, it was also not busy during the time because we came before the dinner rush. It felt like our server didn't want to work with us and every time he passed by slowly he would glare at us. The breaking point was seeing him act cordial and friendly to the tables next to us, and at that point we really just wanted to leave. By the end he didn't even ask if we would like dessert but rather ""skipping dessert?"" I believe we were suppose to be brought out a dessert because it was my birthday but that didn't happen. As we were leaving, no acknowledgement as well when there were about 5-6 staff members by the door. For spending $300 at an establishment, you would expect some level of decency and service but that was not the case here. I've never had such an terrible dining experience before. Really ruined the rest of my night, not returning and not recommending. I felt embarrassed for making a reservation here and subjecting my friends to such treatment since it was my recommendation. Food: Bread rolls: warm rolls, cold butter1/2 dozen oysters: shucked terribly, ripped mantle but still stuck to the shell, looked dry and deflated.Porterhouse for 3: ordered medium rare, strip was pretty rare and the tips were over cooked, probably rushed. A bit under seasoned for us, nothing to rave about, expected more but morale was too lowMarket roasted vegetables: good, liked the onions and carrots the mostDrinks:Pimm's Cup: great cocktail, the only redeeming quality of the night"
1483,"I made a reservation at Keens for my husband's birthday and he loved it! I specifically requested to have happy birthday written on his dessert and they did not forget!My husband and I tried their Mulled Wine since it was a cold windy night. The wine was warm, flavorful, and subtly sweet...basically a warm sangria!Their Butter Lettuce House Salad was light and refreshing and better than your traditional Caesar Salad.The Thick Cut Bacon appetizer was huge. You get three pieces and it's definitely enough to share for the table.Their Hash Brown was more of a baked mashed potato. It was good but it wasn't anything special. The Porterhouse for Two was nicely done. We requested it to be cooked Medium and it came out just right. The best part was the Keens' Coffee Cantata! We wanted dessert but didn't want anything too big. The ice cream sundae was generous on the fudge and whipped cream. We ate every last bit of it!"
1484,"Wow! My friend took me here and ordered on my behalf. The mutton, medium rare, and sliced. This was my first experience ever having mutton and it tasted of high quality steak. The venue was low lit and had an old feel to it. Perfect place for a date. They had pipes on the walls of many famous individuals such as Babe Ruth, JFK, etc. This place is a must go if you want to spoil yourself. It's definitely not cheap, but worth the experience.The service was very professional and helpful with any questions."
1485,"Dominick is my guy. The staff there always make me feel like family & the food is always on point, I'm in love  with they're lobster . Lobster is so sweet an tasteful  & they give you enough no matter how many ponds you order. The whipped potatoes  taste like my grandmother was in the kitchen, consistency is always there when i go. My girlfriend LOVES they roasted chicken with the artichoke Au jus."
1486,"Loved the mutton and escarole! I was surprised at how much I liked it. Would recommend it medium even though we usually get our steaks medium rare. Also enjoyed the banana foster dessert. The ambiance was great - very cool, old school NY steakhouse feel and loved the pipes everywhere. Was not a fan of the porterhouse for two - we got it medium rare and it was over cooked. Maybe just came in a bad night. Also didn't like the key lime pie. I liked that they brought out a candle on the sundae dessert for the birthday boy and sang. Love when they go the extra mile for special occasions!"
1487,Food 4.5/5.0Service 3.5/5.0Value 3.0/5.0Decor 3.0/5.0Overall 4.0/5.0Great classic steakhouse. Mutton is definitely worth getting. Beef is obviously good too. Service is old school but pretty attentive. Prices are quite reasonable in the grand scheme of things (brand + surging meat prices). This is the kind of steakhouse that everyone likes but not everyone will love. I'm in between but its NY and we're just spoiled for options.
1488,Went to Keens for a dinner. The ambience of the place is amazing. I think that's at least 3 sections each with different decor and set ups and a little different vibe but all unique and interesting. I was in the middle section between the bar and whatever the other section was. It felt cozy and warm and kinda old timey but in a good way. Order the signature lamb and sirloin. Both were made to the right temperature and seasoned very well. Would come back for a drink definitely
1489,"My first visit to keens on Jan 1 2022, celebrating the new year. We had reservations for 10:15 but they were ready for us at 9:45 when we arrived early. We dined in the lower level, it was adorned with pipes on the ceiling and older portraits. Because the mutton is well known to be delicious we tried the full size medium rare. It was huge! We also had oysters Rockefeller, mushrooms and a small filet (medium). I enjoyed my entire meal and we took a bit of mutton home. The service at keens was exceptional; attentive and warm. I will be returning.... 5 star!"
1490,"Well Mutton my Mutton!Keens Chophouse opened in 1885 by Mr. Albert Keen. Shocking but true, they did not allow women into the restaurant until 1905.Fast Forward to 2021, my son & I are dining at Keens while his fiancée and my wife are at Kleinfeld Bridal shop. Two New York institutions, yet only one serves bacon. Let's get this review underway!We're seated in the pipe room, a little darker and mysterious but still very cool. I tell my son it's his first time at Keens so you have to try the Mutton. He's hemming and hawing about it so finally I said, let's order one Mutton and one T-Bone for a taste comparison. For cocktails, I'm feeling a New York classic so for me I order a Gin Martini with olives. For my son, Old Fashioned. Two gentleman having gentleman drinks! The steakhouse bacon comes to the table. I have to say, this bacon is *better* than Peter Lugers! This is my personal opinion, I do love Peter Lugers steakhouse bacon but the Keens steakhouse bacon is less peppery. It's a smokey meat treat that's fun to eat!We finish our cocktails and have time to kill so I order a great bottle of red wine. The Keens wine list is very substantial. I'm reading the list, it's dark and I'm feeling pretty good. The wine bottles are numbered so be carefull! Thinking I ordered #217 which is an $80 bottle of wine but that was actually #216. #217 was a 2003 Chateau Lafite Rothschild for $1400. Imagine?I ordered the correct bottle of wine and as it was being poured, the steaks come to the table. The Mutton has a nice Au Jus on the plate, it's cut like a chop and sliced perfectly. If you like baby lamb chops, picture it in a steak chop. That best describes Mutton which pushes all the buttons. The T-Bone, honestly it wasn't the best I ever had. Great thick steak that was cooked perfectly. Where's the Au Jus? Peter Luger brings a sizzling plate to the table. Keens has a great steak but once again, IMHO not the best ever. As far as the pipe room, this is not a stuffy atmosphere. My son & I are sitting next to a family of 5 with teenagers in tow. I'm drinking vino in my red sports coat, I'm Mr Christmastime! I have nothing but love in my heart and the wine is making me feel very fine. My son says he could go for something sweet. Where can we get a matcha ice cream?? Son, NYC is my playground. Let's leave the pipe room and head over to K-Town for dessert.New York has so many great restaurants that are over 100 years old and Keens will be here long after I'm gone. What I can say is, in 2021 I was here enjoying the same Mutton as Frank Sinatra did in 1960. Start spreading the news.."
1491,"Went here with my Wife on Valentine's Daydecor / vibes / service = 5/5 : the place is so cool and feels really classy . The waiter was amazing, super professional and just accentuated the vibe. We were seated near the bar which I highly recommend because the bartender was so cool , and the old school mahogany wall really went well togetherFood: really disappointed here . appetizers were 5/5 , got the bacon and Cesar salad. however the mutton which I got medium rare was cooked well but honestly was lacking in flavor and bold character . I don't know just not what everyone claims it to be . my wife got the filet mignon medium well but it was a notch above well done and super dry .Wish my mutton chops were amazing so I can give this place a 5/5"
1492,"2 small mediocre crab cakes for $25 Even worse, bland tasting lobster bisque with 2 tiny pieces of ""lobster""Dunno how you screw up anything with lobster in it Watery espresso martinisThe service was ok-to-good, but the servers you can tell were not happy to be there and I definitely got some Stepford Wives/Get Out vibes from some of the staff"
1493,"My partner had wanted try Keens for a while so we decided to go for his birthday! We were able to get a 5:45 reservation on a Friday night without too much trouble by setting up an alert on Resy.Once we got there we were quickly seated upstairs. There were plenty of other diners, but the restaurant wasn't too loud or bustling. There was bread and butter, plus some crudités with a blue cheese sauce to start, and we ordered the porterhouse for two, creamed spinach, and mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious and service was prompt but not overbearing. The steak was excellent, though a teeny bit underseasoned for my taste, but perfect once I sprinkled a little more salt on it at the table. The creamed spinach was better than others I've had at similar steakhouses (you can actually taste the texture of the spinach leaves, which is my preference) and the potatoes were fluffy and buttery.We also got a slice of chocolate cake with a scoop of ice cream for dessert, which we polished off despite being pretty full already. The waitstaff was nice enough to light a candle on top of the cake since we were celebrating a birthday!Not a cheap meal, but we enjoyed Keens and would recommend for a night out or special occasion."
1494,"Amazing service Old money Steak one of the best in Manhattan Just one tip: if you like medium, order the steak med-wellI ordered medium rare it was mostly rare"
1495,"wow keens has officially taken the reign as my number 1 fave steak house. everything was just immaculate. came here for my late valentine's day dinner yesterday. i've never seen this but they start the table off with some bread and celery and carrot sticks! with their delicious blue cheese sauce. and a few olives and pickles! i honestly could've at all of that but told myself not to and save room for the main attraction lol. my uncle raved about the prime rib here so we had to get that and it did NOT disappoint !! although presentation kind of lacked it made up for it in flavor. the prime rib was soooo juicy and just had tremendously delicious beef flavor. just so good. had the leftovers today for dinner and still amazing !! we also got the prime sirloin, creamed spinach, hash brown, bacon and seafood tower. the best thing about keens is that their steaks actually taste dry aged ! i love that little funk on steaks and that's how i judge a good steak house. where you taste the dry aged and where the steak has such flavor without need any sauce. steaks were just so juicy and delicious. the seafood tower came with half a lobster, 4 shrimp cocktails and we asked to all oysters instead of clams and they were able to accommodate and i think had around 10 oysters total (forgot to count). everything was so fresh and cooked perfectly. the bacon order had 3 slices of bacon!! i was shocked cus i was just expecting one! also very solid. i loved the cream spinach when i think of creamed spinach this is what i think of. not over salty or too creamy. just perfect. the hash was not what i was expecting but still good it almost was mashed potato pan fried on both sides lol. again such a delicious meal and of course we had to end it off with dessert. we got the lady M chocolate cake was delicious so rich and not too sweet. along with the butterscotch sundae - so good but only critique too much cream on top. the touch of toasted almonds was the perfect touch. 10/10 for food! service was great too our waiter was super nice and just very pleasant. ambiance - we were downstairs it's a bit tight and pretty dark but overall no complaints really (: overall we will for sure be coming back. can't wait to come back to try the mutton chop and some of the other steaks!"
1496,"Keens for the win on Thanksgiving! My husband and I have been to Keens Steakhouse for drinks awhile back and we had always wanted to eat here, so we decided no better time than thanksgiving.The ambiance at Keens is very old school country club which I adore! The staff is super friendly and the food is delicious.The sides that were served during thanksgiving were amazing:-Deviled eggs -Crab cakes-Carrots and sweet potatoes -Mashed potatoes -Green beans and Brussels sprouts The deviled eggs originally were served three ways with meat and fish, however, the server was amazing and let me swap them out for all traditional due to the fact that I am vegetarian. For our main courses I had the vegetable Wellington which was the best thing I have ever tasted! And my husband had the filet which he said was cooked perfectly and served just the way he liked it.For dessert I had the apple crumble and my husband had the pecan pie, both desserts were great! We also shared a bottle of wine and some cocktails and everything was fabulous in the bar department.I cannot say enough about Keens Steakhouse and we both cannot wait to come back and try some of the regular menus items.Thanks for a great thanksgiving meal Keens!"
1497,"We had Valentine's Day dinner at Keens. We were greeted by the staff and were quickly shown to our seats. Complimentary bread/butter and vegetable sticks were served. The bread was not that great, average at best and it was served cold/room temperature so save the calories and skip it. The vegetables sticks (carrots and celery) were server whole so it was a bit awkward to eat, but the blue cheese dressing serverd with it was delicious  For appetizers we ordered the smoked bacon and seafood plate. The smoked bacon had a nice char and  great flavor. The seafood plate was a good but I had pieces of shell in the oysters so it wasn't a pleasant eating experience.For our main, we shared the mutton chop with a side of cream spinach. It was sooo good! The mutton was melt-in-your-mouth soft and not gamey at all. I can totally understand why they are famous for it. I wasn't a fan of the greens served with it though. I wasn't expecting them to be sour so it was quite a shock.For dessert, we opted for a slice of key lime pie and cappuccinos. I always appreciate a place that takes the time to do latte art. Anyways, the pie was decent, creamy with the perfect balance of sweet and tart. They also gave us complimentary chocolate truffles which were yummy as well.Overall our experience was good. I'd definitely recommend going and would love to go back to   actually try the steak this time haha"
1498,"I'm generally not a fan of stuffy steakhouse environments, as historic or iconic as they may be, so I probably would've never eaten here if it wasn't for a strong recommendation from my bf's manager. He was given a gift certificate of some sort, and we can't just NOT listen to the boss so we booked our dinner reservation over a month out. Now that I think of it, perhaps if we tried to dine outside instead of the traditional dining room, we would've somewhat avoided the stuffy environment that we don't like haha. Thankfully there was no dress code so it could've been worse.That being said, the service was truly impressive. No pretentiousness, just friendly and energetic vibes. Unfortunately we were sat between 2 very loud tables so that kind of killed the mood but of course not the restaurant's fault at all.Now for the FOOD: Of course we ordered the legendary mutton chop ($65) which was indeed SO GOOD and decently priced for the large portion that you get. The texture, char and flavor were all just perfect. We shared this dish as well as the Lobster & Filet Mignon ($74) which was also pretty good, but mutton chop way better. We had a couple of pieces of meat from both dishes that we couldn't finish, so bf made steak & eggs the next morning - he was in heaven.We also shared the soup of the day ($12) which was a tomato curry soup, the roasted market vegetables ($16) and the boiled baby potatoes ($12.50). We each got a glass of their homemade ginger ale ($5/each). Everything was delicious. We appreciated the complimentary bread basket and raw veggie platter/cheese dip as well. Overall a pleasantly surprising meal - I'd definitely recommend trying the mutton chop at least once in your lifetime."
1499,"Deeeelicious mutton chop that lives up to the hype - and for a pretty decent value (the portion size is HUGE). My husband and I celebrated his birthday here as a low-key yet indulgent dinner, and decided to check out Keens after hearing so many good things about their mutton chop. I didn't bother to try the other steak items here, so instead we each decided to get our own order of their signature dish as well as a side of creamed spinach. The verdict? The meat is SO tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked at medium rare. The flavor of the meat wasn't gamey, but just extremely savory. The vegetables that it came with (what looked like cooked romaine?) added the perfect acidic balance with its vinegary flavor. We didn't really need the creamed spinach (which was almost too heavy when paired with the mutton) and honestly we didn't need TWO mutton chops either. We had more than enough for a second meal of mutton the next day for lunch (it reheats extremely well in the oven, FYI).Service was efficient and quick. Also, I appreciated the additional element of crudités with blue cheese dipping sauce (yuuuuuum) along with the free bread--especially when some Midtown steakhouses are charging for bread baskets these days...Def get a reservation (was super easy on Resy)."
1500,"Ate here 2 nights in a row. The mutton.  Had the 'taste of mutton' which was a 10oz version of the bigger legendary chop I ate on night 2.  One night medium rare, the other medium.   Cooked perfect to the instructions.  The texture was similar to lamb, not like the mutton in Navajo country.  If you are accustomed to and like cuts of lamb with more fat that have the 'lamb' taste, like riblets, this chop is for you.  Forget mild flavors, I like my lamb to taste like lamb, my fish to taste fishy and my wild game to taste gamey.  Very historic building worth visiting just because.  The table was ready at the time, and our group of 3 was in and out in a little over an hour.  I like my fine dining like I do Confession: be brief, be blunt and be gone.  Bravo."
1501,"Made a reservation here for 9/11. No more fitting place to enjoy a dinner in uniform to pay respects to all those brave 343 we lost . Dinner was amazing and staff just the same! Kyle D was about as good as it gets! We trusted him to make a selection for our party. He brought all the food family style with plenty to eAt and to take home! Food was cooked perfectly, wine was perfectly poured, and ambiance was spectacular. The history behind this place is evident on the walls and ceiling. Staff was eager to explain the rich history behind Abraham Lincoln and it's affiliation to this restaurant. I would certainly come back here and I anxiously await that  day . Live laugh and remember all those we lost in 9/11"
1502,"Keens was the location to celebrate my 37th birthday. Upon arrival, I was immediately greeted, even outside by an employee, by the three employees who were in the front. I must say the staff here is 100% great, anytime you are in the proximity of a staffer, they would say hello. As my reservation was at 630PM and my 8 year old was with us, I wanted to order quickly, so we could kind of get in and get out. Collectively we ordered Lamb Chops, Filet Mignon, Roasted Chicken. For the sides, we had French Fries, Creamed Spinach and Mashed Potatoes. Our desserts options were the chocolate cake, cheesecake and something my daughter had called Bibble. It looked like a parfait/sundae, my daughter didn't care for it whatsoever. Onto the rest of the food, I wasn't pleased whatsoever with the food. The steak was tender, but just was bland. My daughter barely touched the chicken and she said that it lacked seasoning and she's 8. I attempted to reheat today, for lunch, but she still didn't really want it. The mashed potatoes were okay, as was the spinach, but nothing special. The location  is wonderful, the staff was exceptional, but the main attraction, the food itself, was very lackluster."
1503,"This place was so good! I'm just visiting from California, but was recommended this place! All the meats weee cooked so well and as asked, the cheesecake was delicious! We also got some wines and a sundae which did not disappoint! Definitely a must if you like steaks!"
1504,"I'll preface this by saying that it's hard for me to give five stars to a steakhouse. Like, you really have to blow my mind. Because there are a lot of good steakhouses...and this is one of them, yes. Was it mind-blowing? No. Would I say you HAVE to try it? No. But if you happen to find yourself here, you'll have a very good meal.We started with the ""twice baked Vermont blue cheese puff"" and crisp calamari salad. The calamari salad was FANTASTIC...I could have eaten an entree-size portion of that. The blue cheese puff was bizarre. When you hear the words ""cheese puff,"" don't you envision cheese wrapped in puff pastry? But no...this was just...fluffy cheese on a plate...and not all that remarkable, either. It was weird.My boyfriend had the mutton (because apparently you have to have the mutton at Keens), and I had the 8-ounce filet mignon with mushroom sauce (yummmmmm). The mutton was impressively good, despite not being a very attractive cut of meat. My filet was cooked perfectly to order (medium rare) and had a nice crust. It was an average steakhouse steak until dipped in the mushroom sauce, which made it amaaaazing...but I tried not to do that too much because I could tell the mushroom sauce was incredibly unhealthy, haha. (Right, I know; you don't go to a steakhouse to eat healthy...I know!)The sides were nothing to write home about, and that's definitely where Keens could put in some work to offer some more creative options (or at least more unique versions of the classic steakhouse sides).Desserts were fine (creme brulee and chocolate cake)...again, nothing amazing. But well done, definitely.Service was lovely, and we had a great bottle of wine."
1505,"Keehn's Steakhouse is well worth the hype every single time! Superb service, tasteful ambiance and unbelievable steak. This place is the best of the best!"
1506,"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! It's been a while since my last time and first time for my  friend. The purpose was to introduce them to this NY iconic, legendary steakhouse. First time though I have raw oysters there. Thus didn't fail me. Even in times of Covid ... fresh, excellent quality of dozen, mix East and West oysters. Delicious! Than we had the porterhouse for two... always a wining item! Medium rare! With baked potatoes and mushrooms side dishes. All made to perfection.Drinks kept coming and we had desert, berries with créme fraiche which was as refreshing as our server  promised. He was awesome too! Attentive, pleasant and  professional! The #1 steakhouse in MYC. If you love meat and understand steaks, this is the place for you!"
1507,"My brother and I ordered the mutton chop and the prime rib, and I must say that both were astounding! The mutton was incredibly tender and not gamey at all. It came with a jar of mint jelly that added a nice sweet touch. The prime rib was equally impressive. This incredibly fatty cut was served bone-in, so I enjoyed gnawing at the bone at the end of the meal. It was definitely on the milder side, so feel free to generously douse it all over this glorious slab of meat."
1508,Classic and historic steakhouse in NYC. Very glad I got to come here and experience the ambiance. Very nice steakhouse with delicious food and excellent service! The entire waitstaff was friendly and made several stops by our table to make sure we had everything we needed. The porterhouse for two was more than enough to share. The fries were also crispy and crunchy. Will definitely recommend this steakhouse to any friends making a trip to the city! Thank you for the delicious and memorable experience!
1509,"I wanted to give a better review as this place was and is I guess an institution in NYC steakhouses. I simply can't as the steak itself, the recommended sirloin, left quite a bit to be desired! Dry, lacking flavor it just didn't compare to some of the other top houses in the city. Sorry Keens. Also please if you can taste your house sauce to some others on the market. Needs more bite."
1510,Great selection and very helpful staff! Hours are good and seating in the summer is clutch. Great spot to meet up with people.
1511,"If I had to rival ample hills creamery to van Leeuwen, van leeuwen wins, however that doesn't mean these guys don't have solid ice cream. A wide range of flavors to choose from, amazing quality, tastes fantastic and will always hit the spot."
1512,"Great ice cream and shakes. Nice variety Of flavors. Can't go wrong with the brittle, cookies n' cream, and of course - vanilla."
1513,"If you love different flavored ice-cream with fancy names, this is for you. It is great ice cream, I'm told. My family attests to it. I take them there all the time. But not me. I don't enjoy their ice cream. Limoncello blah blah or sorbet blah blah doesn't do it for me. (I could be getting them confused with gelato). To my taste, they just don't have enough citrus flavored choices. In an interview from 2014, the original owners explained their focus on flavors. And admitted that they never really focused on citrus flavors. wnyc.org/story/ample-hil…Salted cracked caramel? Cookies & Cream? Go at it. Something lemony and old school? Monteleone's on Court or Fortunato Brothers on Manhattan Avenue to start."
1514,Ample Hills is my favorite ice cream shoppe. Their summer of love is without a doubt their best flavor!
1515,Love the ice cream. great flavors and service
1516,"My first time here. I was looking for a sweet treat while I was visiting the brooklyn botanical garden and this place popped up on my search. wow let me tell you as soon you get inside the store the smell is absolutely amazing is like heaven, you can smell the freshness of milk and sugar and cookies. Will definitely be coming here again soon.."
1517,"Okay, it's not the original owners :( but as always, the ice cream is great (yay chocolate milk and cookies and peppermint pattie). Lots of creative flavors, most with mix-ins. It's worth the price, worth the wait in line, worth eating ice cream in the winter, etc."
1518,"I had heard really great things about this place for ice cream, and they did not disappoint. There was a line when we stopped by on a warm Saturday afternoon, but it moved pretty quickly and I appreciate how they enforce social distancing by only letting a few people in at a time / having hand sanitizer available at the register.They have a load of interesting flavors, and I appreciate that they have milkshakes/vegan flavors as well! I went with the PB Wins the Cup -- the small cup size along with a sugar cone on top. It definitely hit the spot; if you really like creamy ice cream, then I think you'd really like this! Not to mention, the illustrations are freakin' adorable."
1519,"I mean what's not to love about an ice cream shop??? I mean ample hills is a staple and their ice cream is always so delicious you can't go wrong. I always get the Sweet honey because it's so good, not overly sweet. I always try to buy a pint at a time whenever I get a cone so I have some for later too. What's nice is that if you get a pint you don't have to get a pre-packaged one they'll scoop out a pint for you. I decided to get a pint of the sweet honey but then I got a scoop of the nonnas oatmeal cookie ice cream and let me tell you - I was this close to getting a pint of that too. It tastes exactly like an oatmeal cookie and has pieces of oatmeal cookies in it too. It's SOOOO good. My friend got the mango sherbet ice cream and loved that too. I mean seriously you can't go wrong with any flavor you choose. Since you can't do tasting right now because of COVID you won't go wrong with any flavor."
1520,"They do a really great job at all their locations of ensuring you feel safe, even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Employees are super friendly, wearing masks and gloves and they have ample (haha) hand sanitizer available. In our household, it's become a birthday ritual to order ice cream cakes for one another from here. This year, we obviously had to order the smaller version but they did a great job of getting it ready on time with the accurate order. Munchies is my favorite flavor :) highly recommend if you're a salty sweet fan. Ample hills will be our favorite ice cream shop forever!"
1521,"Very nice staff. I found the ice cream to be much too sweet and the simple flavors of good ingredients were drowned out.  Also, I found them to be very expensive for whats offered.  1 X Kiddie scoop 1 X Small Scoop = $12+And there is a request for tip on the terminal. I think the combination of poor quality and high price makes it hard to justify a revisit."
1522,"This places makes it seem like ice cream should be required for every meal. Not only are they consistent with flavor from place to place but they are great service. While maintaining a friendly hipster vibe, this place really highlights each area with a signature ice cream. So it is worth it to stop in everyone you pass and ask for that particular one."
1523,Great flavors and ingredients. Great service. Great experience! Great spot for families or for solo sweet runs.
1524,"Im from Long Island and my boyfriend is from Brooklyn, i wanted to see where he grew up and he took me to this place he used to go as a kid. I love sweets and this place has some pretty cool combinations to there ice cream will definitely be going back for more."
1525,"We used to love coming to this place and eating crack caramel flavor, but then they did not have it.  I noticed that the ice cream selections were missing nuts in the ice cream (hazel nut, coconut, pecan, almonds).  I tried pistachio, the only ice cream in stock that had nuts.  It was too sugary, no flavor of pistachio.  I don't want to try anything else, as during Covid I don't want to experiment trying flavors inside, where I have to take my mask off.We stood in line for 1 hour.Would not recommend. They changed owners and things changed for the worst.A better ice cream can be bought in a store with better flavor."
1526,Amazing authentic ice cream with creative flavors. There's something for everybody. Try the Nonna D's Oatmeal Lace.
1527,"Review during COVID:I was checking Ample Hills Instagram account to monitor when they would be open and alas, last weekend they announced they would be open.I quickly proceeded to bike over there on Sunday as I had been dreaming of the Munchies for months.The place was open, with only a few people allowed in at a time and a line outside.I ordered a cone with the munchies and the snapmallow pop flavors, and my partner got the mango and Gowanus flavors in a pretzel cone (which isn't typically at the Vanderbilt location, and he claims is his favorite flavor).The munchies 5/5 is one of my all-time favorite ice cream flavors. It's got the perfect texture with a hint of salt and a vanilla sweet base. All I can say is that when someone asks me what my favorite ice cream shop is, ample hills is always the first place that comes to mind."
1528,"Busy ice-cream spot with unique flavors and well-priced.Ample Hills on a beautiful Saturday afternoon had about a 15 minute line out the door but was well worth the wait. Menus were distributed while waiting which I appreciated because they have such a wide and interesting list of flavors. Unfortunately they were out of the ""munchies"" choice by the time I decided, but that just made my choice easier in going with the dark chocolate gowanus scoop.The ice cream sounded so fancy and rich with hazelnut cookies and orange flavors-- it was certainly delicious but I didn't notice the fancy notes as much as I thought I would. Still an amazing scoop of ice cream for $5.5!Friendly service, social-distancing practiced, and a few outdoor tables."
1529,"What's not to love? The ice cream is the perfect balance of creamy, lightly sweetened ice cream. I always get a different combination but they have great suggestions on the menu."
1530,My roommie got Mango sorbet with salted crack caramel and I got strawberry with baked/unbaked. Both delicious and would get it again
1531,Not even close to the quality of what it was when it first started.Not worth the hype.
1532,"This is an ice cream place with tons of fun flavors. Gowanus got a flavor named  after the area!  The icecream is actually made here!  How much local can you get! Special flavors for the  the holidays too, Lights!  All the  flavors I have tried are fun!  It's a little costly per pint but worth the price."
1533,"BUTTER PECAN BRITTLEBrown sugar ice cream with homemade pecan brittleOoooh, no wonder @zagat voted #AmpleHillsCreamery the #1 ice cream in #NYC during #2016The ice cold temperature and flirtatious textures of the course pecans and crisp brittle are ALL complimented by the super sweet smooth butter flavor mixed in the cream‼What a way to spend the last few days of outside enjoyment consuming frozen treats under the heat of the #summer17 sun  .#MyHungryWorld#SkinnyGirlsLuvFood2#icecream @amplehills#Brooklyn#excellent #customerservice#childfriendly"
1534,"One of my favorite ice cream spots in BK! Rich flavors and a nice vibe. Go , it's a good time."
1535,Highly recommend the PB flavor of ice cream!! They make their peanut butter cups in house and it's delicious!!
1536,bourgeois garbage. i'm never going to pay even 2/3 that price for an ice cream cone. keep capitalism out of my summer treats . two stars cause i got a couple free samples and he tasty
1537,Amazing ice cream. It's definitely the creamiest ice cream I ever and it's not pricey either. I wish that they followed instructions on Uber Eats better so that I could get the exact two flavors I wanted but the ones that came in my cup were my back up flavors so they were really tasty as well.
1538,Ice cream was so good! The price was pretty reasonable too. Definitely recommend--will be back for more scoops.
1539,My favorite ice cream brand.Get ya'll stuff together. But all the flavors mg mouth can dream of happens here.
1540,Great ice cream and great location. I love the seasonal flavors. Beware of long lines!!
1541,"Bomb ice cream, super rich and flavorful. Two flavors per kids or single scoops, woo. Three stars because out of my Ooey Gooey Butter Cake and It Came from Gowanus scoops I got one chunk of cake. Chunks in my ice cream is the best part!! But I didn't get a single ""chunk"" of orange-scented brownies, hazelnut crack'd cookies or white chocolate pearls from my Gowanus chocolate scoop, sad."
1542,"Best ice cream in Brooklyn. Creamy, delicious, and original flavors. The shop itself is homey and the staff is (usually) very lovely. There's lots of families and children that come into the shop. It's a tad expensive, but now, what isn't in Brooklyn anymore?  I'll always be an Ample Hills fan."
1543,So good! Highly recommend trying the sampler where you can try multiple different flavors!
1544,The ice cream is fresh and creamy The location is accessible to MTA only bus. If prepared to walk from Clinton Washington stop from the C train you will be fine about a 15 minute walk. Unless you take the B69 bus which is slow as a snail.
1545,"Great ice cream, smooth and worth the wait. Sometimes the wait is a little long but ice cream is very good. I recommend"
1546,"Ample Hills has been around forever, and in my opinion, is one of the great ice cream places in the area. They have a diverse list of flavors and vegan options that hit the spot! Staff/service is great and generous with their scoops, and the atmosphere is so welcoming and whimsy! Love everything about it!"
1547,Brought the kiddos here and they fell in love with the Ice cream here! I highly recommend coming here! Will definitely be going back with my kids! TRY THE VANILLA ICE CREAM! Very creamy
1548,"I went to this ice cream place today, the customer service was great. The ice-cream it self is delicious but the flavor I got is really sweet. It has cookie dough in it. I highly recommend this place!!"
1549,"Simply delicious! I love their Vanderbilt Ave location It brings back fond memories of going there when my kids were small. Riding on that bike in the window, so fun! A must visit in Prospect Heights."
1550,"Came again after 2.5 years and it is just as good as I remember! Had ""the munchies"" again which is quite filling due to all the things in the mix. Also had a scoop of Ooey Gooey Butter cake which was quite sweet but was nice because it had pieces of cake and complemented ""the munchies"" well.Overall, recommend."
1551,"What can I say? It's creamy! Delicious and Different  flavors and it doesn't bother my tummy... which is best part.Being an Almond milk drinker with mostly everything, when i want to indulge in some grass fed milk I come here! my favorite is pistachio and butter pecan!"
1552,"Recently was invited here for a birthday party. Cute little spot located on the corner. So this is where it gets tricky and why I took one Star away. When you first walk in it has a damped wet smell. Which was a little nauseating to me, who knows maybe it just me but that's what I smelled. So that's that and I'm glad I got that out the way. Now let me finish with the review. The party Host oh boy he was just awesome , patient, energetic, entertaining and hilarious. He was very patient and explained everything in detail for a 5 year old little person to understand. What makes this place unique is definitely the bicycle that sits in the middle of the store that you get to sit on and paddle to help in the process of making your own ice cream. So I'm not big on ice cream but I did taste some of my daughters ice cream and it was definitely yummy."
1553,"It's good ice cream, sure. So 4 stars. The ice cream itself is different than, say, Ben & Jerry's, but it's not better. And you can pick up B&J at your local supermarket. But it IS good ice cream. For that final 5th star, it would have to be spectacular ice cream, or offer some sort of unusual and unique experience, and it doesn't. So definitely above average, but not at the very top of the star chart."
1554,One of ice cream spots that i keep coming to over and over. I usually get one every few days and can never get tired of the flavors.
1555,"Ice cream is super fresh, inventive and delicious. I've been coming for over a decade and it never disappoints. Although I'm basic and stick with sweet cream and cookies, other favorites include ooey gooey butter cake, coffee and cookies and king of mangoes. Hugely better than van leeuwen which opened not too long ago across the street. I appreciate that you can get pints fresh filled here and split it in half between flavors."
1556,"Thank you to this amazing family and their amazing business!! I used to teach their daughter, Nonna, science, and got to chat with her mom each day. What a nice family! So humble, and WOW, so talented at creating Ice Cream. This ice cream is out of this world. I'm so thrilled to now see them across the U.S., including Disney World!"
1557,"Fabulous ice cream... We had different flavors (salted caramel, vanilla, raspberry, pistachio) Price seems to be high but by the time we finished our ice cream and we were very very satisfied... Well worth it... It kept us at bay the whole night... That's a great dessert!"
1558,"I love ice cream so much it might not even be fair for me to be reviewing this place, but it is so great I could eat here every day. They sell pints in the grocery store now but there's nothing like getting a cone at the shop. So many great flavors, you really can't go wrong."
1559,Overly conceived overly priced bourgeois ice cream. I got a small ice cream cone and a water ... $10 !!! I'd much rather buy a pint of Ben & Jerry's at my local supermarket for $5 !!! Read the story about how greed destroyed original owners' company on Medium app.
1560,I LOVE THIS PLACE SO MUCH!!!I understood the hype of NY bagels through Ess-a-Bagel. The wait in line is worth even if it's rounding the corner and takes almost an hour to get in. Just make sure you know what you want when you order -- saves time! I will definitely be thinking more about these bagels than any other food I've eaten during my 2-week trip in NY! I miss these bagels already
1561,"I was so looking forward to coming back to ess a bagel after not coming here since 2017, but my visit this time was a huge disappointment. There are major operational inefficiencies that can be easily improved to decrease in person waiting times, but it's clear nobody has invested in the customer experience. And even after waiting in line for an hour on a Sunday afternoon, two of our bagel sandwiches were missing cream cheese. Lastly, the cashier was extremely rude and sarcastic to two customers in front of us for absolutely no reason. It seemed nobody wanted to be there and nobody cared about the customers. Will not be coming back here and would recommend Best Bagel and Coffee to others searching for a better New York bagel."
1562,"YUM!! NYC bagels are famous for a reason and Ess-a-Bagel does it right. You can tell by their line going out the door and down the street during most open hours! But don't worry, they crank out the bagels so the line moves fast.They have a variety of bagels from just cream cheese to adding meats and cheese, so regardless if you're a sweet or savory person you'll find something you like!I first stopped by and got an everything bagel with turkey, egg, and cheese. Trust me when I say they do NOT skimp out on the meat. I had to come back a second time and go for a cream cheese, so I got an everything bagel with herb and enjoyed it even more than the first bagel! You just can't beat that classic combo. This place is well known for good reason and many locals confirmed it's one of the best spots in NYC. Only downside is I wanted to get a merch hat as a souvenir of my trip, but they didn't have any in stock, bummer!"
1563,"First New York bagel ever, and it did not disappoint! First off, I ran into two content creators in line which was insane. Waited for about 15 minutes for my toasted everything bagel with jalapeño cream cheese and it was to die for!They say there is something in the water of New York that makes it's bagels so good but I genuinely think ess-a-bagel has something in their water specifically that makes their bagels so addicting. This is definitely my go-to bagel place whenever I hit up the city, from now on!"
1564,"This place is still one of the best bagel joints in NYC.   The line early Sunday morning was still out the door because of how popular this place is.   But it's not just popular, it's great.   The bagels have a great chew.   I love their pumpernickel bagels but the sesame bagel is also great.   Def worth the wait and definitely worth coming back."
1565,"Be aware that the lines on the weekend are quite long. It's best to order ahead online and pick it up in an hour rather than just stand around! However, be mindful that it seems like they stop taking online orders around 11AM on the weekend.If I were to sum it up in one word it'd be overhyped. The bagels are average, the flavored cream cheese taste only like cream cheese, and the portions are wildly inconsistent. I went consecutive days and the amount of scallion cream cheese that I received was so drastically different it was laughable. Not to mention, there was barely any scallions. The Signature Favorite barely has any salmon. Instead, they add extra tomato to make it look like the portion is larger than it actually is."
1566,Est. Since 1976.Such a great bagel place with a variety of options.I ordered the signature favorite with everything bagel. A steep price for one bagel but it is worth it. You can have two meals if you are not a big eater like myself.Made to order in front of you with fresh ingredients Prepare to wait in for a line for at least half an hour. But you won't regret this.
1567,"One of the best bagel place I have ever been to. They have sooooo many spread options, it's very overwhelming but I loved it. Their bagel was also very fresh but it's not that cheap but it's worth it. There is always a line, I waited about 15 minutes to get my bagel but it was good! :)"
1568,"This is a true NYC bagel, and it's what I came for. Although the line looks long, it moves pretty quickly. I had the everything bagel with lox and cream cheese (the signature favorite), which is made sandwich style vs open faced. The bagel was the perfect amount of dense with a crispy outside but soft and chewy inside. The salmon was thin and melted in your mouth. Yum."
1569,"Dear Ess-A-Bagel,Someone from Tampa, Florida really just described the bagel I grew up on as a total waste of time and energy. But this isn't for me. I know the bagel that got me through middle school history class in the afternoons is worth all the time in the world. Because I've already spent a good amount of time eating it over the years.I also realize that you must know you have a damn good bagel. Really I just wanted to say hello and thank you for all those bagels with lox and the works that you've fed me over the years.You truly have a wonderful product that obviously has stood the test of time. From the crunchy exterior, to the tempurpedic-like doughy interior, everyone in the world should put aside their time and energy to enjoy one of your bagels.All the best in the name of food.- Yelpman"
1570,I loathe waiting in lines and wondered how good can a bagel be? boy... these bagels are seriously the best bagels I've ever had. Usually they're dense and I can only eat them toasted and with cream cheese but they were hot out of the oven and it was so good I just ate an everything bagel plain without any cream cheese or accoutrements on my drive back down to Baltimore. I like bread but I do not reach carb fiend levels unless it's a well done baguette and apparently a hella good New York bagel.
1571,"Famous bagel place in NY that always has a line. I recently developed a love for NY bagels so I was excited to try this place. We waited for maybe 45min on a Sunday morning. The staff inside kept telling people that were waiting in line to ""not order online, just keep waiting - it's faster this way"". So yeah, don't be that person. We got avocado cream cheese with everything bagel, sundries tomato tofu with pumpernickel bagel, and friend got the lox spread bagel. I was very disappointed with their tofu spread. It was flavorless and the tofu taste was too strong. I just ate the bagel instead. I had the tofutti from Absolute Bagel and it was amazing - nothing compared to this one. Highly suggest to avoid all their tofu options. The pumpernickel bagel is made from rye flour so it'll have some minty taste. Keep that in mind while paring with with a spread. The avocado cream cheese which is a recent new flavor - tasted artificial. Wasn't a big fan... felt like it was just missing something? Their bagels itself was also very boring - tasted nothing special. A bit too tough for my taste.My friend said the lox bagel tasted much better after you microwaved it. This way the bagel is more chewy. My favorite bagel place is still Absolute Bagel, this place didn't live up to the hype. Also felt like it's become a tourist trap. Their bagels are a bit overpriced in my opinion. They do have good deals on Too Good to Go though! Overall: gross tofu spread, avocado cream cheese was strange , average bagels, not worth the long wait (maybe order online for pick up), overpriced"
1572,"I didn't get to visit in person (yet) but I was so lucky to try the bagels special delivered to me same day in Dallas!! They were delicious and I loved the crunch and delicious flavors. We had a couple dozen and loved all the flavors!! Super crisp, fresh and they have a great variety. Next time I'm in NYC I will make it a must-visit spot!!!"
1573,"First thing you need to know: if you're just getting bagels - like just picking up a baker's dozen - don't wait in line, go straight in to the back. The line is for people ordering sandwiches/prepared bagels etc. Better yet, order delivery.I'm much more a Montreal-style bagel fan than a New York-style bagel fan, but I definitely love Ess-A-Bagel - just a simple poppy seed toasted with butter and cream cheese does it for me, though there's a whole lot of good options.I wouldn't recommend waiting in line too long, but if it's not around the corner, you won't be too long."
1574,"This normally is my favorite bagel place, but this last time, I went- it was one of the worst bagels and experiences I've ever had. I don't know what happened. Staff did not ask any of us about toasted or not toasted. Then they told me I could pay for another $12 bagel to get a toasted mini bagel. I received this poor excuse of a bagel and someone else in party got a bagel with no cream cheese even though it says on the menu, it comes with cream cheese. Such terrible customer service when we asked to get our orders fixed."
1575,Hheelloooo best bagel I've had in a WHILE - fluffy chewy flavorful perfect texture and this place has every single topping under the sun from avocado garlic cream cheese to Oreo cream cheese and all in between - yep you heard me right ! All the fishes and pre made salads we had were delish- jalapeño tuna is NOT to be missed !!!!
1576,"A FILLING meal! If you're looking for a breakfast place that serves a classic nyc bagel it doesn't get better than this. Ended up getting a signature bagel on a everything bagel which included nova and loxs. This meal could easily feed 2 people. The bagel sandwich was loaded with lettuce, tomatoes, and a scallion spread. Would definately recommend this spot!"
1577,"Consistently included in many ""Top 4 Bagels in NYC"" lists and conversations. I don't personally have a ranked list but I know Ess-a-Bagel's lox sandwich is definitely up there somewhere."
1578,"If New York is the bagel central, then Ess-a-Bagel proudly represents. The line to this place is huge which means it's good - locals and tourists alike dawn this place for tasty food. The bagels are all so plump and fluffy and chewy, absolutely delicious. Every single bite is like heaven.Also the cream cheese selection is massive, you name it, they got it. There's also so many unique flavors - peach, red velvet, avocado to name a few. I love that they have vegan options if spread made from tofu! Although you con't be convinced that it's the real deal, the tofu definitely has similar flavor and a similar consistency.There were so many options I had so a hard time narrowing down what I wanted, but I got the LEO (lox, egg and onion) on an everything bagel toasted with scallion tofu. I wish that I got more lox. I felt like I just got a thin slice, but the whole bagel was delicious. The spread was so airey abs balanced so well with the denser bread an the onions and egg. I can't wait to come back and try one of their many more options."
1579,"Just another tourist reviewing one of the best bagels they've ever had -- take it or leave it.  First of all, when I say I waited an HOUR for a lox bagel and egg and sausage bagel -- I truly waited that long.  But here's the thing, it wasn't just tourists in line, there were locals, transplants, you name it.  This place makes some legit bagels.  Plump, crispy outside and fluffy, but chewy insides.  And can we talk about the cream cheese options?  It felt like there were hundreds!  The line takes some time, so figure out what you're gonna get BEFORE you get to the counter.  Seriously, the staff is on a roll, and don't have time for you to ask questions or contemplate -- yeah, it's kinda intimidating, but hey, it's NYC.As far as seating, it's super limited so plan on eating elsewhere, though you may luck out and snag a one of the few small tables inside.PRO TIP: Skip the line and order ahead online BEFORE you get there.  That way you can show up, go straight to the cashier and tell them your order's name.  Are you just ordering plain bagels?  Go inside and head straight towards the back where you can order a bag of plain, non-sandwich/cream cheese bagels then go straight to the cashier!See more photos and reviews on my food Instagram, @sammychews!"
1580,"This place is another reminder to me that I don't like bagels no matter how ""amazing"" the spot is. It's probably my least favorite type of bread.The sausage egg and cheese bagel was under seasoned and the bagel were hard. Honestly I think people will love this place if you like bagels but for someone like me it was a miss but I had to give it a shotOk price and staff"
1581,"Ess-a-Bagel is a must when in New York City.  Long lines do not lie.  Walking in to the delicious aroma of what they had to offer was well worth the wait.  We had a bagel and egg sandwich with sausage, along with a regular bagel with cream cheese and a black and white cookie.  Everything was awesome.  Besides bagels, they offer dessert items and other pastry options.  I highly recommend Ess-a-Bagel when in New York City.  You will not regret it."
1582,"Can we talk about the insanity the line for Ess-a-Bagel? We got to Ess-a-Bagel around noon on a Sunday and waited for an 1.5 hours for our bagels. Granted the line was out the door and the line indoors was packed but boy did it move slowly. I thought Bagels were a quick meal but honestly we probably could have got to a sit down restaurant at the pace they were going through the line. Not sure if its faster to order online or order delivery?I got the BLTA and bf Chicken Parmigiana Sandwich and the Egg Sandwich. We ordered all the bagels on an everything bagel. The bagel was pretty good, which was a redeeming quality of this place. The Everything Bagel was decorated with flakes salt which I like on my Everything Bagel and it is often something not all places do. The bacon was crispy and the avocado was nice. The bagel itself was nicely done- crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It is a flatter bagel than most but it was really good. After we finished eating, the line for Ess-a-Bagel was pretty short (1:30/2 pm) so I'd try to avoid the lunch rush. Overall, pretty decent place for a bagel in NYC 3.5/5 rounded up for the food. If you are visiting it would be nice to try this place out but I wouldn't waste your vacation time waiting in line. There are probably better bagel places in NYC. I would probably almost never grab a bagel during peak hours if I lived in the area."
1583,"The best breakfast place! We waited in line for an hour but it was well worth the wait. I would order online and and plan ahead, as the wait will likely be an hour+ long. The signature favorite is well deserving of its name, although I might ask them to go light on the red onions next time. The bagel was deliciously toasted-- crispy on the outside but perfectly doughy and chewy on the inside. Can't wait to be back for more!"
1584,Honestly just an overhyped bagel place. It's just a bagel and nothing that special. Got the avocado garlic spread on an everything bagel and my bf got the signature (not pictured) which included salmon and it was alright. Sure come to NY and try a bagel place just to say you tried it but really no different than any other bagel place. Lines are ridiculous on the weekends (went on a Saturday). Do yourself a favor and order online for pickup an hour after (so you should time this properly cause it really does take an hour for it to be ready since they probably prioritize the people in line).
1585,Delicious bagels.. got the signature with everything bagel bread.. ordered for pick up to skip long line! Wouldn't wait in a long line for a bagel though
1586,"Some of the largest bagels I've had in a long time. The Egg & Cheese Sandwich, Plain bagel, and Cinnamon Raisin bagel were all delicious, but I do wish all three had been toasted more as they got to be a little too chewy. The Signature Bagel (Everything bagel) was great, but definitely a mouthful. The only other real disappointing part of the meal was the Oreo cream cheese, which just came off as a slightly sweeter regular cream cheese."
1587,"Always heard NY has the best bagels and I can finally say it's true! By far the best bagels I've had. They're soft, not crumbly, moist and slightly bouncy, and soooooo good toasted. There was a line out the door on a Monday morning. Best to plan ahead to give yourself extra time for the wait which was about 30 min if you're getting bagel sandwiches. If you're getting whole bagels without needing them sliced or toasted, you can go through the single left side door and order there. Will definitely be back!"
1588,The line was pretty short when we walked in but it took us a while to order because there were so many cream cheese options. They also had a wide assortment of pastries. The bagels are pretty filling and they don't skimp on toppings. I liked it and would come again.
1589,"Good, not great.Someone else on Yelp said it pretty much perfectly - glad I went, glad I tried it, wouldn't do it again.Not because the bagels aren't really great - they are.  Got myself the Signature Favorite (salmon, scallion cream cheese, tomato, onions and capers) and was well satisfied with the taste and with the sheer quantity of food.  Just half of it was enough to fill me up - their Black and White cookie was the perfect dessert, and it went down well with a cup of fresh Orange Juice.The problem is the wait-time.  In a city that's famous for great bagels, there's no reason you should wait in a line that snakes all the way out the door, for 20-30 minutes at least, for a good bagel.This specific spot is famous for being one of their flagship, OG bagel cafes and I've never walked by here without seeing a ton of tourists flocked around it.Yesterday after years of waiting, I saw that the line wasn't as crazy as usual, but still ended up waiting about 30 minutes before I got my food.Staff are friendly, food is good, prices are OK.  So if you're in the area and miraculously don't see a huge line, give 'em a try for sure."
1590,"Came here on our first day in Manhattan and was the line long! Every time I've been here or walked by it I always see a line, so come prepared with something to drink especially if it's hot outside. We both ordered the signature favorite and loved it. The bagel is fresh and delicious, and the smell inside the bagel shop was heavenly. Managed to find a table inside also to enjoy the bagel in AC peace, and it was nice to see that with how busy it is people don't really linger at their tables since there's maybe 4 or 5 tables total inside, and no tables outside. It is pricey per bagel, more than other shops we went to, but I also don't feel they were cheap with the food used and that everything was fresh with a healthy portion of salmon in our sandwich. Will def be back in the future."
1591,"The bagel sandwiches here are decent but I've had similar elsewhere. Yes, there seems to often be a line but don't use that as a measure of quality, it's really because the establishment is slow as molasses with their production line model of taking your orders, preparing your food, and then having it rung up by the cashier (and as for the latter, they totally need more than 1 cashier).My Whitefish Pumpernickel Raisin bagel was pretty good tho - nice blend of flavors! Pastrami & Cheese on an Everything Bagel was yummy too but the only dissatisfactory portion is the fact that they upcharged me for my Havarti Cheese request yet put American Cheese on the sandwich - so misleading!Cashier didn't even say ""thank you"" once I paid for my order. Being as though NYC is the bagel capital, there's too many other options with better service, less wait time, and a cheaper menu. I'll def be going elsewhere next time I have a bagel craving!"
1592,Came here on a Saturday morning and the line was quite long.  It took us close to an hour to actually get the bagels.  I do think the bagel though was worth the wait.  We ordered the signature favorite and it was loaded with Salmon and cream cheese.  Definitely on the pricier side but it was good and tasted very fresh
1593,"After taking a red eye flight to NYC, I took advantage how early I am ""up"" to check popular places like these. But even then, it was so packed at 7am weekday - not as crazy of a wait as other reviews, but still a solid 10 min from a line of 25 people. I got A Signature Favorite which has lox (smoked salmon), capers, onion, lettuce, tomato, and scallion cream cheese, served with choice of bagel (my go-to is always the everything bagel, though the poppy is fairly popular here). It's delicious and is better than something I'd make, but it's not almost-$17 delicious. Portions are actually smaller than what I expected for the price. It's great you get the option to toast the bagel, so the bagel has a light crunch and brings out the flavor of the herbs. The ingredients themselves are really fresh. The tomato can be a bit of an illusion to make it seem like they give generous amounts of lox - they kind of do, but not the amount that would justify a high price tag.Overall, this is a solid bagel spot, good to try once, and is more catered towards tourists. A friend went to a local deli to grab a $10 smoked salmon bagel of similar size and of similar quality, though this place does have a ""vibe"" that makes people willing to check it out for the experience. Besides, they have so many cream cheese spreads to choose from, including rainbow!"
1594,"Ess-a-Bagel! My love! What I looked forward to every other day when I lived a few blocks away :') this place drains my bank account, but it's worth it. After trying many, many places in NY, I continuously go back to Ess-a-Bagel for my standard lox everything bagel with cream cheese (the ""Signature Favorite"")-- hnnngggg. - The bagel: chewy, fresh, not too dry or dense in any way. - The toppings: very generous, fresh, a diversity of texture and tastes. THE EVERYTHING BAGEL HAS TOPPINGS ON BOTH SIDES (imagine them using 2 bagel ""tops"") WHICH IS INCREDIBLE. - The staff: nice, but no nonsense (classic NYC). Know what you want and be succinct about it! The not-so-great-but-not-that-bad-because-I'm-still-giving-5-stars: - The PRICE. $15 is a lot for a single bagel sandwich.  - The wait. This eatery used to be on my way to the subway station, and every time I passed by the line was ridiculously long and everyone looked miserable.Pro tip: - ORDER FOR PICKUP OR DELIVERY, so you don't have to stand in that giant line. (They offer free local delivery for orders over $20). This may mean that you have to plan your order a while before you actually get there, but it's worth it to save your time and your mental health. Also, you get the added bonus of silently (or not silently, whatever your style is) evil-laughing as you cut everyone in line. I've since moved out of NYC, but during my next visit Ess-a-bagel will definitely be my first stop."
1595,"Bucket List Accomplishment:- Pay $15 for a bagel The crispiest, yummiest, and most satisfying bagel I've ever had! Got the signature favorite, and it blew me away. The outside the the perfect amount of crunch, and it makes for a satisfying bite. Each ingredient in this bagel comes through (Never thought I would appreciate lettuce in a bagel). The lox melts away in your mouth. Worth the 30 minute wait and the bucket list price point."
1596,"Bagels are probably one of my favorite foods and I know that every time I go to New York, I have to get a bagel. Ess-a-bagel did not disappoint. I always opt for the classic bagel combo- lox, tomato, onion, capers, and cream cheese. I dont get my bagel with lettuce because it just doesn't really add anything for me and gets in the way. Th bagel itself was crispy on the outside but super soft and pillowy in the middle. They definitely dont skimp out on the toppings here either. My friends and I liked this place so much that we came back a second time right before our flight home and I even bought a half dozen of bagels to bring back to the west coast with me. Will probably end up coming back to New York just for the bagels tbh"
1597,"Best bagels. Ess-a-Bagel is a classic. It has too many good things to choose from here. Certainly bagels but also the many spreads are what really make these good. There's also coffee and deli sides. Go here to make your morning better. It has an old school feel to it. There's always a line. It means people like it. They have the typical stuff you expect at any bagel place. It's just so much better than the others. They have some good filling bagels that are the perfect area between crispness and softness. It's about $6 for a bagel with a spread, which is kind of a lot but they really load it up, and of course it's also excellent. They have the tofu vegan cream cheese that seems to be at most bagel places. If you can wait then go here for the best bagels. Lines luckily move pretty fast. Try coming here at a less busy time and try some of the deli sides too."
1598,"Came here to experience a New York bagel, found this place on Yelp with great reviews. We waited in line for about 40 minutes as the line moved very very slow. When it was our turn we felt rushed by the employee. The pizza bagel was not good at all, I have had better at Western bagel. I ordered a sesame bagel with jalapeño cream cheese and the cream cheese tasted like nothing. We also ordered a bagel with strawberry cream cheese that we didn't even end up eating as none of it tasted good. Disappointed in the bagels and the amount of time we spent waiting in line. The bagels were very hard."
1599,"Everything you read about the line is true. Anytime after 9am it seems like you can expect a steady 45-90 minute wait. With this being said, the hack seems to be to order online for pickup ahead of time. Logistics wise, there is no where to dine at the location aside from a 4 small tables that are extremely competitive (near impossible?) to get.I got the bacon, egg, and pepperjack on an everything bagel.. the bagel was awesome, but there wasn't enough egg, and hardly any pepperjack. In addition, we got a cinnamon raising bagel, toasted with butter which was delicious.Overall, I'd say the wait makes the bagels not all that worth it; however if ordering ahead for pickup works well, this will likely be my favorite NYC spot."
1600,"Yep! It's good. That catfish basket!!!! You must try it. Wow!!Since I am not a crawfish fan. I ordered the full snow crabs (main). Was a lot larger than expected. I could not finish and took more than half home. Super worth the price $48. The combos sound good but the pairing and weight of the main shellfish...Not so good. I suggest choosing a main. Also a heads up...if you are not into old bay, don't order the lobster roll. The lobster meat is mixed in with a lot of old bay. A lot.The non alcoholic drinks  were so delicious. I had a lemonade passionfruit and my friends ordered some lychee cocktail. Very suiting with the meal.The outdoor seating is kind of nice too. Separated by plexis and heated. I would have enjoyed sitting outside but, it was a brisk evening."
1601,"Came here with a friend on a weekday night for a party of two and we were seated right away. What we ordered; Cajun fries, garlic bread, oysters, and combo  a with the Cajun and garlic sauce. Cajun fries; 5/5; the fries were sooo good! It was not mushy, a bit crunchy and soft with the perfect seasoning ! Love the sauce!!! Garlic bread 5/5; it was superrrr delicious! The garlic wasn't overpowering and the seasoning was so good!! Oysters: 5/6; I HIGHLYYY RECOMMEND!! It was so worth $15 for 6 big ones!They give u the sauces on the side and they give us hot-sauce! The oysters were all fresh and Immaculate! Will totally get this again. Special A combo; 4/5; I really liked how the shrimp was fresh. However, the crawfish wasn't as fresh so I wouldn't get this again. The sauce was really good as well. Just wished that the crawfish was better. Service; Everyone was attentive and they were really nice and quick with our food. Overall, 4/5; I would totally come back here again to try their other items.Tip: they only accept cash."
1602,"I have been dying to eat here for the longest. It was extremely good. If you like spicy I recommend getting the hot or mild,  the spicy was TOO spicy. The staff was super friendly and accommodating to our needs."
1603,"Very delicious place for a seafood boil. Highly recommend the fried catfish and the shrimp (head on) with garlic sauce. Definitely on the more pricier side, but still worth it for a special occasion."
1604,"CASH ONLY! Service is great and I love how they have the seating spaced out during this pandemic. I was only brave enough to eat inside because my coworker assured me that the owner here was really on top of his cleaning and disinfecting of the place.The food is still fantastic. Love the garlic and butter.  The staff is super nice and tends to your needs very well. As a non-drinker, I had to ask for recommendations for the cocktails in which the staff was very patient about. The hurricane and the peach-lemonade was recommended to me and I had opted for the hurricane since thats what my friend wanted to try. Not bad at all. Its only not ""great"" because its the non-alcoholic side of me talking.I had tried their lobster roll once before, it is loaded and therefore worth its price but unfortunately their seasoning was not right for me so I won't be ordering it again but I definitely do not regret giving it a try!"
1605,"Crab legs, shrimp, sliders, crab cakes, etc. I can go on and on just delicious.  Take time to stop by or order for home.  You won't be disappointed."
1606,"Well eight years and a lot of crawfish later, I can safely say this is still my favorite boil place in the city, and one of my favorite restaurants of all time. This love runs deep!I came in a festive mood to celebrate Mardi Gras and my waitress Anita was incredible. The staff here have always treated me like an old regular, regardless of whether anyone actually remembers me, and Anita was no exception, she totally made my night! We were chatting and laughing like old friends, I needed that so badly, especially this year.The boil is still, obviously, the star of the show. The quality is consistent, I haven't found another spot that offers shrimp and crawfish so large AND so perfectly cooked every time. Nothing mealy, nothing overcooked, and when you put the work in to get that mudbug meat out you get a nice chunk because they're not serving you small pieces. I also think their sauce is bolder and more flavorful than anywhere else. Their raw oysters and shrimp cocktail are always fresh and tasty. And I love their drink menu. Abita Purple Haze, Allagash White, Ommegang, and Crabbie's Ginger Beer - it's like they keep all my go-to choices on tap just for me lol. Their cocktails are also excellent, their spicy margarita uses both spicy tequila and jalapeno sugar for an extra kick. The Saint Mojito makes me feel like I'm someplace warm and exotic with rum, lychee juice, and grenadine. They have an excellent outdoor dining setup for COVID. Plenty of space heaters keep the space toasty, with plastic strips covering the doorways to allow for airflow. They also put up plastic partitions between each table, which themselves are spaced out. Menu is a QR, except for the cocktail menu which is printed on each partition (so the drinks are always tempting you haha!). They even built wooden benches and floors - they really put in a lot of effort to make the space pretty and comfortable.Thanks for all the happy times Boil, sending y'all a bunch of love!"
1607,"I actually saw The Boil on my feed countless times. What I did not know was that it was called The Boil and it was super close to Grand Street in Chinatown. I was super excited to try seafood boil with Cajun seasoning.I was debating between the Queen Combo and King Combo so my boyfriend decided to order the King Combo ($67) and 1 lb of snow crab legs($25) with the cajun blend.  The King Combo is 1 lb of king crab and 1 lb of crawfish with garlic butter. Each cluster came with an ear of corn and some potatoes. To say the least, it was an abundant amount of seafood for two. The seafood was fresh and both sauces were real scrumptious. It did take us 3 hours to crack through all the crustacean shells though. The meat was briny and fairly sweet. The sauce was smoky, garlicky, peppery, and earthy. I would definitely come back for more seafood."
1608,"MUST COME HERE!!! This is one of my all time favorite restaurants in the city, and whenever I have visitors, I always bring them here if they're in the mood for seafood, spice, and don't mind getting a little messy. Food: My friend and I got one pound of headless shrimp to share, and we got it with the boil special with a medium spice level. The shrimp also comes with a piece of corn and a few potatoes. The sauce is sooooo yummy, nice and garlicky with a little bit of spice. I like spicy foods, so I could've handled more spice than the medium but I also didn't want it to be too spicy to the point where I couldn't really enjoy all the other seasonings. It tastes so good to peel the shrimp then dip it in the sauce. I've also tried the crab here before, and it was good, but the shrimp is my favorite since I feel like it soaks up the spices and flavor best. We also got Cajun fries which were the best fries I've ever had. There was so much seasoning on them, but it didn't seem overpowering, and it came with some garlic aioli on the side. We were both full after sharing the shrimp and fries, and it came out to $34 after tip and tax which isn't bad!Service: We were able to make a reservation online so we were immediately seated when we arrived, but I've also come here previously (pre-covid though), and we didn't have to wait long to get a seat without a reservation. The servers were quick to fill out waters for us, even though we had a pitcher on our table to fill our cups ourselves, but I think they realized with our messy hands we didn't want to touch the pitcher and cups. Service was quick getting our bill too which was nice.Messiness: So they provide bibs, gloves, hand wipes, and a ton of napkins which made it not too messy of a clean up after we finished eating. Ps. This place is cash only so either bring cash with you or they have an atm next door to get cash!"
1609,"My friend and I had dinner delivered on a Friday night from The Boil. The food came slightly past the allotted time but was still at a good temperature and delicious even when it did. For our dinner we decided to share 2 orders of 1 lb shrimp, a side of potatoes and a side of sausages. The sauce that came with all of the orders was absolutely delicious. All of the items were cooked very well. My only main complaint is that with the shrimp the only other items it came with was potatoes and one small cob of corn. I wish there was at least an extra one or two of the corn. Though the delivery came with small bibs to make sure you don't get the juicy sauce sprayed on your clothes, I really wish it came with some gloves and wet wipes because unfortunately my hands smelled like garlic and shrimp for a while after eating even after washing it multiple times All in all, a great dinner choice. Will definitely be ordering from them the next time I'm craving seafood just hope they give some gloves and wipes next time."
1610,Im not gonna lie I did not plan on eating here. I got really hungry and decided that the restaurant I wanted to go was far and this was in my face so I said let me try it . I love seafood but I don't like boils. All that messy cracking breaking and fighting for my food is a no for me so I have no desire to eats boils and most restaurants the menu is fairly similar with taste and additional items so I was prepared to be underwhelmed. Shockingly I really really enjoyed it I even found myself liking the medium garlic butter old bag sauce my niece had in her boil bag. Everything tasted seasoned and fresh. The garlic bread was actually a bun hilarious the big ass chicken tenders and catfish was fried perfectly. Now reason why I rated 3 stars I don't like is the fact it's cash only **side eye**plus auto grat of 20%. I work in the industry soo I get it but again adding that much to a bill automatically your paying at least $10. Not to mention standard gratuity at most is 18%. My bill was $103 with no liquor 1 entree two appetizers so I would say that's a rip off. The food was really good the pricing is fukin ridiculous though
1611,"What an amazing spot! We got the boil special for our sauce and it was one of the best that I have ever had! It was the perfect blend of garlic, butter, and Cajun seasoning. It comes with corn and potatoes. I recommend also getting sausages, fries, and steamed rice to soak up all the delicious goodness. Can't waste the precious sauce. I am still drooling!"
1612,"If you're a shellfish lover you can't go wrong eating here. It has a distinctly deep south feeling, aka huge drinks and even bigger portions of food. Such a fun place to go before a night out or to catch up with friends. There are a bunch of shellfish options at a reasonable price, plus a few heartier staples like potatoes and corn."
1613,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed the boil yet when I used to make it a tradition to go to the boil at least once a year. The best place for seafood in the city. They're cash only and everything is amazing here. I usually get a pound of shrimp, lobster, snowcrab, and clams. They give you a bib, tools to crack, and gloves. They also provide wipes too for after the cracking. The boil special sauce is the bomb!! So freaking good and each bag comes with a corn and potatoes. The corn here is seriously amazing. Sweet and crunchy and even better with the sauce. Their appetizer selection is also good. Favorites are the Cajun fries, soft shell crab, and crab cakes. They also have pretty good drinks here too! Cocktail drinks are $12 and they also have bogo for their happy hour. They have indoor and outdoor dining now."
1614,"Get ready to rock your world with this incredible seafood restaurant. If you love seafood and not just the bougee mussels you get at overpriced bars but actual seafood -- crawfish, shrimp, crabs, etc. -- then this is the place for you! Prepare to get your hands messy and use your napkin as a bib! I 100% recommend you get theBoil Special sauce because you'll end up dipping all your sides (potatoes, garlic bread, Cajun fries, etc) along with the seafood you get on it! You get to even adjust the level of spiciness -- personally I love ""spicy"" or ""fire"" anything that gets my nose runny! This is one of my favorite places to go when I'm craving fresh seafood and I've recommended it to multiple friends!!"
1615,"Visited this location yesterday with some friends and had no complaints. We came in and got seated right away and our waitress was attentive and always checking on us. For appetizers we had the fried calamari which was good and garlic bread that was eh. For drinks we all had the passion fruit margarita which was good but I tasted no alcohol ‍.For the food, I had the queens combo and substituted the crawfish for shrimp in the Boil special sauce which was so good and my friend had the same but in the garlic butter sauce and he said it was ok. My other friend had only clams in the boil special sauce and she said it was really good as well.  Also before the food came, we were giving gloves and disposable bibs. Overall I would recommend and will definitely come back. I had no complaints about anything and they are cash only."
1616,"The quality of the food and service has declined precipitously between our first and last visit and sadly this establishment has turned into yet another let down we'll be kicking to the curb. We booked a 4pm reservation which basically was when they first opened for the day, but for a $100 meal the food was incredibly underwhelming. The snow crab legs was not even fresh and tasted like it was left over from the previous day (it had a very unpleasant, almost mushy texture). The Cajun fries which we ordered for the appetizer was soggy and the service was lackluster. I feel very disappointed and I'm not sure if they are just having a bad day but they also changed to cash only and added 20% automatic gratuity to every bill which is a bold move on their part considering the subpar experience we had to endure. They really have no good excuse and I definitely have better use for my money given the myriad options available in the city."
1617,"Definitely not real Cajun food, but what can you expect from a southern Cajun restaurant in New York City. Seems like they put the seasonings on after and did not have anything to make true Cajun dip(which is very simple) It's honestly pretty offensive/stereotypical and very underwhelming, being that I am Cajun and was raised around true Cajun culture. Sorta culture appropriation but what can you do about it, it's just food right? Not like it's an art that people take seriously or anything, pretty sure if this was bad Italian everyone would know ..... oh well"
1618,"I've been coming to the boil for years and it was always be my go to for seafood boil. I've been to multiple different seafood boil places and nothing can compare taste wise. From taste to good service, this place has it all. I came with a group of 5 and had reservations for 6:30pm. We were still waiting on one more person but the hostess let us sit down first since it was so hot out and brought us water right away. We all ordered our seafood boils, the special sauce of course and fries. After eating half the fries we stopped our waitress for another order and mater on stopped her for an extra order of calamari. She was super sweet to us even though we kept asking for things every few minutes. When we got our boils, the shell bucket was quickly filled and every time someone would notice and switch it out for us right away. A lot of places with a gratuity charged automatically have subpar service, but here the waiters give it their all"
1619,"I don't know what people see in this place or maybe I'm ordering the wrong thing. The calamari last night was TERRIBLE. It tasted like it was fried in old oil and it was definitely fried too long. And then I couldn't even exchange it for something else. Waiter barely checked on us, the security was doing more work than him. Crab legs were ok but nothing to rave about. Stick to your gut, I said the first time I wouldn't return and I should not have but I bet i won't be back again for sure. The corn and potatoes were good and flavorful."
1620,"This gem is cash only, but so worth swinging by an ATM to indulge. The calamari was excellent with a nice hearty and spicy marinara to accompany it. We also enjoyed the crab leg in their signature sauce which included corn and potatoes as all good seafood boils do.  They have indoor and outdoor seating with the indoor seating adapted to minimize Covid exposure. The service was excellent. I would definitely go back if I lived closer."
1621,"As hubby and I fancy seafood boils, we stumbled upon this spot while out for Fathers Day weekend and let me tell you it was DELICIOUS!! It was packed and the security guy helped us snag a table outside! The drinks come in cute to go cups and they're all so flavorful yet strong. The food was piping hot and spot on with the flavors! Just be aware they only accept cash and have an ATM inside the restaurant. Needless to say we will be back!"
1622,"Very good,  very tasty Shrimp boilCrab cake and Cajun fries were all delicious. Well made cocktails. Heated outdoor dining. Great Service. Nice Friday after work outing"
1623,"Food was good, service was good too. Only down was they only take cash and they don't do peeled shrimp. But overall good. Wish they had sausage in their bags too, not just potato and corn."
1624,"The boil was really good! Delicious, spicy, messy, with corn and potatoes, the taste was spot on. It's a casual place so don't dress up, even with the bib n gloves u might get messy, the boil comes in a plastic bag that you open and the aromatic steam comes out and then you can use your hands, it's a delicious mess and truly a great seafood experience!!! Also nice contrast to so many overworked tiny seafood dishes around, here u can get ur fill on a budget! Order the combo and share for 2 or more"
1625,"First time trying the boil in jersey city. The flavors was really good. I only wish there was more meat in the king crab legs. In the bag, there was a good amount of potatoes  and 1 piece of corn . So be prepared to purchase sides. The prices make sense for jersey city. Update:I've eaten here twice within the same month, so not too shabby lol . The bill is usually under $100 (for inquiring minds)."
1626,"Ate here at 6:30 pm on Saturday, Feb. 13, 2021.  Here is my review.Parking - Street parking in a busy area.  Give yourself plenty of time if you made reservations.Cleanliness- the tables, seats and bathrooms were clean.  Staff wears mask, hand sanitizer is available at front door/tables, and they conduct thermometer checks for all guests before being seated.Social distancing observed - Yes.Reservations - we had dinner reservations at 6:30 pm and were seated fairly promptly.Food - we started off with the Cajun wings and calamari.  Both tasted average.  As for main entree, I ordered the snow crabs with the raging lemon pepper plus a side order of steamed rice, my wife ordered the shrimp (head on) with garlic butter plus a side order of sausages my daughter ordered the Mac-n-cheese and my mother-in-law ordered the Dungeness crab with garlic butter.  All the food was ok, but not stellar.Portion size - pretty abundant.Price - price of the food was fair.Service - the server was fast and friendly, but our food order took about 45 minutes.  Was a bit worried about time as they told us we could only stay for 1.5 hours when we first checked in and again as we were seated.  We did not rush to eat and still finished with 5 minutes to spare.Return visit - I would definitely return, but most likely not on a Saturday given street parking, which was made more difficult given heavy snow on the streets."
1627,Super tasty!!!I am so happy they opened a restaurant in jersey city. Their king crab is so fresh and sweet. Will visit this location often
1628,They discriminate people here . People got food who place the order after me . They didn't prepare my food more than 30 mins . And they didn't let wait people in the restaurant. I waited outside -3 more than 30 mins .
1629,Do not come here . I used to love coming here for some Cajun seafood but I'm not sure if I will go back anymore. I ordered Togo tonight and the food was not fresh . Some of the shrimp was mushy and the crawfish was not fresh . You can definitely tell the crawfish was dead or they used frozen. I hope I don't get sick tomorrow.
1630,"For me personally the service was terrible. The waitress was asked about the drinks served and what type of liquor was available... her response ""Idk, I do not drink alcohol."" I specifically asked for a warm (Connecticut Style) lobster roll. It was served ice cold. It appeared to me that it was in a  bucket, when you buy seafood or potato salad already made. It was tasteless. I did have a drink it was okay. Overall I was underwhelmed and unsatisfied to the max. This place is HIGHLY OVERRATED. I willNever go back nor recommend."
1631,The best boil I've had !! The sauce is perfect the seafood is perfect everything was perfect. The Mac and cheese was also very good and cheesy and served warm and fresh. I got a pound of crab legs and a pound of shrimp in the Boil blend sauce. The sauce was very very good. Also got the fried catfish with Cajun fries. 5/5 freshly friend and served with a nice Tatar sauce. Will defiantly come back and check out the other franchises
1632,"Was disappointed, came with a group to eat. We all ordered shrimp and crawfish. All orders had stale crawfish and we only ate the shrimp. Also, unlike all of the other seafood boil restaurants I've been to, the sauce is just added on after the seafood was made so the flavoring was just a coating with tons of garlic. So the seafood did not have any flavoring.Will not come back to the location, was expecting a lot more and traveled a bit to try this place out. Was way below average food. Giving 2 stars for the staff and service."
1633,Food was decent. But Overpriced and only took cash. Their in-restaurant atm did not work and we had to use a sketchy atm around the corner. The staff were rude and starting cleaning up the table while we ate. They charge a 20% service fee which  means you'll automatically pay $10 on every main dish you order. My meal cost $40 and I had to play $18 more for the service fee. Don't go unless you wanna pay extra and they can't slip checks. Not worth it for the cost.
1634,Food was great and my server Anita was very nice! I'll be back and I want Anita to take care of us again! Get the crawfish and get it spicy with 'the boil' style. Very juicy and full of flavor.
1635,Coming from San Francisco this is still my go to spot when it comes to Cajun Seafood. Aleta and the staff has been awesome and very attentive to us. We ordered the Lobster and Shrimp combo and Clams along with some killer Cajun Fries. Definitely will make more trips here in the later future when I'm in town!
1636,"Last night, I went to the boil with a friend. Of course it's popping on a Saturday night. The hosts Kwan was so nice. (i hope Im spelling her name right, she is a tall slimmer Asian woman.) She really set the tone for my experience. I can tell there were a lot of things happening but she remained calm and still gave her spill. I ordered queen crabs with shrimp Cajun blend and spicy, however it was far from spicy. My friend got mild and tried some of mine and said it tasted the exact same, which is my reasoning for one less star. The Brussels were AMAZING !!! My friend got shrimp with crawfish and she said her meal was pretty good. She also ordered a side of sausages which were okay, nothing special. The R&B tunes were playing, definitely going back but will do fire spice level."
1637,"Cool vibe, friendly staff. The food was good. However I wasn't a big fan of their Mac n cheese. Everything else was good that we ordered. Music was good. The drinks are delicious. I enjoyed my time here and will be back."
1638,"They have outdoor table which was nice we were there for quick dinner, wait was about 30-45Mins. Food came out quite slow. But they were busy! We got crab cake was delicious, shrimp with butter garlic sauce was awesome! is super nice and friendly. Always will be back!"
1639,"After trying countless other places, this is only other place I'll ever get a lobster roll from! It's a close contender to an even better roll"
1640,"The food was amazing ! The security and the buss guys were awesome to ! And so was our servant BUT he forgot to mention that he will add 20% to our bill of 4 ! 2 adults and 2 kids !Auto gratuity is when a restaurant automatically adds a gratuity charge to the bill of a party. Usually, this gratuity is equal to 18% ( he added 20 % ) of the bill and is only applied to parties of SIX or eight or more.There were 4 of us !Generally, a restaurant will print this policy on its menu to alert patrons before they receive their bill. NO ALERT NO NOTHING !I explained that to him that this is very rude and I would of course 1000% tip him and I feel like tactics like that are FU**£ super shady guys !!!!"
1641,"I've been wanting to go here for so long. It was so worth my wait. The out door seating has strong heating. We had jambalaya, garlic bread for sides. They were delicious. We split the crawfish and lobster with garlic butter. It was delicious. The servers were very friendly. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
1642,"The Boil has been on my radar for quite some time, but the opportunity never really presented itself to go. Well to day was the day. It was my friend's birthday and she wanted seafood so The Boil came up as an option. After she viewed the pictures we were decided.Arriving soon after opening for the day, (around 3:00pm) The staff was all there, masks and gloves on, ready to help with a smile. As a first time visitor, very welcoming. They gave us time and space to desire what it was we needed to purchase and so got order. When we were overwhelmed with all the delicious choices she suggested we select The Boil special flavor (all the other flavors together) for our combo. Good choice! We went with the Queen combo (snow crab and crawfish) and subbed out the crawfish for shrimp (heads off). We were both in dire need of those bering sea crustaceans, so we added snow crab as a main.  My friend also purchased some catfish and wings to take home for later. In retrospect, I should have too. The servings are appropriate for the price. It's more like a lunch size portion meal (includes fries), as opposed to an appetizer. Definitely enough for a meal.  I will definitely pick up something from that section next time. Personally I wanted to take part of the bogo to go happy hour, but as I was about to pay with my card, I was informed that they only took cash. There is a ATM on site, but we had to wait anyway so I walk to a bank nearby to avoid any fees. The food was ready in roughly 20 minutes and they were super nice by giving us utensils bibs gloves Exeter a so we could enjoy our food in a nearby park. Tempted by happy hour, I ended up purchasing the Saint mojito and 2 flavors of lemonade. All I can say super delicious and tasty (Im typing this review with a sufficient buzz from the Saint Mojito). The flavor of the sauce and the freshness of our food in those steam bags blew us both away! The crispy, savory, and slightly spicy fries were a great addition to the order, make sure to use the sauce. It would really rock on a po-boy.  They were so nice throughoutthe entire visit, even told my friend happy birthday a few times. We will definitely be back."
1643,First tf all I am very upset. I came near closing time and instead of this female telling me the grill is closed she gave me some soggy ass fries. When I went to ask for a refund she said it's because we came during closing time. That doesn't mean that you have to give me soggy fries tell me the grill is close. She wouldn't give me a refund or new fries. I'm so upset. Bad ass customer service just want to take peoples money
1644,"Unfortunately, it's the end of an era for me. After coming here for the past 11 years, we expected the same great food & good service....I was unpleasantly surprised. We got here early about 3:30-3:45pm and was greeted outside by disclaimer. Forgot the points made but did remember 20% gratuity is already added to the check. No problem!! We were the 2nd couple in the spot so we got to choose our seats. We usually have a female waiter but today they had a young guy. While the women are more personable, he was dry, no customer service experience at all. Maybe he was new..idk.Ordered: Food: 1lb of headless shrimp, dry. Mild Garlic butter and ole bay sauce on the side with white rice. He ordered 1lb of snow crabs legs, dry. Medium Garlic butter and ole bay sauce on the side with white rice. I had about 10-12 shrimp in the bag, no lie. Maybe it's because I got the sauce on the side. But the bag did not look attractive or tasted fresh. I would still have leftovers..nothing. He literally got 1 cluster of snow crabs...1! This is crazy! I can remember a time you would get 2 1/2 clusters of crab legs. He also ordered the crab sliders. Another disappointment! Drinks: the Hurricane & lime margarita for drinks. The lime margarita was basically a sip because it was loaded with ice. Hurricane was ok, seemed different- more like a slushy drink. I ordered a pineapple lemonade instead of the peach lemonade on the menu.  Now that was good! So the 1 star is for the bartender.So the bill was $121 for nothing. We don't mind paying money for great food. Clearly have been doing it for so long. However, the flagship restaurant is falling off. Yes we are in a pandemic but please don't shortchange us. Bring back the way you use to service the food. Train new employees better. Keep the bartender, he's keeping the place running. Unfortunately, we won't be back. Goodbye after 11 great years...."
1645,"Best seafood boil I have tried. Food was amazing. But, the best part was the service. Keen was so sweet and went out of his way to put our bibs on. Will be back!"
1646,"We got a pound of crawfish and a pound of king crab (aka King Combo) with their special Cajun Blend and spicy level. I must say that their ""spicy"" is not really spicy. If you are used to eating spicy asian food, you should probably go for ""Fire"". Overall, their king crab legs really tasted good and they were cooked just to right extent. Crawfish was a bit disappointing because it is just all made of shell and you wouldn't be able to eat much out of it. Next time I go here, I would go for King Crab + Dungeness Crab."
1647,I find any opportunity to go here. I recommend EVERYONE to go eat here. I've been there 5 times already and every time it's like im eating there for the 1st time. I LOVE THIS PLACE.
1648,"I order from this place a couple of times and love it. So far, it's my fav place for seafood boils. I am not a fan of their chicken wings so I'd just stick to the seafood."
1649,After getting the combos I order rice and mix it with the leftover sauce. It's so good!!!
1650,"The food there is quite okay. BUT! They do not accept credit card! ONLY CASH!!! Which is not quite convenient. Though they have  ATM machine at the front desk...When you made a reservation, you can't go to your table till everyone shows up which is reasonable. We went there at a Friday night, and it might be their rush hours, so they have lots of people waiting outside.They settled us in a small table, and the place is a bit crowded. The service is good though, people are nice, it's just the room is  so crowded for a group of three. The food there is actually tasting good! But I would not recommend crab leg. The sauce tastes good. The flavor is just perfect for us, the boil sauce with medium spicy level. They serve alcohol as well, It's okay.Hope they can accept credit card next time!"
1651,"YUM!We came in around 5pm on a rainy Saturday, luckily we were seated quite fast. We were offered the bar area, or shared table as well as a table for 2 on the side. My boyfriend chose the table of 2. I remember when this location was first opened, they already have a tremendous wait/line to get in. After all these years nothing have change especially their food and service.Everything was wonderful! We love seafood and we came for Ericks birthday, we went a little too crazy with the food. We had ordered for the 2 of us -$45 Combo B: lobster and shrimp or substitute crawfish  -$35 Dungness Crab  -$15 Clams -$12 Southern fried wings  -$4 Garlic bread For the sauces we decided on ""the boil"" mixture of garlic butter & Cajun sauce which was delicious, but we should've tried the other one because we had too much garlic that night.Overall everything was very fresh! It obviously took a longer to come because at 5pm they were already a full house. Our wings n breads came first and we were so hungry, but the wings were piping hot. The service can not forget is the best best, they will ask if everything is doing good, refill your water cups, trash out your tray for of shells, see if you need anything else. At the end of the meal they'll also offer you wet wipes and kindly open the package for you. 5 ***** for the service!Once again I love love seafood and this place is the only place I love the most. If you ever come to New York or Downtown, go to this spot. not the other names, trust me !Cash only"
1652,"My roomies and I had an absolute blast at this establishment.The food was very good, and for the price you get quite a lot of quality food. I really appreciated the service as well.Our waiter took the time to teach us how to properly eat some of the food and was a great sport with the likes of three of us. Seasoning and sauce is absolutely on point and I loved some of the server's recommendations. I left very full and happy. Can't wait to come back. 4.8/5"
1653,"I've been coming to the Boil for years.Today I ordered 2 separate orders of crab legs only to find one single order in the bag with no corn or potatoes. I went back in and asked for the rest of my meal and was told that both orders were in one box. I come home to find only one order of crab legs in ONE BAG. This is ridiculous and no one answers the phone when you call back. Mine and my daughters meals were both ruined. If you can't commit to a certain level of customer service and diligence then you shouldn't stay open. I want a credit for my meal. I can't speak to any managers as the Waverly location and the LES location are not answering phones. You guys really should get it together as this is very disappointing.No, the server said they were in the same BOX not the same bag. We were not traveling to the same place so how were the two orders to be separated? I asked her if they were separate in the same box and she said yes. Please get all info from the server and security before replying on yelp. I will call and speak with a manager today if they ever answer the phone. I did see the ""owner"" quickly drop in with his car parked outside and he had the the staff nervous running around crazy as usual, but either way service should not suffer."
1654,"Went to the boil after craving it and since it had been a while since I've visited I figured why not give it a shot. Sad to say. I don't think I'll ever be visiting the boil again. Though the food was tasty in flavor, the shrimp didn't taste fresh to my liking, the sausage was a bit salty, the worst part of it all is the rise in their prices. Their prices have increased, there is now a 20% hospitality fee, tax and with gratuity added to the bill. A simple $50 seafood meal turned into paying $104 per person. Our bill rendered to be $175 which after my assumption was gratuity, jumped to a total of $204. Keep this in mind when thinking of visiting the boil."
1655,"Came here for the first time with a friend who really likes The Boil and I definitely enjoyed it. i got shrimp and snow crab legs along with some rice noodles to sop up the sauce. We got it with their signature sauce which was very rich and garlicky. The sauce is really what makes it addictive, but I do have to say that their sauce is quite heavy. I felt it the next day for sure and the garlic definitely lingers around for a while even after brushing my teeth. Service was good. They also provide you with gloves and bibs to make sure you aren't getting sauce or food everywhere. They also clear the plate of shells pretty often so you don't constantly have a pile in front of you. I do have to say that it gets quite packed here, so it's best to make a reservation, but we were lucky since we were a group of 2 so we got a table pretty quick."
1656,"What a great food Experience!!! I have been meaning to come to the boil for some time now but something always pops up and I never make it. Finally the opportunity arose and i got to try it last night. Can we say AMAZING!! I can't wait to go back.Food: I went with a group of friends and we chose to share and try different things. For apps we shared a shrimp cocktail which was too cold in my opinon. Slighty frozen still. Cajun Wings which were tasty but came out extremely hot. My friend had the Gumbo. The others seemed to enjoy that. Now unto the main entrees. We shared 4 pounds of snow crabs amongst 5 of us and I think that worked well. The flavors were flavorful. We had the cajun spicy and the garlic butter. Both were so good. We had a few sides as well, cajun fries, garlic bread, and sausages. All great! The spicy was good not too hot in my opinion. Drinks: they were great however not really strong. I had the mojito and hurricane to try and they were tasty. Service/Ambiance- place is popular wish it was bigger. Just felt there wasn't enough space if you have a larger party. They were nice to move us from a slighty smaller table to a bigger one. That was much needed as we had a party of 8. Also the waiter was snippy. Felt he had an attitude at times. Tip: CASH Only which is annoying . Their Atm broke while my friend already had processed her withdrawal. They werent helpful in that situation.  I'd suggest getting cash elsewhere. Get there early!"
1657,"Haven't been on the boil for a while. I always enjoyed their food despite so many Cajun seafood places are popping up in the recent years. However I have to say that their recipes kind of change and also the seafood is not as fresh as before, especially the shrimps we had. The most common seafood that you shouldn't messed up and they did. Also, we ordered a cider in a bottle because of covid reason we didn't feel comfortable drinking anything from a glass. The waitress refused to change it for us while the menu clearly stated as bottle. We were very disappointed regarding that part as they didn't offer us any other options. We paid for a drink that we didn't touch. It was an awful experience too. I understand that we are in difficult time now and I don't want to give a negative review but I believe service and food have to always be constant in the hospitality business."
1658,"They have one of BEST seafood sauce ever!!!! I'm not even kidding because I've been to boiling crab and crab shack in Cali and this one by far tops them. It's buttery and not too in-your-face type of spicy. All of us got our respective combo. Mine and my brother shared a Queen combo, substituting crawfish with shrimp, with the Boil Special as the sauce. I wish you could see our plastic bag because it was definitely just an empty plastic bag at the end. We scraped every Snow crab and shrimp and also the sauce with it-- my brother even had 3 cups of rice to pair it with. It was such a harmonious buttery Cajun blend of seafood feast. I guess it's not bad for its price because you're getting a lot out of it. Only con is that they only accept cash-- pretty much going to be broke every time I come here but I must say, it is all worth it."
1659,"This is the first time I've actually been to a seafood boil so I don't have anything to compare it to. However, the food and service here was nothing short of amazing. I decided to start my meal here with the gumbo which was exceptional. Proper level of spice and packed with flavor from the meats and shrimp. I was definitely not aware of how much 2 lbs of seafood was until it hit the table. We had one pound of crab and one pound of shrimp with a side of rice and garlic bread to sponge up the excess sauce. The seafood was definitely very fresh and you can tell when you're peeling the shrimp and cracking open the crab legs. She shrimp shell comes off with ease and isn't stuck to the meat. The crab shell slides right off leaving you with a huge chunk of crab meat which went perfectly with their boil signature sauce. We opted for spicy but honestly I could've went for the fire level spicy. I felt the spicy was only a notch above mild. Servers here were very attentive and well mannered. This is a definite return for me!"
1660,Small hole in the wall pizzeria in the West Village.  The best thin slice pizza i ever had.  Sauce is perfect and right amount of cheese.  They only serve cheese slice or pepperoni slice and can buy pies and drinks. Cash Only there was a ATM machine on premise.  Ordered a pie and it doesn't fit in the box.  Nice large slices.  Check it out you won't be disappointed.  And line always out the door....
1661,"This should be a five star average place. Is the atmosphere great? No. But the pizza is absolutely fantastic. Service is quick and friendly. I can see why this is ""famous Joe's"". Definitely worth the trip."
1662,"Best pizza in NY - lots of locations scattered around NY and also good price point for the crazy delicious pizza!I tried the cheese, pepperoni and white pizzas. Cheese and pepperoni were classics - perfect thickness, crispy and chewy with the perfect amount of cheese and sauce. White pizza was great too if you want to try something different. Definitely recommend all three pizzas"
1663,"Alright with your plum tomato, olive oil drizzle, Buffalo mozzarella! Joe's Pizza is the raw, classic, typical New York slice that most people describe when they say that there's no other pizza like New York pizza. It's the perfect slice to fold in one hand and eat on the go. I've heard that Joe's is a legendary pizzeria and that their pies are a must-try-at-least-once-in-your-life. So in case I die tomorrow, I can say I've tried it!I ordered the plain cheese pie for delivery and reheated it when I got home. I opened the box as soon as I got it and it looked very promising. It looked even better after 7 minutes in the oven. Then I finally got to try it and....it reminded me of many of the family-owned pizzerias in the boroughs. It tasted homemade and specially cooked up just for me. It was flavorful and not too doughy. It was definitely good, but it didn't blow me away. However, I'm sincerely glad that I got to try it and that it got to be a part of my cheat meals. TLDR: Joe's is a solid 4. Good quality stuff, but probably not the best you've ever had."
1664,"Yum!We didn't personally visit the restaurant. B ordered their Cheese and Pepperoni pizzas on goldbelly.com. So grateful! The order came in a timely manner and was packaged neatly (with dry ice). Heating instructions are included. The pizzas are individually wrapped. They have a classic New York-style ultra-thin crust that folds perfectly in one hand. Joe's cheese pizza is naked, and incredibly delicious. Joe's pepperoni pizza is topped with spicy pepperoni, perfect for meat lovers. The consistency and flavors are all there. So glad we got a chance to try out Joe's Pizza. Thank you B :D"
1665,"It breaks my heart to do this, but I have to give Joe's a 3 star. The pizza was very mediocre and for some reason reminded me of the pizza I had at Chuck E Cheese when I was a kid. A very reliable spot after you knock down a few drinks and want a revival meal, but all in all, I don't think you can deem it a New York must try."
1666,"Came here with my grandfather after obviously hearing a lot about this place. I ordered 1 Sicilian, 1 regular and 1 mozzarella slice. I'm not really into pizza but I thought this was pretty good; the mozzarella slice was the best and I also really liked the Sicilian. The prices were great too. Thanks!"
1667,"Joe's is a simple nyc pizza that hits the spot, quick, goes down easy and satisfying. I almost wanted to get a second slice, but had to resist. If you are nyc you need to hit up Joe's!"
1668,The perfect NY slice. Just remember that it's a cash only place so have some $$ ready or use the ATM outside. A little pricy for a slice but a must do any time you are in NY.
1669,Definitely a must pizza place to try in the city. Solid 4.2. John's on Bleeker is still my favorite but this come close in my top 5! No line either when we arrived!
1670,Wow what a big disappointment!!! This pizza was a joke. It's just like any other pizza you get from a dollar slice.  I'm not sure why anyone would go here besides the fact that johns of Bleeker street doesn't sell slices.
1671,"This is the best late-night pizza I have had. You have to pay in cash. There is no seating. But, they are quick and the slices are delicious. If you want a good, classic, NYC slice - Joe's is your place.(From @tastessky on Instagram)"
1672,Joe's pizza does not live up to the hype but they serve good pizza. I would come here if I was just passing by and craving a plain slice to-go. It has a very thin airy crust with the perfect amount of cheese but I wish there was slightly more tomato sauce. It may not have been hot enough so I did not get the classic cheese pull after I took a bite. They cut the pies unevenly so you may either get a very large slice or a normal sized one. Joe's is your solid neighborhood pizza joint but not impressive.
1673,"Waited about 15 mins in line, and ate our great slice in the park across the street. Cash only"
1674,Slice was good and reminded of that old school NYC vibe. It's hard to come by pizzeria's that carry classic slices. The only thing I was not too fond of was that the slice was too thin near the front. I could not fold it without it bending.
1675,"Seriously... can't go wrong.Especially with very late night pizza. Line was fairly long, but it moved fast. They didn't have our slices ready when we ordered, but they came out quickly.There was a lot of people eating pizza outside, like a lot! A LOT!Great slices. Always pretty fresh, because they're so busy. Always try and get a late night slice from Joe's when I'm in NY. Would recommend!"
1676,"nothing says NYC summer like a hot slice from Joe's + Coca Cola in a cold glass bottle. if you haven't had the pizza at Joe's, then you are not living your best life. a plain slice will run you like $3ish bucks and coke in a glass bottle  is about the same. whether it be a plain cheese slice, a whole pie, a square slice, or 'zza with a variety of toppings--the pizza here is legit. the cheese, sauce, and crust are nearly perfection on the plain slice--turning melty cheese, flavorful tomatoes, and a thin crispy crust into that iconic New York slice. The quality is consistently excellent as Joe's has been feeding NYC delicious slices for decades. service is fast. it's a small spot hardly any seating inside. there are some tables outside. and there's tiny park across the street. get your pizza, fold it like a New Yorker and start eating as it would be sinful to let this 'zza get cold. drops mic cuz pizza is lifei outzzz"
1677,Joe's Pizza is absolutely delicious I think that it may be my 2nd favorite pizza in all of New York City.I recently moved to California from New York and was back for 48 hours and knew that I must go to Joe's. FYI Ray Romano goes to Joe's at the end of his Netflix special!
1678,"The classic NY slice -- thin, hot and fast. Got just the plain cheese pizza and it was the perfect size for 3 of us, I think it made 6 slices. The service is brash, zero time for pleasantries but because of that, the line moves quickly. Seems like they're running a really tight operation. Overall, would highly recommend and will be back when I'm in NYC again."
1679,Poppin. Our room was still being cleaned. I told the lady I'm starving! We walked over to Joe's first meal off the plane and we were not disappointed. So delicious. We got a regular pepperoni and combo. I got myself craving pizza after writing this review lol.
1680,"We were very excited about the rare domestic finding of Sukhothai Noodle soup and this didn't disappoint at all.Place is definitely on a much higher plane than even the good Thai restaurants around.So strange to find such regional authenticity on 9th Ave. of all places, but we'll take it!"
1681,"Great local Thai food place with unique dishes at a decent price! We had great service, and it felt very authentic since many of the workers were Thai and the place felt very homey inside.My boyfriend and I stopped by for a quick bite so we shared the Thai iced tea and the Nakorn-Patom Duck Noodle Soup. Would highly recommend the noodle soup because it was a dish I haven't seen at other restaurants I've been to, and was very refreshing. It has the pho rice noodles and a subtly sweet broth that didn't feel too heavy. I definitely would come back again to try the other things on the menu!"
1682,Food: 4/5Stopped by for a quick dinner with my bf. He ordered the ratchaburi and I ordered the chili chicken. The texture of his egg noodles were perfect and it surprisingly had a lot of flavor for a dry dish. My chili chicken came loaded with veggies! The dish had a lot of sauce albeit light and tasty. Service: 4/5Very friendly yet no nonsense staff! Limited seating although they expanded their venue. No complaints overall but not a place to leisurely wine and dine.Ambiance: 3/5Very fast casual. No frills with sweatpants acceptable. Come for the food. You don't be disappointed.
1683,Took myself out after a day of work to eat alone and it was probably the best solo restaurant experience. The food was incredibly delicious and I cant stop raving about the pork and crab dry noodles. I must go back to try everything on their menu! No other thai restaurant compares now...
1684,"I had always planned on coming here one day as a pre-theatre meal thanks to its proximity to Broadway, but had never been because they did not take reservations. Not sure when that changed, but recently saw that they did and knew I had to try at next opportunity. We were promptly seated once our entire party arrived. Service is super fast and you sort of get the feeling they want to turn over the tables quickly, so don't plan on staying over an hour. We ordered the pork soup, pork and crab noodles, and wok stir fried calamari curry. Everything was very good, but didn't exactly blow us away. At the price point though, you get good value and is a very good option for dinner when in the area."
1685,"I came here with a friend before a Broadway show and was seated right away. The restaurant looks small when you first step in but there is an area at the back with extra tables and bathroom.I ordered the pork noodles which taste wonderful. The broth is very flavorful and strong, and the pork is well-seasoned. The pork crackling is a nice touch and I could not stop eating. I also had the Thai tea which tastes rich and creamy. The table next to us ordered a couple of dishes and the seafood noodles looked super appetizing. I would like to order it next time. Service was great and fast. They do ask for proof of vaccination with ID."
1686,"Definitely one of my go-to Thai restaurants in Hell's Kitchen and NYC in general! They offer indoor (pretty spacious) and outdoor seating. I definitely prefer going on a weekday during lunch time, it's generally crowded on weekends and probably comes with longer wait time.I ordered the Sukhothai Pork noodle soup (after previously having tried pad kee mao and the crab pork noodle) and I think it's my favorite because I gravitate towards more tart/sour notes. It's definitely an acquired taste so be warned if you don't like sourness (my friend suggested it to me but she didn't like it herself). I found the blend of sour and spicy very pleasant. I also liked how there was a decent portion of vegetables to accompany the pork which wasn't gross/fatty. I don't normally finish the broth or order noodle soups because it leaves me bloated but I just really liked the broth. If you want to steer clear and try other noodle soups, the normal pork one is always a safe option.We shared a papaya salad on the side - very fresh, adjusted for medium spicy which actually builds in intensity too. The crunch of the green beans, papaya and peanuts added texture to the dish for sure - this one is also spicy sour in its own way.I'd highly recommend to check this place out - probably won't be disappointed."
1687,"Came at ~630 on a weeknight and was immediately seated. The restaurant looks really small from the front, but there's a nice area in the back that loops around to provide lots more seating. Seats were pretty close together and there was a man nearby who was coughing which was alarming.Got the vegetable dumplings to share and I got the tofu pad thai (tofu was more expensive than chicken for some reason fyi). Vegetable dumplings were good, but the skin was a bit odd. The little slice of pepper on top added a nice flavorful kick to the dish.Tofu pad thai was quite large and a solid dish. The noodles didn't taste very fresh or stretchy, but it was a pretty good dish and one of the better Thai spots in this neighborhood. Service was great throughout with our water never falling below 1/2 full. Great Thai spot in HK and would definitely come back if I'm in the area!"
1688,"Great Thai place in Hell's Kitchen - what a find! NYC has a lot of delicious Thai options and we were happy that Pure Thai was just as yum as those. The wait was about 20 mins on a Fri night so not too bad. The restaurant is actually bigger than it looks. While we were glad our usual Thai options (Pad Kee Mao, Pad Thai, etc.) were all on the menu, we were impressed that some other authentic Thai dishes were on the menu. Between the two of us, we split the Pad Kee Mao (spicy) and Crab & Pork Noodles. The Pad Kee Mao was the perfect level of spice and a good size portion too. It was our first time trying the Crab & Pork Noodles and we loved the savory, sweet, tangy flavors. Service was good as well!"
1689,"I've been here twice for dinner and I definitely will come back again when I'm craving Thai food. Pad Thai is one of my favorite foods and this place definitely has one of the best pad thais I've ever tasted. It's nice and saucy with intense flavors. Now, I'm craving it again just from thinking about it!When we went, it was pretty busy and they were short staffed so the wait for our food was long. We didn't mind though and they even ended up giving us free thai iced teas for waiting. It's a small restaurant so I wouldn't recommend going with a big group."
1690,"I would honestly say this remains my favourite Thai in NYC.Went back this week after a long Covid break. The menu has changed slightly (they took off my favourite jungle rice dish..). They have also expanded into the space next door which has cut down on wait time.We had drinks, mixed appetizers (small not very exciting portion), green curry and the duck noodle soup. The duck noodle soup was excellent just as I remembered, a big bowl, full of freshly made toppings and noodles.Be careful if you order anything with 3 stars for heat- it's one of those places which really mean it !"
1691,"Food 5/5My Thai friend said this place has the most authentic Thai food in the city, and I was not disappointed. Great intense flavors, and the pad thai had a very balanced amount of peanuts for the crunch and lime for the citrus flavors. Noodles were also the perfect chew. Not much to say except definitely a staple if you're ever craving Thai food! Interior 5/5The restaurant is a long thin corridor, so it was a little tight, but the decor was very interesting combination of rustic and industrial. Service 5/5The waiter was very friendly and gave great recommendations."
1692,A very authentic Thai place in midtown west/hells kitchen. Make sure to put in your chicken wings order as they take some time to make. The noodles were all amazing and so were the appetizers. I will definitely be back! The pork was perfectly sweet!
1693,"I had a wonderful lunch experience at Pure Thai Cookhouse. When entering the restaurant, we were greeted with a ton of smiles from the hostess and servers. For my dining pleasure, I went with the Sukhothai Pork Noodle soup. If I ever visit Pure Thai Cookhouse, this will be my go-to dish ... well, go-to bowl. The soup has a nice blend of rice noodles, roasted pork, long bean, bean sprout, small tofu, peanut, and dried shrimp in pork broth. The prices on the menu are pretty much in line with other places in the neighborhood. Looking forward to visiting again."
1694,Super tasty! I really liked the wok chicken and chicken satay buns. The pad see ew with beef was also good and the thai ice tea was not too sweet. Interior of the restaurant is quite small and tables are very close together. Can be a bit loud since everyone is seated so close so not prime date spot but really decent food!
1695,"This is hands down my favorite Thai food in New York City. Living in Hell's Kitchen, there are many options to choose from when it comes to Thai cuisine, but I choose Pure Thai every time. The restaurant is cozy and the aesthetic is exactly what you want from a Thai place. The restaurant staff is very kind and helpful. Not to mention the food is absolutely delicious. I would recommend the pad Thai with shrimp. You can go wrong!"
1696,"Pure Thai is the best Thai restaurant in nyc. I know...it's a bold statement. It may not be the prettiest or the best on customer service but when it comes to the food, just wow. I probably been to about 20 Thai restaurants in Manhattan and over 100 across the globe and this place must be my top 5. I had quite high expectations coming  in and when your expectations are high, it tend to lead to disappointment, but it wasn't the case here. When I took my first bite of the papaya salad, my first thought was...yes, yes, this is how it's meant to taste. This is the perfect balance of flavors. And then heading to the noodle soup, on first sip. I just pictured myself on a small little sail boat eating these noodles back in Thailand. It was just perfect. I had to force myself to eat slowly so that I can savor the experience. I can probably go on and on, but let me conclude with this:If you're Thai, you'll love it here. If you're not Thai, you'll love it here. Everyone will love it here. This spot is freaking amazing and I'll be back to try other dishes."
1697,"We came here on a Tuesday night and it was very busy.  The restaurant is split between two separate store fronts, plus a sidewalk/bus lane outdoor dining area.  By 6pm there was already a 45+ minute wait for tables so definitely call to make a reservation if possible.  Pairs of 2 were also seated side by side at the bar instead of across the table.The Thai iced tea was served in a large beer stein with shaved ice - not typical, but really tasty!  The size was a decent serving for $5.  But for the small-to-avearge portion size of the entrees, the costs here are really high.  The beef and broccoli noodle was $17 and was fairly paltry on the beef and veggies.  It was majority egg noddles.  The fried rice was $20 which is quite expensive.  The mild spice level still had a pretty decent kick to it."
1698,"Came here for dinner the other day. I've been here before, but this time was surprised to see that they had cocktails / alcohol on the menu. It was $9 for a hot toddy, which was served in a champagne flute, which is a bit overpriced in my opinion, but it was also delicious. I feel like overpriced is the name of the game here. All the food was extremely delicious, but everything seemed a bit more pricey than you would normally pay for the same thing in the area (say at viv thai or obao). That being said, I would say that it is a notch above these other places. I ended up getting the pad kee mao, which I had never seen before. They let me adjust the spice to not spicy, and it was actually not spicy (some places say that it won't be spicy and then there is still some residual spice). It ended up being great and exactly what I wanted. They also have more seating now, as I think they took over the place next door, so you have a better chance of getting a seat and sitting down. The service was good, but nothing to write home about. Overall a pretty good Thai option for the area."
1699,"One of my favorite thai spots in the city. Albeit small, this spot does their food well. I've been here twice and ordered different things each time but it has never failed me yet!"
1700,"Best of the best Tom yum noodle in townI love the food, service and nice place Went there on the cold day in nyc to crave some noodle soup. Never go wrong with this place The food was superb !!!! I wish I live in the city! So I can go there everyday."
1701,"Pure Thai is one of my most favorite restaurants in New York City if not the most favorite! I order take out from here at least couple of times a week. I know they are getting more popular nowadays and they have expanded by getting the next door spade which is helpful. My old time to go dish was basil chicken with jasmine rice (note that healthier option mixed rice changes the taste of this dish so I stick to jasmine rice. My now all time fave is Ratchaburi Crab dry noodles with pork - it's so flavorful yet looks simple. Finally, I love pad see ew and you can never go wrong with that. People love pad Thai here too. The staff is very friendly too. I did see celebrities here to my surprise. The ambiance is very cool with Thai pop in the background and in the interior. Love love love this place"
1702,"One of the best Thai in the area. I got the pad see ew, which was one of the best I've ever had. My boyfriend got the green curry and as a huge fan of spicy food, he was very happy with the taste and spice level. The Thai tea and mango coconut sticky rice was also amazing. The only eh thing was the crispy tofu- the texture was great and my boyfriend enjoyed it but I thought it could have used more flavor."
1703,"A personal favorite. Exquisite food. As a Thai curry lover it took me a bit to get used to their stir-fry/dry ""curries"", instead of the regular form, but really great all around. It's a bit of a hole-in-the-wall which reminds me of Thailand, but may or may not be your thing"
1704,"9th Ave has plenty of Thai restaurants, and while I believe there is no such thing as bad Thai food, Pure Thai still is above the competition. The pad thai and pad see ew are incredible - noodles are delicious, spice adds so much flavor, and portions are generous. However, what really blew me away was the root vegetable puffs and lemongrass tea as these were so unique and flavorful. The restaurant atmosphere is also quite peaceful and the music is great, seriously cant recommend enough!"
1705,"Back at Pure Thai Cookhouse.Been craving their noodles soooooo much !!!! Had to visit to get the unique Thai taste ~Ordered [lunch menu 6/11/2021]1) Sukhothai pork noodle soup ($15)2) Ratchaburi crab & pork dry noodle ($16)As usual, both outstanding, and never disappointing.Some might find Sukhothai soup a bit ""funky"" since it gives a combination the sweet, sour, and fish sauce flavor. The Ratchaburi dry noodle is more subtle, so it you want a stronger flavor, add some spicy sauce and voila ~~Both had plenty pork slices and worth every dime spent !!!!The only thing I would change (for me) is make the Sukhorhai soup ""warmer"" or hot. It is always just lukewarm."
1706,"We popped by because we were in the neighbourhood and what a great find! I recommend Thai tea and papaya salad, which were very refreshing for the hot summer we've been having!We then ordered the Sukhothai pork noodle soup, the Ratchaburi crab and pork dry noodle, which were very flavourful. There was a generous portion of crab and pork in the dry noodle. The Sukhothai noodle tasted sour, salty, swet and spicy at the same time! The food was generally light and not too oily, which I always appreciate. Service was fast and friendly."
1707,"Very authentic and delicious Thai food! We had the green curry, pad see ew, and pad Thai (recommend all)"
1708,"Try to avoid going here on the weekends as it is super super busy; I always try to come at a random time like 3 pm on a Tuesday. Dinners on weekdays aren't too bad, but this place is definitely always poppin', for a good reason! I've been going to Pure Thai regularly for two years now, and it is still hands down the best thai spot in Hell's Kitchen imo. The curry, pad see ew, and pork+crab noodles are some of my favs, but you can never go wrong with anything from Pure Thai's menu. So so so yummy!"
1709,"One of the better options in a challenging dining neighborhood (albeit with some good finds along 9th avenue), Pure Thai is a stalwart and standout in a sea of Hell's Kitchen Thai places.This was my first visit here since before the lockdown and they have a smooth operation going. A quick flash of the vax card or Excelsior pass gets you a seat in the narrow dining room adjoining the busy open kitchen.I went with the Ratchaburi Crab & Pork Dry Noodles, on of their most popular dishes. The egg noodles were moist but still chewy and delicious, and the real (not imitation) crab plated next to slices of delicious, sweet pork worked well and went down with a proper bottle of Chang. Next time I'd probbaly try something with a bit more kick, such as the seafood noodle bowl.The prices post-COVID are harder to swallow than the authentic offerings on hand but supporting local restaurants always tastes good."
1710,The food is very unique here although I only tried two of their dishes. The have a distinct taste which I wasn't sure if I liked at first but as you keep eating it got better.
1711,"Cute cozy Thai restaurant. As others have mentioned, there's no shortage of Thai and I'm still on the lookout for the best one in the area. We stopped by early on a Friday evening and to our surprised probably got the last 2 available seats. The place is very narrow with a kitchen up front and pretty limited seating. By the time we left, there was a line out the door. Service was fast and friendly, interesting menu. They do have alcohol and even a few warm cocktails. I tried the pad see ew with tofu and vegetables and it was just average, bit on the salty side and sort of sitting in a large pile of sauce. The noodles were cooked well but would've preferred a different taste profile. Hubby got the krabi seafood soup and was warned multiple times by the server that it has a fermented tofu flavor. I wasn't a fan but he enjoyed it. Portions are on the larger side. definitely was expecting to be blown away by the staple noodle dishes but they just average."
1712,"Most authentic Thai food I've had in Hell's Kitchen so far! Really good quality ingredients! Ordered lunch on a Tuesday through their website, and the food came in the anticipated timeframe. Portions were enough for my SO and I to make two meals of it. For $16 each that's a great deal. Pad Se Ew with Beef: the beef is good quality and the vegetables were perfectly crisp still. The sauce was light but flavorful. Red curry with chicken: there was plenty of moist chicken and lots of veggies (I super love bamboo shoots and these were in abundant supply.) This dish cannot be made mild and it was satisfyingly spicy! I'll definitely be back to try the other dishes!"
1713,"Had a meal with some coworkers here back in November.  We sat outside, which was a nice space and the service was really great and fast.  I had the drunken noodles and found them to be the perfect amount of heat (which is quite spicy) but still had great flavor.  For apps we shared the curry puffs which was great with the vinegar sauce and really enhanced the taste profile. We also had the dumplings which were beautiful and had a lovely delicate flavor.  One of my work colleagues did brave the seafood noodles soup which the waiter did give warning on that some people are put off by the smell, but she really loved it and said that it was great. Seems that it is for true seafood lovers!"
1714,"I had very high expectations for this place because of the amazing reviews but it was underwhelming. I got the Pad See Ew and Wok Vegetable Medley With Tofu. We also got the sangria which was tasty but not much alcohol at all. Both of the dishes I got were kind of bland, especially the tofu in the pad se ew because it wasn't marinated at ALL. It seemed like they just threw some tofu on top of noodles and nothing else. The tofu in garlic sauce was also bland but the garlic sauce it came with was very tasty so we just cut the tofu peaces smaller and dipped in there. I'm don't think i'd go back here."
1715,"The BEST pad Thai chicken I have ever had and I eat a lot of Thai food! All the dishes we ordered were so mouthwatering and I loved them all. Pad Thai chicken--11/10Pad see ew--10/10Papaya salad-- 8/10 (wish it was a bit more spicy)Egg rolls--7/10Even though the restaurant was very busy, all the employees were super attentive and we received our food on a pretty timely manner. Can't wait to come back to NY to eat here again!"
1716,"Amazing Thai food!!! Highly recommend!!!Very cozy ambiance with open kitchen where you can see all the food magic happen in front of you! There's one table in the front, some bar seats and couple more tables in the back. There's also outdoor seating if you prefer.The food was so good! Everything tasted great!Got the mixed appetizers cuz we wanted to try everything - the Thai Curry Dumpling was my personal favorite - it's got shrimp, crab and the right amount of kick to it!I knew I had to get the Krabi Seafood Noodle Soup when I saw the warning sign ""not recommended for novices"" - definitely ain't a novice! Wow! Loved it! The broth definitely has a strong fermented tofu smell and flavor to it which worked very well with the underlying tomato pork base. The flat noodles sucked up all the flavors from the broth and had great texture.The ratchaburi crab & pork dry noodles was good too. The egg noodles had a good chew to it. Although personally I would prefer a stronger flavor for this dish since there is no broth.Overall great experience and great service!"
1717,"Really delicious food and extremely friendly staff. The food is priced reasonably and the servings are generous. They do not take reservations so you'll need to go in person to add your name to the end of the list. They will call you when it's your turn which is really nice. We went there on a Friday night at like 6pm and the wait was about 30 minutes which was not bad. Inside the seating is a little tight in certain areas. There is a little narrow passage way with bar seating. I like that there are coat hangers on the walls! Really helpful for the winter time. The lighting is on the dimmer side and made the restaurant very cozy. I had the duck noodle soup with thin rice noodles. The sauce that accompanies it is delicious but a little too spicy for me  I also had a season apple cider red wine which came in a cute mug and saucer. It had spices like a full stick of cinnamon, star anise, and cloves. It was a really tasty drink. They also played some Thai pop which slapped and made for a nice environment. I recommend checking this place out."
1718,"tl;dwr: solid food and service, great if you like your foods sweet.Thai noodle soups are hard to find but this place makes them. I ordered the Sukhothai noodle soup which is supposed to be a pork broth base. I found it difficult to taste the flavor of the pork broth because of how sweet it was. I'm not sure if thai food from this region leans on the sweeter end. I would recommend this place for folks with a palate that leans on the sweeter side. The papaya salad and the basil stir fry were also sweet. The sticky rice was a bit too mochi-esque because the grains seemed mushed together."
1719,"Good for a quick meal. Got the crab fried rice, added shrimp and a fried egg. Good not great, average and as expected. Thai Tea is also as expected. Seating outdoor is very nice."
1720,Came here for the first time on a Friday night and luckily I made reservations a month in advance.I was party of one and apparently their tradition here is that if you are a party of one for any meal breakfast lunch or dinner there is a complementary glass of champagne. So that was a pleasant surprise.I want the traditional route with steak and fries and escargot. I desperately wanted dessert however I was so incredibly full from the appetizer and the main entrée as well as utilizing the bread to soak up the escargots sauce.I would definitely come back and I'm glad I waited this long to come here as I really only wanted to visit true New York institutions on this recent visit.Service was impeccable both from my actual assigned waiter as well as the peripheral support staff. Everyone is super attentive even other waiters who are not assigned to me.I would definitely come back as the ambience is chic and quintessential French bistro and brasserie.
1721,"This has become our standard Turkey Day lunch on our NYC visit. Cozy. Book early.We had an inexpensive Beaujolais that worked well with our food choices. Had the west coast oysters (kushi) - delish - and pate to start. Clear winners. Two of us did the prixe fixe ""turkey"" - beet salad (so so) and soup (winner); turkey platter - dark and white meat, ""stuffing"", mashed potatoes, and veggies""; and pecan and pumpkin pies. The other did the steak frites that was almost perfect other than it was only medium rare in the center.What was disappointing - one of the turkey entrees came out lukewarm and was heavy on dark meat that was very dry; service was not up to par.Overall a good experience and we'll be back but with this many guests and trying to flip tables, a few hiccups.....Food       4/5Service    3/5 Value       4/5Cleanliness   5/5Noise      3/5 (packed and as happy crowd!)Decor     4/5"
1722,"The vibes here are a ten out of ten and so is the service. We made reservations for 8 a.m. on a weekday, and my favorite part of this entire experience was the cool regular sitting next to me enjoying his bowl of espresso and bread while reading the newspaper.Everything about this place should give it five stars easily, but I honestly don't think it's worth the money to do brunch here. I want to go back and try there dinner, but $22.00 for average French Toast is not what I'm here for. I loved the bowl of coffee and the donut for me was just okay. My friends, however, loved the food. They were visiting from out of state and said they really enjoyed the food. I think being from this area, I've had really good brunch that's less expensive, but it's quite possible I just didn't order the right thing. The experience here is exceptional. They have indoor and outdoor seating and service is impeccable. You'll see lots of characters which I enjoy. If you are going here, I highly recommend making reservations and arriving a few minutes early even if you decide to go a 8:00 a.m. It's currently very beautifully decorated for the holidays. Perfect place to enjoy just a coffee and a pastry if you don't feel like spending money on a huge meal."
1723,"You go to Balthazar for the full experience.Although there's always a long wait (seems like there is a never ending line to eat here), the food is truly so good.Going in the winter truly puts you in the holiday spirit, with all of their wreaths and holiday decorations. The service is 10/10 -- everyone is friendly and super attentive! In terms of food, my friend and I got the escargot to share (the butter is the perfect dipping sauce for the complimentary bread) and it was so, SO GOOD. I got the macaroni au gratin (essentially, mac and cheese with truffle). When it arrived, I thought the portion size was on the smaller size, but as I took my first few bites, I realized how filling this dish was. Each bite is incredibly rich and luxurious -- truly a delight. My friend loved his omelette and said it was perfectly cooked. For dessert, we split a Creme Brulee and it was delicious. Overall, I'd come back here again. It is definitely pricey and the food is definitely rich, but it's a good meal and a great place to people watch."
1724,"I have nothing to add except but GET THE FRIES. I'm super particular when it comes to my fries, but they do it exactly right every time. I 10/10 recommend and I'm not even a fry guy."
1725,Such delicious French food fare here and such a lovely table setting indoor and outdoors! Escargots were decadent! I didn't waste a drip of the warm pesto sauce. French onion soup delighted the palate. All the dishes came out all at once. Steak tartare was spot on. Proportions for the small size was bigger than I thought. Duck confit was savory! White wine went smoothly well! I loved every dish that was ordered up and service was attentive thoroughly. Bon appetit!
1726,"Went yesterday and I was extremely impressed. I typically don't get French food too often, but if I ever were again... I'm coming right here. We started with a few dirty martinis, and they were smooth. Then we went with a dozen East Coast Oysters & they were super juicy and rich. We split a Duck Confetti and Moules Frites and both were so delectable. The Duck could of had a little more meat on it, but its Duck and it was so flavorful and cooked perfectly. The Mussels were excellent too (especially the sauce at the bottom... save that table bread for them). 5/5 stars no doubt about it... just be ready to spend a little more than a casual dinner"
1727,"Tried here on Friday morning. We were a little late for our 9:30am reservation but there seemed to be ample seating. We ordered the brioche French toast and the Gruyère cheese omelette with home fries. Our server was nice, but failed to check on us. I had to ask 3 different servers to bring us ketchup and didn't get it until we were done with our meal. Food was ok- not super memorable or amazing- but average. Won't be back as there are so many other places to try in NYC!"
1728,"This place isn't a staple for nothin'! The fact that people are constantly clambering to eat, drink and socialize at Balthazar makes so much sense now! During a holiday week, I stopped in initially for a cocktail and ended up staying for a full course. The energy was high, the servers were constantly running back and forth ensuring their tables were fulfilled and happy. The drinks were flowing and the food, delectable! Its best to have a reservation, thankfully I lucked out on this evening. Nestled in SoHo, steps from the subway off of Broadway, its very easy to get to. This particular evening, I started with the Hamachi Crudo, which was sliced and seasoned to perfection - Just enough salt to not overpower the dish, but just enough to allow the flavors to melt on your tongue. For the entree, I decided on the beef short ribs, which were tender and flavorful. Do yourself a favor and hop on in if you ever get the chance to indulge in the experience!"
1729,"I don't know what is there to say about this place that hasn't been said before, so I'll keep it short. Our server was great, and the food and drinks all came promptly. The cocktails were really yummy but I felt there was too much ice in them. The tables are really close together, but they don't seat all tables so we actually had a whole empty table between us and another occupied table, so I felt okay. They do check your vaccine card too."
1730,"OH. EM. YUM.We went here for a girls lunch midweek and ordered a glass of wine and a variety of the app/starters.  Everything we had was delicious and we left extremely full.  Bread is Life is, well, amazing.  Don't knock it until you try it.  The pork belly with whiskey side is literally a shot of whiskey to dip it in, and now I know how I will eat pork belly from now on.  The service was great and they timed out our food perfectly."
1731,Another restaurant to return to... loved the drink options and the beet salad was delicious.Make a reservation! Or you may get lucky with outdoor seating for dinner.
1732,Really an iconic and wonderful experience in both food and service. I highly recommend as a place to go if you are visiting NYC. And don't forget to get the profiteroles for desert!
1733,"This place is an absolute hidden gem! From the outside you wouldn't think much of it. I decided to come here on a whim. I had some time to kill and pass by everyday before work. I'm a med student so I showed up in scrubs and my bulky text book. I ordered a glass of rose and the waitress came out with the glass I ordered and a glass of champagne. I tried to explain I didn't order that and she said it's complimentary, anyone dining alone gets a glass of champagne. I thought that was so sweet. The food was Devine and I definitely will be returning"
1734,"Balthazar has excellent service and yummy, light french fare! We made a reservation for 1 PM and were promptly seated at 12:51 PM. My frozen rosé was very refreshing and not too alcoholic. My lunch partners honeybee drink was a little strong and very tasty. The niçoise salad was delicious! I think the tuna should have been seared a little harder so that the outside would have a better crust and the inside should be more raw; otherwise the texture is mushy. There was an additional fish in my salad that was very salty when eaten alone so I would recommend cutting it up to eat in several bites. The rest of the salad was lightly dressed and very fresh and had great contrasting textures and flavors! My lunch partner ordered the Norwegian eggs Benedict, which was both light and hearty. The hollandaise sauce was creamy yet light, and the eggs were poached perfectly. Lastly, the chocolate mousse was incredible. Not too sweet (so important!), layered in flavor and composition with hazelnuts breaking up the texture. I really enjoy how all of our food here was both light and filling; it makes for a great lunch stop. Our server was super cheerful and easy going too; very warm atmosphere. I would return!"
1735,"Service was excellent! I really enjoyed my scallops, mushroom ravioli, and sea bass. Everything had a great sauce and was seasoned well. The scallops melted in your mouth and was on top of a bed of Brussels sprouts that added a nice texture. As well the crispy skin on the sea ass that was served on top of a bed of onion and carrots made it feel stew like and balanced the dish so nicely. As well the mushroom ravioli was so rich and I could definitely see myself eating this everyday if there were no consequences. As well the banana ricotta tart at the end was rich and tasty. Imo it needed a little tartness, but it was still really good."
1736,"Ok so I've seen this spot so many times. Walked past it, seen it on yelp, and kind of thought it was just a hyped up place.But decided to finally come here for a bday brunch w my friends, u know 2022 is all abt changes and spur of the moment tingz. Friend called and found out they only have brunch menu on the wkends, wkday is lunch menu which didnt look too much of a difference to us! Got here on a Monday (holiday) and there was a line just to put ur name down for a table lol things were lookin grim for us..Got to the counter and the male host told us to come back in abt 20 mins and we'll have a table! Needless to say, 20 mins we were back and seated!Guys, the service, the food, the service and did i mention the service?--was amazing!Totally forgot our servers name but we had a female initially then switched to a male by the time our entree came. Maybe shift change?Anyways, we ordered the escargot (so good with lemon/buttery sauce! Ask for more bread to dip!!!) and someone got the steak frites (amazing! Tender steak cooked perfectly and fries u def dont want to share!), mac n cheese (couldve probably skipped this lol), and norweigan eggs benedict! It came with one egg that was boiled and one egg that was poached, so odd! But nonetheless, still very good!!! We also got a side order of fries cos.. again.. u wont want to share. Lol apple pie w vanilla ice cream to finish off a wonderful lunch!We loved both our servers. They were friendly and joked around w us the whole time. Thank you for a great lunch experience!!!"
1737,"Balthazar Ratings: 4.3/5Food: 4.5/5 - My friend and I decided to try this place out, and it was definitely worth the wait and sitting at the bar. We decided to do family style and share two appetizers and one entree. The French Onion soup was phenomenal, super cheesy and tasty. There were bread in the soup as well, filling and satisfying; perfect as a starter, just wished it was hotter. The escargots was wonderful. The sauce was buttery, garlicky, and so freaking flavorful. Literally all you could ask for in a escargot dish. I love how fatty, juicy, and meaty the escargots were, definitely one of the better escargots I have had in a while. We had to dip our bread into the rest of the garlic butter, we literally devoured that sauce. For entree, we got the NY Strip Steak with spinach and pommes frites. Pro tip for ordering steak here is to add peppercorn on the steak and ask for the steak sauce on the side, you can thank me later seriously. I love the steak, amazing and super tender, and cooked perfectly, just like how I like it:  medium rare. The fries was also outstanding, crispy and delightful, not heavy at all. The only downside was the spinach was a bit too salty. The complimentary bread was also a bit hard, just wish it was toasted, then this meal would have been perfect. Ambiance: 4.25/5 - At the center of SOHO, always buzzing with many people standing outside waiting to get in to try their food. Interior is huge with antique decor and a diner feel. The tables are pretty close together, and they do seat everyone at every table, so definitely feel pretty occupied and tight. We sat at the bar, because that is the only spots available. Also, it can be a bit loud, but love the vibe anyways so I don't mind. There's also a lot of outdoor seating available, but there's always a wait. This is a great spot for dates or visitors in NYC, since it's a famous place. Price: 4/5 - Relatively on the expensive side, but definitely worth a try. We got two appetizers; the escargots for $23 and the French Onion Soup for $19. For entree, my friend and I shared the NY Strip Steak with spinach and fries for $49. The total came up to be around $130 after tax and tips. We got the chocolate mousse dessert for free from a random guy sitting next to us at the bar, so we have no idea how much that cost. The meal was worth the price, since food was tasty and high-quality, so I am not complaining at all.  Service: 4.25/5 - I like the staffs and the bartenders here. Service was great and appreciate the charm and welcoming vibe each person was giving off. I like how the manager was able to sat us at the bar, instead of making us wait for 90 minutes, since we didn't have a reservation. Everyone seems to be energetic and know what they were doing. Our server provided us with water and complimentary bread while we wait for our food. The appetizers and entrees all came out at a reasonable time and pipping hot too. BLUF: A classic NYC staple. Nothing feels more quintessentially NYC than dining at Balthazar in SOHO. Food was absolutely delicious and very high-quality ingredients. Loved the NYC strip steak and their fries, also their Onion soup and escargots are all a MUST order. Definitely go and treat yourself to some good food."
1738,"Don't know how it's taken me so long to try Balthazar - great food and overall experience! Yummy bread and fries!  Great outdoor seating. I tried the halibut ratatouille - at first I had the sauce on the side and found it to be kinda bland and dry, but after adding the sauce to the dish, I loved it.  Also enjoyed the French onion soup - excellent flavor - though there was too much cheese and not enough broth.  Correct those issues and it would be the perfect bowl of French onion soup! I'd definitely return!"
1739,Got the steak Frites and the fries seemed dried out an old like they were from the previous day. They also seemed like fast food fries and were cold. The steak was also not that warm and was so tough you could hardly chew it. We also got the ravioli which is fine but just really basic like could've cooked it at home and nothing was that impressive as far as the food. The servers were really nice and the atmosphere is beautiful
1740,"Beautiful decorations, great food, and great service! All sorts of food, avocado curry is the special and you cannot miss thep wings!"
1741,The food was really good! Loved the masaman curry and tofu drunken noodles. So yummy. I recommend this place
1742,This restaurant had really great service. It had really nice ambience. 10/10 Would come again.
1743,"Was not disappointed when we picked this place on our way to Central Park. We came in a big group of 15 but was split into 3 tables. Sadly, the only downfall is that I had 3 other people on my table so we couldn't try much of the dishes that was on the menu.We ordered:- Pak Mor Dumplings- Crab Fried Rice- Mamassan Curry- Steamed Branzino- Tom Yum- Tom KhaEverything was up to the standard of a good Thai restaurant and the Steamed Branzino took the prize. It was not too spicy and was just the right amount of sour to keep your taste buds tingling. Definitely, pop by when you have the chance and try some of their cocktails as well. My lunch was paired well with On Cloud 9!"
1744,"Only thing that didn't make this place a 5 star for me was the fact that they don't offer desserts. Came here last night with my sister and was immediately seated, no wait which was a plus considering how packed they were. Food smelled so amazing and tasted great. I got the drunken noodle with shrimp my sister got the pineapple fried rice with shrimp. For cocktails she had the On Cloud 9 I believe it was called and I got the Red Hot Lady, no complaints for the drinks either. I see how they are able to get people in an out of the seats though because our experience near the end was a bit rushed. However, still overall a great place and will be coming back!"
1745,"Wowza, first off I have to say the interior of this place is absolutely beautiful and highly recommend eating inside.Got the chicken pad Thai which was awesome, greta flavor, noodles cooked perfectly, good balance. My favorite though was the crab fried rice, it had so much flavor and so much tender and delicious crab, it was so amazing. Don't let the $30 price tag (as of this writing, no guarantee on inflation) scare you, it was absolutely worth it. Definitely need to go back and try the cocktails and pair it with that crab fried rice. Highly recommend this place, I'd definitely go back."
1746,"Came here on a Sunday with my friend and had a great time. Wait was really short, parking was not hard to find at all. The servers were really nice and friendly! I ordered the beef pad Thai and my friend ordered the beef pad see ew. We also got the fried calamari. Food came in a timely manner and it was very fresh! I would definitely come again!"
1747,"Really delicious food and cocktails! We got many of the apps to split and the highlights were the Kra-Pow puffs and chive pancakes - would highly recommend either or both! The crab Rangoons were pretty typical and the pork buns were okay - a bit too chewy. I got the red curry with chicken and it was so good, however, it lacked the spice I usually prefer. Despite that, the flavors were there and the portion was large enough to split into two meals. Everyone else got an array of entrees (drunken noodles, rice, pad Thai) and enjoyed their choices. We went as a group of 5 on a Friday and they had closed the wait list but we were able to get seated within 30 minutes of arriving. Definitely get there early if you have a larger group! Overall, solid meal with decent prices for the portions. I'd return if I'm in the neighborhood again!"
1748,"Met a friend here for dinner and was so impressed with the flavors, food and atmosphere.It's very whimsical with the flowers and they have a lovely COVID- friendly set up.We ordered the park mor dumplings (SO BEAUTIFUL), the chive pancake, Thai iced tea, pad kee mao and the massaman curry.My favorite was probably the park mor (peanut) dumplings. I've never had this type of dumpling before. Not only was it visually stunning but it had such a beautiful taste!I won't lie- I was expecting something different when I ordered the chive pancakes as these tasted like mochi on the inside. That being said, they were absolutely delicious. The contrasting textures between the crispy fried exterior and the chewy inside was awesome.The drunken noodles were good, nothing out of this world but they definitely satisfied my drunken noodle craving.The Massaman curry was everything. Light, spicy, sweet- delicious!The Thai iced tea was not very large and was mostly ice, but still good.I felt like for the area and quality of food, the prices were pretty good! This spot teetered between 4-5 for me but what edged it closer to the 5 was the over-all ambiance, playful yet rustic interior, attentive service and Covid safety precautions.I definitely plan on returning to try some additional dishes.4.8/5"
1749,Easy waitlist booking. Less than 10 minutes in a Saturday. Staff was very accommodating and helpful. Thep platter is good enough to share for 3 people to try each. Cut things into halfI liked my Pla Rad Prik: crispy branzino and pineapple with sweet chili sauce. Very flavorful and a large portion. I tried the rice berry rice. It was okay. Not a must. My mom and aunt did not like the pad Thai. Said it didn't have much flavor. My mom also ordered The pineapple rice and said it was a bit to soft
1750,"I think I may have a new favorite Thai restaurant on the UES. I've been to Thep a few times recently and I've found it to be consistently good. Their outdoor seating is COVID friendly- they have cute individual enclosed ""huts"". They also have a patio that's currently enclosed with heaters. I really like their chive pancakes. They are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The inside has a chew to it and a balanced (not overpowering) chive flavor. It's accompanied by a soy dipping sauce. Good to share!Avocado massaman chicken curry- comes two ways: with on the bone chicken or thin sliced white meat chicken. I tried both and both are good yet definitely different. Not surprisingly the chicken on the bone has a more pronounced flavor, however I found it harder to eat in the curry sauce (I also didn't have a knife). If you typically get the white meat boneless version maybe you will want to try the one on the bone for a change. I think I do slightly prefer the boneless version in this application. Thep's massaman curry comes with onion, avocado and peanuts like many other restaurant's version of this dish, however Thep uses sweet potatoes instead of white ones and I really enjoyed this! I'll definitely be back to dine at Thep!"
1751,"Thep was a HIT , we were here celebrating my nephew landing a role on the hit Amazon prime show Marvelous Mrs. Maisel , this dinner was amazing,  we didn't wait long at all to be seated for a party of 5 , the servers were very courteous and friendly. The drinks were strong , we had strawberry Margaritas and Lychee martinis.  the apps were tasty and a great portion size. Dinner was spot on and delicious, everything was hot and flavorful. Check the pics for our assortment. Free Thai iced tea with a Yelp review for the Win!!"
1752,"I came here for dinner on a Friday night with high hopes. I had heard so much about the restaurant and had seen pictures so assumed that the food and service would be top notch. Thai food is also one of my favorite cuisines so I really had high expectations coming in.My initial impression when I came in was ""wow this place is so cute!"" They had tons of flower decorations on the ceilings and some other decor that made the place look great. I also appreciated the dividers between each table for COVID precautions - lots of places have since gotten rid of the big dividers so it was nice to see that Thep Thai kept them.Once we sat down, we noticed that there was an option on the menu to get a free Thai iced tea/coffee - so we asked the server what we needed to do to get this. Just like at Viv Thai, they asked that we write a Yelp review and then we could pick either the tea or coffee. I honestly don't think this is an ethical practice because you shouldn't be bribing your customers with freebies in exchange for reviews. It made me question if the reviews at this restaurant were slightly misleading or overly positive?We ended up ordering the Avocado massaman curry and the drunken noodles. The drunken noodles were delicious - but the portion size was tiny. I've never seen such a small serving for noodles, especially at an Asian restaurant. Considering the low cost of noodles, I would have expected more. I also wish that the tofu in the dish were fried instead of soft.For some reason, they prepared our avocado massaman curry extremely spicy... It was so spicy that I couldn't even eat it. I was sweating. The rice was also very dry and didn't look or taste fresh. Not sure why they prepared this curry with so much spice but when we let them know, they just kind of laughed it off and didn't say much. The same goes for the rice - we asked if they were preparing the food fresh (our order came out so fast, it was extremely suspicious) and the servers just laughed at us.Because of how spicy the curry dish was prepared, we had to order another dish - and we picked the pad thai, because we knew this would not be spicy. When we got this order, there was absolutely no flavor in the noodles. They were completely bland. So, we ended up with one dish that was far too spicy and one that was flavorless.In the end, we left pretty disappointed and decided that we wouldn't be returning. Not only were we unsatisfied with the strange melange of flavor palettes (too spicy versus flavorless), but we were also shocked by the service.. If a customer complains, shouldn't you take them seriously instead of laughing at them?"
1753,"Came here on Saturday noon. We didn't have to wait to get seated. They have indoor and outdoor seatings.We started with duck salad. The duck was tender and the salad was sour. It was very refreshing with pineapple. For the entrees we got seafood green curry and pork belly clay pot. Green curry was rich, spicy, and tasty! For the seafood part, they already peeled shrimps for you so we could eat them easily. As for the clay pot, it was so unique and special that I've never had this kind of dish in NY! The bottom was marinated rice with yam, taro, pumpkin, sausage, postage (maybe? Lol). It had many toppings. The rice was topped with pork belly, bok choy, osen egg, and flat noodles! The dish was very flavourful and the toppings were generous. Both entree were big portion for us. Overall, I will come back again. Both service and food were great. PS - write a review on Google or Yelp to receive a free drink!"
1754,"Such a pretty place! We got seated in the outside private rooms which kept us nice and warm. Service is so fast and the servers are wonderful. We   got the the duck curry, tom kha, red curry and  khao soi. Everything thing was perfect especially on a cold day! Definitely come here to try their food!"
1755,I had pad Thai. We sat outside in the wooden houses and the heater didn't keep it as warm as I'd like. I enjoyed the Thai tea.
1756,"The ambience was really unique, a lot of plants & floral canopies. It was nice to see a place with clear dividers for COVID precautions I'm a bit biased since I've gone to Thailand a lot & was expecting authentic flavors since all the workers spoke Thai. The khao soi was flavorful but not as flavorful as it could be. The chicken on the bone in the massaman curry seemed a bit undercooked and not very well seasoned. But overall everything was presented gorgeously."
1757,"Great Thai spot in the upper east side!  We stopped here for lunch and immediately noticed the beautiful decor. DECOROnce you immediately walk in, you notice the lush plants/flowers dangled over the ceiling lights and the beautiful decor. Ambiance is great for catching up with friends or going on a date. They have an outdoor patio area and outdoor little cabins, which would be great when the weather warms up.  Tables are spaced pretty tightly, but they have plastic dividers in between tables.FOOD*Park Mor ($12) - The peanut thai dumpling in butterfly pea crepe was light and tasty.  It was interesting to try.*Kra-Pow Puff ($12) - The puff pastry was delicious.  I don't think I've ever tried one with cheese and minced pork. The cucumber vinagrette dipping sauce was a nice pairing*Shrimp Pad Thai ($18) -  A classic Thai dish and one of my personal favorites!  I thought it was a little pricey for pad thai, but the portion was pretty big, and had ample for leftovers.  While I enjoyed the dish overall, it was a bit too tangy and salty for my taste.  *Thai Iced Coffee ($4) - This was my first time trying it and it was pretty good.SERVICEService was attentive and quick right after we put in our order. If you're ever in the area, I would definitely recommend giving them a try!"
1758,"hmmm.. do I really recommend Thep Thai when there is another Thai restaurant that is less than a block away, better food, and also has affordable lunch specials?This place is definitely an instagrammable place, but I think they are overpriced.Thep thai is now offering a promotion; you get a free drink (thai tea/ thai coffee or soda) if you write a review for them. I think this is why their food price is high? Their pad thai starts from $16 which is pretty high compare to other thai places in nyc. pad thai did not have much flavor, but big portion though."
1759,"Most enjoyed the drunken noodles. They were like blankets in my mouth. The spice level was perfect  the sweet potato pad Thai was good, but didn't realize the sweet potatoes weren't chunks but the actual noodle  The pork belly was juicy and thicc. ""The proportion of meat and rice was not correct though"" - Hannah, happy customer ""It was resting on a field of rice"" - Crystal, another happy customer Thai iced tea was delicious and they also have a good assortment of cocktails."
1760,"I'm rarely in the UES, but glad I found this great Thai restaurant! They have a bunch of outdoor dining 'cabins' set up and I believe there are also walls between each table as well.We ordered the krapow puffs, pineapple fried rice, red curry, lychee thai iced tea, and the coffee or me drink. I would skip the pineapple fried rice, but how could we resist the presentation? The curry was my absolute favorite and the krapow puffs were also really good. The lychee thai iced tea wasn't crazy sweet, which I prefer. The coffee or me drink was extremely strong - so I would assume the same for their other alcoholic drinks hahaWould definitely come back and try out some of their other dishes!"
1761,"Thep is a neighborhood classic and arguably the best Thai choice in the UES. Beautiful floral decor and inviting vibes. The staff was super friendly. Food was great. You HAVE to try the Short Rib Massaman, definitely the best thing we had that night. I think you could safely pass on the Shrimp Fried Rice, it could use some more flavor. The Park Mor dumplings are beautiful, but make sure you really like peanuts if you order them. Drinks were beautiful and tasty. Overall great experience!"
1762,"THEP is a delight! Service is fantastic but not overbearing, ambiance is delightful, and the food is the true highlight of the show. We ordered the thep platter (two of many appetizers - the chive cakes were lovely - the right texture and chewiness) and the massaman short rib. The short rib came with these lovely sweet potatoes and plenty of onions that made it so savory!"
1763,"I have had many excellent meals here. It is one of the best Thai spots in the neighborhood. I also love that they have expanded their outdoor dining to include a patio (currently enclosed during the winter but open air in the summer) and colorful dining huts. My favorite dishes here are the papaya salad, green curry, and pineapple fried rice. My husband loves the lemongrass pork chop and the basil fried rice with duck. You really can't go wrong with anything here. The drinks are also very tasty- both the Thai iced teas and the cocktails. The prices are reasonable, and it has a trendy but also casual vibe. We will continue to come back!"
1764,"Best Thai food that I've had on the UES! I went here twice in one week and both experiences were great. The first time I dined in with a friend. We did not have a reservation but were able to get in easily on a Wednesday evening around 7 PM. They do have heated outdoor seating however those tables are only for groups of four or more. As a party of two we were given the option to sit inside or on their porch which was heated but still very cold! I would recommend sitting inside as the heating lamps that were provided were not sufficient enough. The food was phenomenal we had the lemon wings and dumplings for appetizers. I had the avocado curry with shrimp which was spicy but not too spicy that it wasn't enjoyable. The service is very quick and friendly.My second time here we ordered takeout and my friend picked it up. They had an issue finding our order since we had ordered on GrubHub. Luckily, after about 15 minutes they were able to find our meals. This time I ordered the green curry which was also delicious; I like this one better than the avocado curry. I was impressed to find that the quality of the dish was the same as when I had dined in.Overall, this is the Thai place to beat for me so far on the UES. Check them out!"
1765,You can order almost anything off the menu and it's going to be satisfying and delightful. The space is quaint and just lovely to be in. I  wish that service matched the beautiful decor. I felt tense and rushed while I was here
1766,"Cute place in the UES!  We had the chicken pad see ew, chicken ginger joy, park mor peanut dumplings, Thai iced tea and the red hot lady tequila cocktail.  Chicken was a bit dry, but both entrees were packed with flavor.  The peanut dumplings were so tasty -- sweet and savory at the same time.  The drinks were not overly sweet.  Good spot for Thai food, would visit again."
1767,"TLDR: amazing ambience with heaters, excellent and friendly service, good for large groups (with private rooms), delicious food with gorgeous presentation, lots of nice looking seasonal specials as well Came with my sister, a native to this area who recommended this place to me and I can see why. The Kra-Pow Puff was fantastic, stuffed with plenty of chicken and cheese that was sure to take you on a trip. Same with the golden satchets (crab and chicken). Just be mindful the dipping sauce is sticky! Don't worry there's plenty of hand sanitizer and a cloth to go around.Entrees were fantastic: I love drunken noodles and this one hits it home for any lover of this Thai dish. It's a generous portion size with lots of beef too! Pad Thai was also authentic and also a generous portion (my sister could barely finish it)Overall I would come again and explore more of the seasonal options too!"
1768,"OVERRATED!Pretty much all show and no go. Not really sure how this place has 4.5 stars unless the chef recently changed or the quality has just plummeted since covid.Park mor (butterfly pea dumpling) - pretty much just pretty to look at, not much peanut flavor on the inside, blandGolden sachet - also aesthetically pleasing but not much crab flavorDuck salad - way less duck than is advertised in the photo on the menu, slightly dry duck, papaya salad was fineKhao soi - chicken on the bone completely bland, no flavor cooked into the chicken, coconut curry was fine but the dish just felt like all of its soul had been sucked out by a dementorPla rad prik (crispy branzino) - half crispy, half soggy, needs to be way crispier for $38, was told that the dish is normally spicy but it was blandThe servers didn't check on our table once after the food was served. Someone from my table had to get up and enter the restaurant to ask a server for something because nobody was coming by. Didn't even ask how we enjoyed the food when settling the bill. Overall, the entire meal was bland, lacking any real flavor, spice, soul, or passion. I don't know if the chef is trying to appeal to the average American palate but please stop.Very disappointing."
1769,"Decided to check this place out upon yelp research! I came to dine in with my friend and ordered calamari, pad see ew and pad kee mao for lunch. Portion is very generous and enough to fill two grown up men. The calamari and shrimp in pad see ew were also very fresh as you can see in the photo attached. I just wished it had little more sauce on it. Will definitely come back again though"
1770,Phenomenal Thai! Service was amazing and food was unmatched. Loved the dumplings and the pad Thai. I would ask for extra spice if you want it spicy though - it comes very mild. The ambiance is nice for a date or a girls night out. I would recommend a jacket on their heated patios though we wore ours through the dinner.
1771,"Craving Thai but also feeling a night club type of vibe? Then THEP is your spot. Loud music, strong drinks, lively patrons. There's a lot  going on in this little restaurant. If you're celebrating a birthday with a big group this would be a great option with a loud music, a variety of drinks and IG worthy plating. If you're looking for an intimate date setting. This is not it as I could hardly hear what my friend across from me was saying.This place is so popular! Make sure to make reservations or wait up to an hour to get seated! With a lot of delicious options I can see why. I love Peking duck and pad si eww. Put the two together and I'm sold! The duck skin was perfectly crispy and the pad si eww was delicious. They have many sink options and why my friends ordered wine and cocktails just went with a simple beer. They didn't have many options but had a bottled Brooklyn lager. Definitely a fun choice if you're looking for a lively atmosphere but pass on it if you're looking for an intimate dinner."
1772,"I have been here twice & hve left happy & satisfied !!Portions are great & the food is delicious!! They accommodate the dish to your preference.. which is so sweet! I order the Tom Kha w only American Broccoli, it is some of the best .. the broth is so yum & flavor hits evry tastebud!!  Green Curry extra Thai spicy w only American Broccoli also a great option!! it comes w a side of rice if yr into tht !! The customer service is good & they are very attentive. It's a small space but they use it to their advantage with the use of plexiglass separators.I love this spot & will definitely be back many more times.As soon as I'm done, I'm already thinking of when I will return"
1773,"Having gotten delivery from this Thai restaurant, it was a no brainer to choose this spot for a lunch spot with friends in the UES. Came here on a weekday around 2pm, 90 minutes before they closed their lunch service.We split an order of the THEP Platter ($19) to start. It consisted two of a combination of golden sachets, spring rolls, chive pancakes, fried chicken dumplings, and fried shrimp dumplings. Since there was three of us, it was semi tough deciding how to split everything.For entree, I ordered the Sweet Potato Pad Thai ($20) and added chicken for extra $2. This consisted of sautéed sweet potato noodles with tofu, egg, sweet radish, Chinese chives, bean sprouts topped with toasted sesame, mixed nuts, fried garlic and shallots. Never had sweet potato noodles so I was intrigued by it. Certainly super healthy and great for those on a diet.Also good to note that they offer incentives, such as a free drink, for a Yelp, Google, TripAdvisor, etc. review. This explains the amount of high rated Yelp reviews because they put the customers on the spot to write one immediately for the free item. So take these reviews with a grain of salt."
1774,"Great vibe!The entrance is beautiful and the staff was very nice. Overall, it was a great outing!"
1775,Great great food! I loved the crab Rangoon and the summer rolls and the calamari! The Thai tea was also delicious and even better it was free because I left a Google review. All of the plates and cutlery are gold and super unique. The atmosphere on the j side and outside was super chic. Will for sure be back.
1776,"Asked for our food allergies and very courteous wait staff. Short line for dinner, and the place is very large and can accommodate a large group. The decor is fitting and has a good atmosphere!"
1777,"The place was decorated nicely, very aesthetic. Everything was good and the fish was the best. The only thing I didn't really like was the tom kha."
1778,Great thai spot on the UES. We got thai tea & coffee and both were excellent as well as the chicken pad thai and avocado massaman curry. The noodles & curry were both pretty good. Would definitely come again if I'm in the area.
1779,"All time favourite Thai spot on the upper east side! You literally can't ever go wrong with this place. The restaurant has a great vibe, super cute seating inside and outside and amazing food. I got the spicy udon noodles which were so so flavourful! It is my favourite dish in this restaurant and I always get it. We also got the panang curry which was amazing. Perfect combination of all flavours cooked in coconut milk. Go check this place out if you're on the UES looking for some good Thai food!"
1780,"Unique presentation of all the Thai dishes!! To start we had the Park Mor (beautiful layout but a little too sweet for a savory dish) and Kra-Pow (get this, too die for!!) appetizers. Then shared the Pork Belly Clay Pot (play on Chinese clay pot, very fun to eat) from their Chef's recommendation list.Overall great service and would come again to try their other dishes!"
1781,"I came here on a Friday night to catch up with old friends and we were seated right away although it is usually busy. We were seated in a patio by Som, who is incredibly attentive and kind. The food and drink menu had so much variety. I ordered the Pad Thai, which was great. We enjoyed our drinks as well. Overall, highly recommend. Would definitely want to come back and try other menu options!"
1782,"Walked in the THEP for lunch and was super pleasantly surprised. The decor was cute and aesthetically pleasing, the wait staff were attentive and friendly. But most importantly, the food was INCREDIBLE. They have so many vegetarian and vegan options, I wish I could have tried everything on the menu! I ordered the Pom & Bubble cocktail, Tom Kha with tofu, and the Cashew King with tofu. Highly recommend, 5/5 on every aspect."
1783,"Outside/ indoor seating vax cards needed for indoor seating. Outdoor seating no vax card shown  Great food and service.  Had the Thep ravioli as an appetizer and the duck pad see eww as main. My server Kate was awesome. Made great suggestions as this was my first time dining here. I think for the price point portions are a bit tiny, but food is good. I will return when I want small portions and not so hungry and local.. Give it a try."
1784,"Had a wonderful experience and dinner last night. First, the restraunt is located on a corner and has indoor and outdoor seating.  It is decorated with twinkling lights and greenery. As soon as you walk in you notice the ambience and thrle cool vibe.  They have a bar with 5 or 6 seats for drinks or eating. There were so many food options we wanted to try it was hard to settle on one.  Their menu ..which is online..has corresponding pictures, which was very helpful. We started with a fresh roll. Their food presentation is delightful.  The rolls were fresh and crisp . The sauce had a touch of ginger, just enough not to be overpowering.  The cashew king with chicken came with a mound of rice . The food is displayed with an artistic flair.  The chicken was so tender and flavorful.  There were alot of veggies,  carrots, peppers etc and the dish was amazing.  The sauce was sweet, but also had a bit of teriyaki . My daughter had the pork belly.  The waitress poured the sauce over it at the table with such flair.  The pork was tender and surrounded a large mound of rice.  The pork was so lean and tender.  We had a wonderful dinner and definitely would return.  We did join the waitlist and was seated promptly."
1785,"Came by the restaurant after playing badminton. It seemed really popular as it was fully packed with people waiting outside as well but the wait wasn't long. Cute interior and nice plate arrangements. My friend told me it's not true authentic but more like fusion, tho it was nice. The Thep platter was my favorite. The fish was a bit too sour and spicy for us. The duck curry was ok but personally don't love the sweetness. The salad was nice but very ""normal""."
1786,"My friend and I arrived on a Saturday when they opened at 12PM, which was a good move because there was no wait for their highly coveted private heated cabins that are a whitish tan in color, glass cut outs and little lights strewn throughout. I loved this outdoor dining experience... The craftsmanship was simply beautiful! In addition, we felt warm and cozy while enjoying our lunch on a cold winter day. I ordered the lemongrass pork chop, which was marinated with honey lemongrass sauce, served with steamed coconut sticky rice and steamed bok choy, along with snap peas. This was gorgeously plated, with 2 full sized grilled premium cut of pork on top of the green veggies, and the sticky rice, which was purple in color, was separate in a lovely copper bowl. The pork had perfect grill marks and were marinated in the tasty, slightly sweet sauce. There was also flavorful seasoning added throughout. The meat was delightfully tender, juicy, and succulent. The coconut sticky rice was satisfyingly chewy with a great glutinous consistency. There was a little bit of coconut flavor, but I would have liked more. The bok choy and snap peas were wonderfully crunchy and fresh. The vegetables came with a cucumber vinaigrette dipping sauce, which was light and enjoyable. Service was great and the waitresses were friendly, as well as on top of it. I would be open to returning. There are a few appetizing sounding menu items I would like to try, such as the Duck Tamarind, Thai Sausage Fried Rice, Honey Pork Rib, and Thep Platter (an assortment of appetizers)."
1787,Came here for lunch and enjoyed it! We got the paid Thai and spicy udon - highly recommend!
1788,Beautiful decor. Great food. Will return. Great service. Upper east side. Nice for lunch
1789,Love the ambience here. I usually avoid Thai food when eating outside because it's so accessible with takeout/delivery but this place is worth the exception! They have really unique entrees beyond the classics. We got the pork belly clay pot which was exceptional. The duck curry was also amazing!One more plus is that they take Yelp waitlist so it's perfect on a busy weekend night when you don't have an reservation
1790,"5 stars for the Banana pudding and chocolate pudding!!!! Better than Magnolia Bakery. Not too sweet but both very rich, creamy and perfect. It's an indulgence that is worth it!!"
1791,cupcake was tasty! Can be compared to magnolia butter cream cupcakes. This cupcake really hit the spot. I'll be back.
1792,"Excellent bakery! I had a great experience with this shop. They were able to make a custom birthday cake for my daughter, including making a design of her favorite cartoon character on the top of the cake. The end result looked fantastic and the cake was delicious. For a reasonable fee they offer delivery as well. Thankfully, the cake arrived in excellent condition. I would absolutely order from them again!"
1793,I'm 8 months pregnant and drove from Westchester just to get their pudding. Website says they have curbside. I call as we get close to have the order ready and paid for. Lady was so rude wouldn't make a one time exception to just bring to dessert outside. There is NO parking around here. I explained how far I drove etc and she would not run the dessert right outside. She said to look for parking that they only did curbside during covid. I'll never go back!
1794,Wow! The most amazing fluffy tasty cupcakes we've ever had! The best in all of NYC! -With love from Annie Anari
1795,"I only tried one of their cupcakes, the vanilla with vanilla icing and found it fairly average. It tasted similar to a grocery store cupcake, nothing too special. I loved the design of the store though and thought the people working there were very pleasant and kind. Maybe some other flavors would be better."
1796,"Just wanted to add a few things. Debbie, the owner, responded not just publicly, but also sent me two mean-spirited private messages. Ok, I expected this (see point #3 below). I'll end with this:1. I've written almost 350 reviews and this is the ONLY 1 star rating I've ever given. I really hate to be critical (I'd rather just keep it to myself in that case), but I have just never been treated so rudely - I've never been hung up on because I was asking about ingredients in a food product, especially to protect my pregnant sister. I called a couple of places before and after Sugar Sweet Sunshine and asked the same questions, multiple times, to make sure there were no raw eggs. No one else seemed bothered and certainly no one else hung up.2. Debbie seems to think that my asking the same question multiple times was insulting. No, it wasn't insulting. Perhaps overly cautious, but not insulting. How often does an employee accidentally say ""there are no nuts"" or ""this is gluten free"" because of a mistake or because they don't know? The guy who answered didn't introduce himself and say I've been here 8 years and I'm positive. How would I know his history with the company? In fact, he seemed not to be positive, so I felt more comfortable speaking with the baker/owner. I had NO idea that the baker/owner would be annoyed from the beginning at the fact that I was checking multiple times.If an employee accidentally get's this stuff wrong, that's a big problem for the person with celiac's disease, a nut allergy, or another health concern. It could send them to the hospital, so I think any amount of over caution is appropriate. In this case, it would be a big problem for my sister. That's why I was insistent. But not rude or condescending. I would never be to anyone, it's not who I am. And most definitely not with customers who are just wanting to ensure health and safety.3. If you want something entertaining to do, sort these reviews by the ""lowest rated."" You'll see that Debbie and/or her partner have respond aggressively to so many people who give low ratings. I just don't understand why they can't approach things with a ""hey sorry you didn't like this, hope we can do better next time"" attitude. Like I said originally, their puddings are good, so why not add good customer service on top? I wonder what other insults I'll receive now and I wonder if I should fear for my physical safety because Debbie scares me."
1797,"I stumbled upon this place while looking for a vegan bakery. The name alone sounded inviting so I stopped in to see what they had. They offer a variety of different cupcakes and cakes. I found there were a few options for vegan cupcakes. Mostly basic flavors, but the Cinnamon Toast Crunch was the one unique one so I gave it a go. Good stuff! The cashier was as sweet as the name of the bakery and added some vegan sprinkles too just to add a little extra! This place has been around for over 18 years and I just got to try it! Sweet staff and cupcakes just under $3 is great."
1798,"Today is my second visit to this special and magical space!Debbie assistead me yesterday and Peggy today. Do not deny yourself of these confectionery treats, in these uncertain times of Covid. If you're feeling low, this is the perfect place to go!!! You can walk, run or bike it off later!"
1799,The staff is so rude. Accused me of writing a bad review and verbally attacked me and kicked me outta the store! These people are crazy. Plus they don't wear masks or even wash hands. Be prepared to wait in line  forever and be treated like trash.  The owner Debbie is nuts and obviously a smoker. Scroll down and read about what a nut she is. Crazy. Will not return.
1800,Short ribs pho and Ox tail pho were really  impressive! Fried spring rolls are great too!  Cash only
1801,"I've been going to Saigon Shack for the past several years! As a regular customer, every time I visit the establishment, I order their Brisket Pho! One of the highlights of this item is the brisket itself! There's a great amount of meat in the pho! It's cooked to perfection and just the right amount of fat on the meat!The staff is very attentive and friendly! The service is very quick too, yet their food items are freshly made!Plus, the noodles are cooked perfectly. Usually, most dishes include seasonings, but this is one of the few places where you don't even have to add anything extra. It's authentic as it is! This is the best Vietnamese restaurant in NYC I've been to thus far!*Please note that the method of payment accepted at this establishment is CASH ONLY!(Date of Visit: March 16th, 2022)"
1802,"I wanted a banh mi. Saigon Shack sounded like a promising place to pick one up to eat in the park, and I'd heard good things about it. I walked in, and realized that this is not a shack by anyone's shack standards. This is not a grimy Vietnamese hole in the wall with nothing but tables, chairs, and a kitchen that is pumping out banh mi and pho all day long (as I assumed from the name and proximity to NYU). This is a very nice, clearly popular, and even trendy restaurant. There are plants, and glass jars filled with colorful produce, and an open kitchen that is pumping out banh mi and pho all day long. Of course this means that the banh mi is $12. But I was in the mood, so I came. I ordered myself a grilled pork sandwich to go (cash only), and sat down to wait at one of the tables when I realized I was just in the way standing there like an idiot. After waiting a few minutes, I realized I wasn't going to make it to the park, as I was entirely too hungry, so I asked if I could just eat at the table. ((Yes, I made it awkward for all the staff who didn't know how to treat me (TOGO customer or dine-in patron), but I did end up tipping 50% for being such a problem.))Now, I know many people that object to $12 banh mi on basic principle, and I feel that. I do. And I've eaten far too many $12 banh mi sandwiches in the past few years, because I live in NYC and I'm a sucker for them. But if you're going to eat a $12 banh mi, this is the $12 banh mi that you want. This is the banh mi that I want, full stop. This sandwich is BANGING. The bread is quality. The pickled veggies are piled high, and quality. The juicy pork chops are pounded thin, and taste like they were cooked to order, as they should be (sometimes you might get some sad, microwaved meat at the wrong spot). I asked for it to be medium spicy, and it was actually the perfect amount of heat for my wussy palate. I will be eating this sandwich again."
1803,This place is busyyy. Got there at 6:30pm on a Wednesday and waited 30 min for a table for 2. Food was ok. The fried egg rolls were ok but the fish sauce was lacking in flavor. I did appreciate that it came out with pre cut lettuce leaves though. Easy eating!The pho flavor was great but very very mild. If the flavor was stronger this spot would perfectt.If you prefer your pho flavors a bit on the mild side then this could be your new spot!
1804,"The vegetarian pho is very flavorful. The broth has a nice fresh taste (and not bland) and is even better with the siracha and hoisin. This was really satisfying because most vegetarian pho broths that Ive had aren't usually flavorful. So this was a major plus. Everything in the bowl tasted fresh and hearty. My only complaint is that they kinda skimped out on the soy protein. For a 15 -17 dollar pho, I was hoping for a bit more than one decent sized and three small chunks of soy protein :/"
1805,"Shared the fresh rolls and they were big, 4 rolls. I was almost full from just the rolls. Its basically the grilled pork vermicelli in a wrap. I got a classic pho and one of the best broths bc its already so good you dont need to add sriracha or hoison. If youre not paying cash, youll have to order from the app. Wait for just two people is short but it looked like the space is small And you could have to wait for a bigger table"
1806,"I came for a late lunch with a friend. Because of the slightly off lunch hours, it was not too packed or hard to get a table for us. However, it is a small space and the tables are also small so I can see it getting on the full side really easily. Just something I thought I would mention considering the times now. As for the food, well I can't complain. It was a cold winter day in January when I went, so getting a warm bowl of pho hit the spot. The broth was light but still flavorful, which I preferred. Also the noddles themselves were solid. Honestly, there was so much I could not finish. So quantity is not an issue either. Overall, decent place to get pho. Although, the selection of the type of pho is kind of limited. I do want to mention the service because wow were they speedy! My drink (vietnamese coffee) came out almost right after I ordered it and I think the pho came out within 5-10 minutes. So everything was really fast. Another thing worth mentioning is that they only take cash. Luckily, I had some on me so not an issue. They also have an atm right outside if you don't have any on you at the time."
1807,"Name something more satisfying than a warm bowl of pho on a cold day... I'll wait. Had a dinner here with my fam and was overall satisfied with our meal. The pho here is pretty good-- the broth so flavorful and the portion size is spot on. The pork chop is tender and juicy (just the way I like it!) Top it off with a Thai ice tea... ooof, you're all set! I was surprised that the place was PACKED on a Tuesday night. There was a constant stream of people of coming in and out, which is a testament to how loved this place is. We had to wait ~30 min, but the amazing service of the employees here made the wait bearable. They always updated us with how long we had left to wait, making us feel like they didn't forget us despite them being so busy. Keep in mind that the place is SMALL. Some parties had to share one table together, which is obviously not ideal but I appreciate them making the most of what they have. But don't let the small place fool you, this place is big on flavor and comfort Vietnamese food!! It's not the most authentic, but it's a hip place with solid food so you certainly cannot go wrong with this place!"
1808,"One of my favorite trendy Vietnamese restaurants in The Village! This is one of my sons favorite place and we always have to make a stop. I've never had a problem and the food is very good. Except this night there was a problem. I'm not going to ding them on it, but the issue needs to be noted.We came late on a Monday. Called ahead and they said they closed at 10 and it was 9 when we arrived -- it was very busy but we were able to be seated.Ordered 2 orders of Spring Rolls and 2 Veggie Phos.The Summer Rolls were excellent. Come 2 pieces to an order cut in half. They are packed with veggies, 2 large shrimp, pork, and rolled in rice paper. The peanut dipping sauce is excellent.15 minutes after the spring rolls came, the waitress came to the table to let us know they were out of veggies for the Veggie Pho. My husband changed his order to Chicken Pho and my son asked if they were totally out of vegetables. Since they still had other vegetables, he asked if they could just substitute the ones on hand. A few minutes later the two large bowls of Pho came to the table. We asked for the bean sprouts and basil for the pho and they brought the plate to the table minus the basil since they were out.Ok...so here comes the issue. My son looked up from his bowl and said he was glad he wasn't a vegetarian because there was chicken in his bowl. We laughed about it, but they need to be careful. I know some vegetarians who wouldn't have thought it was funny.Cash only here unless you order on the app and then you can use a credit card."
1809,"Perfect night for pho. There was already a wait at 5pm. Sat at the counter and got the Classic Beef Pho plus the fried spring rolls. The pho great and got plenty of beef. Wish they had jalapeño slices and other add-one like tripe, but nit gonna complain too much since I'm getting a pretty tasty bowl in the heart of the village. Spring rolls were also pretty good.  Please note cash only. (Though Overheard a different server mentioning to another party at the bar seat that ordering with her needs to be paid in cash but can pay with credit cards through orders online; so ask to be sure.)"
1810,"We walked in at 6:15pm on a Friday night and there was a 20 minute wait to be seated. Not bad, considering the place is relatively small! As we left (around 7:45pm), there was a super long wait / crowd waiting outside so plan accordingly as they don't take reservations.My friend and I ordered the SS Classic Bahn Mi sandwich and Lemongrass Chicken, Shrimp and Spring Roll combo to share between the 2 of us - great portion sizes! The SS Classic Bahn Mi is probably the juiciest bahn mi I've ever had - really flavorful sauce, but definitely not what I was used to! There was also bacon in the bahn mi which I've yet to see. Super balanced, yummy, and filling. The lemongrass chicken, shrimp and spring rolls combo was also delicious. You have the choice between rice and vermicelli, and we chose the noodles! Everything was well balanced, especially with the sauce. Fresh veg and sour pickled carrots paired with the grilled chickend and crunch of the fried spring rolls made for an amazing bite.Overall, a great meal in the NYU area. If you need to wait, just head on over to WSP. Just an overall heads up - they're cash only!"
1811,"Large bowl of Saigon pho fills me right up! Quick service, large portions, and great value for all your needs. I was originally intrigued by their $5 banh mi (which is almost unheard of anywhere but especially nyc). You got the right amount of meat, herbs, and mayo at such an affordable price. It is really hard to beat if you're in the area looking for a quick but satisfying bite. But what I'm really here to talk about is their incredibly delicious and filling saigon pho with fresh brisket, beef, and meatballs. This was a game changer. First of all, the bowl is massive! You get warm, flavorful broth, a generous selection of meat, and all the Sriracha and hoisin sauce you could want since all the bottles stay on the table. Plenty of green onion too. Delicious! I'm glad I went with the recommendation to try the Saigon pho. My friend also enjoyed the sweet potato fries and the Vietnamese coffee. You will definitely see me again"
1812,It's a very popular place. I came here for weekday lunch and I had to wait about 45 minutes.We ordered the Classic Pho and Spicy Brisket Pho. It was average and nothing special. The broth wasn't flavorful. I wish it had more noodles. The Vietnamese coffee was very sweet for me. I won't order it again. Many people ordered Banh Mi or Vermicelli noodle dishes. I might try them next time.
1813,"I was really excited! Went here to try their $5 banh mi. The banh mi was mediocre, the bread was a bit stale, not impressive. The overall experience was awful. I asked the hostess/server (seemed like manager/owner) if they take card, she rudely said ""order online"" and walked away. I noticed that the price online is higher than in-person, the banh mi is $7 online. I came back with cash, waited at the counter to take my order, the same employee saw me, but did not come to take my order. So another staff, a young gentleman came and kindly took my order. So the stars are for him! I then waited for my banh mi outside, where the same employee that ignored me, knows I am waiting for my order. She brought out the customer before me her order so I assumed she'd do the same for all take outs. But that didn't happen. I made eye contact with her MULTIPLE times, but she just walked away & was busy taking other tables' checks rather than checking on take out orders. After waiting for 15 mins for 1 banh mi, I went in to check on my order, same kind staff that took my order, came over and gave me my banh mi, which was in the corner not with the other take out orders. I really appreciated this kind gentleman who helped me with my order. However, I will not be coming back or recommending this restaurant to others due this subpar experience."
1814,"Came here with my fiancé & we ordered two different types of pho - both were incredible. The noodles were prepared al dente which was the best part! I ordered the S.S. Special Spicy Pho which was very tasty, I absolutely loved it but it definitely wasn't spicy for me if you're worried about the spice level. Either way, highly recommend and would order again! My fiancé ordered the Classic Beef Pho which he loved and preferred over my spicy pho. The broth was distinctly different and had layers of flavor! We saw other tables order the apps and sandwiches which looked unreal - we'll definitely be coming back."
1815,Go to pho place! Delicious and affordable. They take cards but bring cash for a discount.
1816,"It's interesting as I had always ordered through caviar from Saigon shack until last week when I realized it was simply on MacDougal St and not too far from my office. I walk through MacDougal quite a lot so it's funny how I hadn't noticed it's location before.It was an idyllic fall day, I took a nice brisk yet sunny stroll to SS, sat outside and had myself a meal on my own. MacDougal is a great people watching spot so I felt at peace taking time for myself to have a sit down lunch. Delicious and crunchy sweet potato fries with a vegetarian pho soup left me warm and satisfied. Makes for great leftovers too! Everyone from hostess to the waitstaff was friendly and accommodating."
1817,"Super delicious Pho place in Greenwich village!Their pho broth is just the right amount of flavor, and not overwhelming or undersauced like many pho places that I have tried in the past. My favorite was the Saigon Pho, which is the classic combination of brisket, raw beef and meatball. Can't go wrong with this dish.They also have several unique a pho dishes that were really good. They have a spicy short rib pho that is so tender and fall of the bone. They also have a delicious oxtail pho that I liked as well. They are pretty busy and don't take reservations, so it may be a little bit of a wait. They also only take cash, so either come prepared or use the ATM outside of the restaurant.A bit pricey but I would definitely say that it is worth it!"
1818,"The food came out within 15 minutes which was really nice. We got the hot Vietnamese coffee, which I wasn't really a fan of as the coffee tasted a little burnt. The pho was super meaty and even had some marrow. The broth was the star of the show. The spicy brisket sandwich also really good and was even better dipped into the broth. If you're in the mood for Vietnamese and in the area, it's definitely a place worth visiting"
1819,"This is my go to spot for Vietnamese food! I have tried others, but have always found myself coming back, and here's why: 1. Food is very decently priced: $12 for a classic beef pho 2. Variety of options: Banh Mi sandwiches, Pho, spring/summer rolls, pork chops, salads, and a variety of drinks to choose from. 3. Staff is always very friendly. 4. FLAVOR, FLAVOR, FLAVOR. Try any Pho and you'll know what I'm talking about. I promise you will not be disappointed to try this place if you're looking for affordable, delicious, authentic vientamese food. Try it out!"
1820,"After eating here, I got so upset. My mind was wandering and thinking to myself damn, in NYC this is how you can fool people who think this is good pho and are willing to pay near $20 for a bowl. I ordered the Saigon Pho which was $15.50 + tax + tip. The broth was not flavorful at all and the soup was mega lackluster. I was very disappointed that I chose this place as maybe my taste buds are honed too well. I am guessing most of their business comes from NYU students and people who may not know good pho."
1821,"A group of friends went here on Sunday for a post-park meal. Despite being busy, we were seated almost immediately!I originally ordered the Vegetable Pho, but my order somehow got translated to the Vegetarian Cóm with Vermicelli noodles. Luckily, my friend changed his mind, so we traded dishes. The Vegetable Pho was incredible. It definitely satisfied my pho craving. My friend also let met try the Vegetarian Cóm with Vermicelli noodles. I only tried the plant-based meat from the dish, and it was amazing! Perfect crisp with sweet and sour flavor. He enjoyed the dish a lot!As of right now, you can place an order online or with the waiter. If you order online, there's a credit card fee, but we didn't find it a big deal. If you order online, make sure you order correctly! I just got super lucky with my friend wanting to switch, lol.Since we paid ahead of time, we felt as though they didn't check in on us as often. It was hard to get the server's attention. We didn't have many asks, though - just refills on water. Overall, it was a great experience with amazing food."
1822,"Stopped here for a quick dinner before a show at the Cellar, which is right down the block. Amazing Vietnamese food in the village for such a good price +fresh rolls and banh mi were both ONLY 8$ +fresh rolls with shrimp were delicious and came out so quick +I went with the classic banh mi, although all the options sounded so good. This sandwich was SO FLAVORFUL AND CRUNChy. Probably the best banh mi I've ever had - order it spicy for a nice kick!I ate half for dinner and the other half for lunch the next day -keep in mind this place is cash only, although you can get around this by ordering online through their website and ""checking out"" online"
1823,"I've recently been craving pho a lot and I can say this is my go-to choice every time. This spot is located in an area with lots of options and there is sometimes a line, but it is well worth the wait. Although, if you're like me, and hate waiting, they deliver on seamless.The delivery is excellent because they package the meat noodles, the jalapeños and lime, and the broth all separately in really nice containers that do not leak and keep everything fresh. I always request extra sriracha and jalapeños, but I love the spice. The lime they usually give can be kind of small sometimes so if you want a very Citrus flavor be sure to request extra lime! This spot is a favorite and with fall around the corner it'll definitely be in my top places."
1824,"I came her last night with a friend for dinner and the food was awesome!Food: S.S. Classic - This sandwich had the perfect ratio of bread to meat to veggies. The bacon, ham, and pate were delicious and the carrots & daikon were pickled nicely and added a refreshing balance. I need to come back here and have this again.Grilled Lemongrass Chicken, Shrimp, and Spring Rolls with Vermicelli - Such an awesome dish. The chicken and shrimp were cooked perfectly and the spring rolls were crispy with great filling. All together with the noodles and sauce, the dish was flavorful and worked well. Ambience: The place is small and decorated in a trendy fashion. It's also quite a popular place and a lot of people coming in and out so you literally can't stand anywhere for too long without being in someone's way. Misc: This place is CASH ONLY and doesn't accept reservations so make sure to head over there and add your name to their waitlist.Overall, would come back for both of the dishes I had and I definitely need to try more!"
1825,"4.5 / 5The pho was delicious; soup was very clean and was perfect in saltiness. Taste, I would say, is 5/5. The noodles were a bit cold for mine, and some of them were clumped together. Honestly, this happens in almost all of the pho restaurants, but I could feel the temperature difference between my cold noodles and the warm soup, which wasn't too pleasant. Really good pho though, I'd recommend!"
1826,"New favorite spot 10/10 The food was amazing, I had Grilled Pork Chops and Sweet Potato Fries. It was delicious!!!"
1827,"COVID report: Saigon Shack has indoor and outdoor seating and is doing contact tracing/temperature checks. Needed a bite before Up & Up, which is next door, and my boyfriend were able to walk in around 6:15 on a Friday and get a table inside. Spring rolls were perfect, and the lemongrass chicken over rice was super tasty. Saigon Shack remains reliable, quick, delicious and inexpensive!"
1828,"This spot has been a go-to comfort food favorite of mine for years. Any time someone asks my recommendation for a good pho spot, I always either recommend this place or its sister restaurant Pho Bar. The only reason why I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because they only have one vegetarian Pho option (although they have several vegetarian options for appetizers, and several for entrees in general). Nonetheless, the one vegetarian option is sill my favorite in the city. It comes with a generous amount of fresh and flavorful vegggies - broccoli, bok choy, carrots, potatoes, beans, etc - along with a deliciously seasoned (seitan? super firm tofu?) for the protein. I always order extra protein in mine. All of the above, plus rice noodles, are cooked perfectly in a delicious and flavorful vegetable broth. Each bowl of Pho also comes with bean sprouts, fresh jalapeno slices, lime wedges and thai basil on the side. ALl of the ingredients are fresh and flavorful. A bowl of Pho is pretty filling (and still tastes good the next day during those occasions when I sometimes bring home leftovers), but I occasionally order appetizers if I go with friends. I particularly like the vegetable spring rolls. I also recommend this place to those who are seeking a healthy place to eat, or a no-carb place. heir steamed veggies are also pretty good. Moreover, they are excellent with the covid protocols, and have a great outdoor dining setup that is actually OUTDOORS (not in a makeshift shed). As the weather gets better, more people get vaccinated, and things start going back to normal, expect to wait 30 minutes or more for a seat during the dinner rush. That said, this place is well worth the wait."
1829,"Saigon shack is one of my to-go's anytime I go to New York. They have fried catfish that is super delicious. I don't generally get pho, but my family loves their pho. I always go for their banh mi or vermicelli. Just remember to bring cash before heading over, or they have an ATM right next to it."
1830,Saigon shack is very high quality Vietnamese food given the price point. The dining experience itself is definitely more casual and can feel chaotic with Uber eats delivery people filtering in and out of the small restaurant and the busy street outside. My order for pick up said it would be ready at 6:40 pm I was disappointed to have to have waited until 7:10 which is the main reason I gave 3 stars. The food was very good for the most part- highly recommend the pork fresh spring rolls and chicken pho. I recommend against the brisket sandwich since the meat was very fatty and a bit off putting.
1831,"A friend and I stopped by here to have lunch on an April Saturday afternoon. The weather was great and they had seatings both indoor and outdoor. The wait was about 20 minutes or so. We ended up going inside which was great. They are covid friendly. The tables were 6 feet apart and they checked your temperature as well as have lots of sanitizer available. They also asked you to sign a check in sheet where you'll need to put your Name and contact information in case of an emergency.When we visited they only accepted cash only, but you could order online and pay with your debit or credit card. So you have options.I have heard such good reviews about this place and always wanted to try Vietnamese food. So here I am!!!Their menu is pretty organized where they have sections for sandwiches, noodles, rice and so on...I'd ended up getting a bowl of white rice, vegetables, grilled shrimps and vegetable spring rolls. Oh my the food was so much yet it was filling and tasty. And most importantly all this was $13 or less. They serve large portion of really good food at an affordable price which is a plus. I definitely would like to visit again and try their fish sandwich; I see a lot of folks having that.And I had to wash my food down with a iced Vietnamese coconut coffee. It was my first time trying this and it was super delicious! Highly recommend visiting if you are in the village."
1832,"I've been going to Saigon Shack for over 4 years and have had a great experience every time... until today. I ordered their beef sautéed beef flank for take out. Halfway through my meal I found a long piece of plastic wrap at the bottom of my bowl. I didn't even notice it until I bit into something that had a strange texture. I pulled it out from the bottom and realized it was super long, so I assume it was most likely used to cover up a container of ingredients. How does something like that go unnoticed? What makes matters even worse is that they denied me a refund even after sending them the photo. I will not be coming back again."
1833,"Good Vietnamese comfort food! One bowl and pho and your cravings are satisfied! Location: It is located in Noho. There is indoor and outdoor seating! Very compliant with covid precautions. The indoor is typical Vietnamese restaurant! Bathroom is only one, so you have to fall in line.Service: the servers are very nice! Very knowledgeable in what's on the menu. Very friendly as well. They don't rush you to leave the restaurant.Food: Hit and miss at their menu! FRIED CRAB CAKE: it was okay, tasty and soft. But probably will try other appetizers. GRILLED PORK CHOPS PHO: omg it is soo good! A little bit salty but the broth together with the pork chops is so delicious! Good amount of pork in there too! VEGETARIAN PHO: it was good as well, the broth is beef tho but there is a lot of veggies inside! THAI ICED TEA: it was okay, there is a lot more better thai iced tea than this.Price rating: 6/10, not bad for the deliciousness! Typical price for a pho.Definitely will come back here if I am craving for pho! Will try their other flavor of pho!"
1834,was craving some pho during a cold winter day and this place was one of the highest reviews in the area.  it was pretty crowded but they sat me right away.  i got my pho and it was good.  the broth was clean and flavorful.  there wasnt any oils floating at the top.  the meat was tender and not overly cooked.  the noodles was good too.  i got a banh mi to go and that was just okay.  i toasted it when i ate it so the bread was nice and crunchy but the flavor of the meats and veggies was just okay.  this place is definitely more modern than the traditional vietnamese restaurants.  thats probably the reason for the slightly higher prices.
1835,"Came here for dinner after a few friends from NY recommended it to me for my first time visiting NY. - Covid safety: 1/5 restaurant was over crowded. Only 1 table got the clear shield.- service: 0/5 the person that took my name down for the waiting list kept spelling my name wrong. He kept writing NONO so I spelled it slowly again and said ""it's N-G-O-C it's a Vietnamese name"" and he said ""yea, it's a weird name"". That was super rude and disrespectful to me. Why are you working at a Vietnamese restaurant if you're gonna diss a Vietnamese name and person? I truly wanted to support a Vietnamese business but this place was a 0 for me. I ended up going to ""Hello Saigon"" just a few minute down & that place was a much better experience. Spacious, Covid safety was on point (they got outside sitting too), food was good, and most importantly-- they treated me with respect from the moment I walked in until I walked out. Sorry Saigon Shack but you gotta train your employees better and follow Covid protocols."
1836,"Ordered in from Saigon Shack last night. Got the vegetarian pho and it definitely beat my expectations. Usually I am skeptical of ordering pho since I enjoy the experience of dining in and eating it on the spot. It had the freshness, warmth and all of the ingredients in my delivery order for me to be able to put it together myself and enjoy it from the comfort of my home. I will definitely be ordering from here again."
1837,"I came in here on a Wednesday evening, and it was pretty busy; however, I was able to get a table for my party without any wait. The staff is super friendly, although I found the food to be pretty mid. I think it is overpriced for the portion they provide. I ordered the pork chop, shrimp, and spring roll combo with white rice, and the portion was on the smaller end for $16.95. If you are in Greenwich Village and are extremely stuck on only eating Vietnamese food, come here. However, there are plenty hole in the wall Vietnamese locations with more authentic food at a fairer price point scattered across Manhattan."
1838,"cash or scan the barcode and pay upfront, simple Vietnamese food that really hits the spot. Bear lots of things so a great spot before a comedy show or nearby desert"
1839,"By far one of the best Vietnamese places ever. It's situated right on MacDougal so it's near tons of eateries but there's almost always a line to get in despite the options. Their pho is ginormous and comes with all the works. I've tried their beef pho (which is their best seller and my favorite) and their tofu one (it tasted disgusting but that's because I'm not a tofu fan). Definitely recommend this place, especially during a cold winter night when you need a little extra comfort food."
1840,"The staff at this restaurant were really nice. A waitress even told me that I could get the same dish for cheaper if I chose another option! The food was pretty good but nothing extraordinary, hence the 4 stars rating. Expect to spend around $20 per person, if you get an appetizer. I went there with my friend. We shared the spring roll for appetizer. I got sautéed shrimp and she got the pho. We spent $45 (tip included)5 stars- amazing staff, ambiance, food worth the price. 4 stars- good staff, ambiance, food could be better, no extraordinary flavor compared to price. 3 stars- okay service and food. 2 stars- either bad food or bad service 1 star- everything awful"
1841,"A convenient place right by NYU! Make sure to come with a small group or plan to wait a bit for seating because the place was popping on a Friday night at dinner. Food: The classic Pho was delicious, with plenty of meat and noodles. The broth was flavorful and not too salty. I loved the summer rolls (appetizers)--massive rolls, and the peanut sauce was delicious. One thing is that I don't recommend the Thai Iced Tea--for $5, it was slightly too expensive and not enough condensed milk. Service: really efficient. Order and pay with credit card on their mobile app. Needs an account with ChowNow but it's a decent app.Overall would recommend if you can dig the crowdedness of the student scene."
1842,The classic banh mi was really tasty but do not get it spicy unless you can handle extreme levels of heat!!! I am usually pretty good about spicy things but this spice was intense. It was still good though... and only $5!!!!
1843,"Have ordered from this place a number of times now, never had a problem until today. I've always requested that my pho not include cilantro, but for whatever reason today the chef seemed offended enough to ignore my request but also go the extra mile of throwing *copious* amounts of cilantro in.There was a top layer of cilantro that I managed to pick off but once that was cleared off there was yet *another* layer of cilantro underneath the slices of brisket and flank! Honestly at that point this felt.. malicious.Got a $10 credit from the vendor I had ordered through, but I decided to call the restaurant directly to let them know about my issue directly anyway.  Politely, if I might add.Whomever the woman was that picked up the phone definitely needs some training in customer service or just not be involved on the customer service side of the business at all -- ""Yeah, okay, hold on."" *click*She hung up on me.I really hate to say this, but I will never order from this place again and I will no longer recommend them to my friends. It's a shame too, since the pho is pretty decent here."
1844,"I've been here a few times and it can be pretty hit or miss. Some days the pho broth can be very flavorful and good, other times like water. Also the chicken banh mi sucks. The chicken is dry and tough, veggies are not pickled well (where the radish at?!), and they put way too many carrots in the sandwich. Bread is also meh. Just lazy execution. I would pass on the banh mi here."
1845,"First I've gotta say, I've been coming here for my pho fix since 2014 and never really had a bad experience until recently. But this experience really left a bad taste in my mouth. First thing when we walk in a man comes up to us to ask how many in our party (2 people) and then goes outside to presumably check if anyone was ahead of us on the list (there was no one outside). When he decides to seat us he motions towards a small table by the door. We ask if we can sit on the bench seating bc there was no one around and bc I don't like sitting right in front of the door, and he told us it was for large parties only.I have no problem with this policy, makes sense, but when I started having an issue is when within a minute or two he sat another couple there. So he lied. Next, when we got our food, my brisket pho was just all like crumbs of meat? I'd gotten this dish before and expected generous slices but got this instead. It felt like I was eating pho with ground beef.All in all a very mediocre experience. I've been coming here for pho for the past 7-ish years and honestly the food and service has been trending downwards."
1846,"I ordered vegetarian pho and was originally given meat broth which they realized when they put the bowl on the table which they promptly removed. They then came back my ""vegetarian"" pho which contained several pieces of chicken. I ordered the vegetarian p"
1847,"My absolute favorite place for banh mis in the whole city (I was so sad when they were closed during the early months of the pandemic, but so glad to see them back). The price can't be beat -- the classic version is only $5! And you also get a choice of if you want it spicy or not. I've tried their pho a couple times, it's great for a cold NYC night, but not my favorite. They have tables set up for outdoor dining during the pandemic and QR code scanners for the menu. Cash only!"
1848,"This place is amazing but like other reviewers have mentioned, expect a wait at most times! I've tried the pho, sandwich, and spring/summer rolls which are all delicious. They have plenty of options for vegetarians too which is awesome. The only thing that would make this place better is if they have lunch specials! If the wait is too long or you're in a rush I would definitely recommend ordering ahead and picking up your food, which is always packaged well and tastes so fresh. It is cash only but now they let you order via a QR code that is at every table so you can order online and pay with a credit card, then they'll bring your order to your table. Their Vietnamese iced coffee is delicious but extremely strong (as is their regular coffee)! This place is a fan favorite for a reason and is definitely worth checking out if you're in the area (or if you're not)!"
1849,One of the best value and tastiest pho spots I've been to in NYC! Order and pay in cash and you get a small discount.
1850,We finally made it to try the ice cream nuggets tik tok was raving about !! So worth it. Was a nice dessert after our dinner. The honey sauce had a little spicy kick to it so it meshed so well with the ice cream! We loved it so much that we got a Order toGo! The nuggets will be available until 11/4 so definitely check them out !!!
1851,"Found this cute gem in the city near little Italy. The place felt like a blast from the past with Rugrats themed ice cream, images and music playing. The staff was really friendly and the line went super fast. I ordered a vanilla and chocolate chip cup and hot fudge drizzle. YUM!"
1852,Love this place! This is my go-to place to get my ice cream fix. The quality of ice cream and mix in's are amazing. All the special combo flavors are spot on and I can't wait to go back to try a milkshake. They have a couple indoor tables but also have an outdoor space to sit and chill at as well.
1853,"I tried The Cookie Crisp carnival, it was amazing!There were so many more options I wanted to try. Will be back!"
1854,"I've been to Milk & Cream Cereal Bar on two separate occasions and both had promotions attached to them. I love their different events and collaborations where they hand out freebies. I went to the National Cereal Day where I got a free cereal treat pop and a $1 Ice Cream Swirl collaboration with Ogx! I really thought this place was overhyped and overrated, but their ice cream is actually worth all the commotion. The ice cream is thick and creamy. It is very good quality for the price you pay. Definitely isn't something you can have every day, but it's such a nice treat!Their collaborations are very clever and creative. It really is friendly to all ages and their ice cream is very good! I highly recommend and will be back for more!"
1855,Just missed their Rugrats promotion. All in all the shop has standard ice cream flavors and toppings. Its in a great location by many interesting shops nearby. The wait was a little long at around 9pm.
1856,"This place is so good. It's not cheap, but it's worth it. Anything with chocolate is the best in my opinion!"
1857,"Personally I don't understand the cereal bar concept or cultural phenomenon, but my husband has been really wanting to go to a cereal bar. Surprised him with a trip to this place to try it out. The place was really clean, the staff friendly, and they have a nice area outside to sit and eat your instagramable ice cream. We ordered a cookie dough ice cream with Cinnamon Toast Crunch, chocolate sprinkles, and honey. It was solid ice cream, but again the cereal thing is beyond my comprehension."
1858,"It's hyped up, and for good reason.You don't have to be a cereal lover to love this place. If you think every other ice cream place tastes the same you're highly mistaken. The ice cream is creamy but doesn't melt too quick.We ordered a cookie shake with Reese's and an applejacks ice cream with strawberry drizzle.TO. DIE. FOR.Just go, try it! Next time I visit def trying the hot ones honey sauce drizzle"
1859,"Found this cute gem in the city near little Italy. The place felt like a blast from the past with Rugrats-themed ice cream, images, and music playing. The staff was really friendly and the line went super fast. I ordered a vanilla and chocolate chip cup and hot fudge drizzle. YUM!"
1860,Wanted to love this place but unfortunately it fell flat.  The concept is great but the ice cream is simply nothing to write home about.  An ice cream swirl in a cup of cone is $7 but apparently it's a bigger serving in a cup so I would opt for that.  That definitely did check out as the Cookie Crisp Carnival in a cup was so huge that I couldn't even finish it among two people (nor did we really want to either).  This is one of those places where unfortunately quantity is prioritized over quality as the ice cream was just mediocre.  I get that it's soft swerve but it shouldn't have been mushy to begin with and there was simply nothing special about it.  I get the price but I don't get the hype.
1861,"Due to the pandemic there is a little outdoor seating to eat your dessert which I'm very thankful for since it was freezing. I ordered l: 1. Pineapple under the sea swirl - if you like soft serve with sprinkles and pineapple, get this! 2. Cookie Crisp carnival- if you like chocolate cereal get this"
1862,"This spot has great ice cream but be prepared to share your ice cream. It is a large portion and can be quite heavy after a while. I really enjoyed the Apple Jack Avalanche (Apple Jacks, honey bunches of oats, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch blended with ice cream)"
1863,"It was freaking 4 degree Celsius but ice cream is ice cream and everyone seem to want it no matter the weather. There was actually a line when we got there after lunch in China Town on a Sunday afternoon. There's no indoor dining, but they have some standing spaces with heater. It seems that they are doing a collab with Nickelodion or something because they have some Spongebob menu specials like Krabby Patty ice cream sliders. I went for the usual create your own Ice Cream with Cinnamon Toast Crunch topped with banana, and I love it!It's pretty huge but it's easily gone since I highly enjoyed if. It's not too heavy, not overwhelmingly milky, and sweet but not nauseating. Looks pretty picturesque too! Had a bite of the cookie crisp carnival (one of their specials) and it was really good as well!"
1864,"This dessert place is super cute with plenty of unique cereal flavors. I like how they make all the toppings very aesthetic, like the teddy bear graham crackers. I'm not the biggest fan of the cereal flavors overall since it's a bit too sweet for me, but I would definitely recommend that someone tries this place out (especially if you like cereal!). I think it's an interesting concept to have ice cream blended with cereal.During the pandemic, there is seating outside but it's fairly limited. There are still quite a few people who come after dinner, but I'm guessing it's more free at other times of the day."
1865,"So I've been wanting to come here after seeing many posts on Instagram with krabby patties and other fun Spongebob themed ice cream. So of course, on the last day of the theme, I decided to head into the city for a nice treat. My daughter loves Spongebob so I knew she would enjoy it as well. Initially, I was nervous about eating ice cream during the winter, but they have an outdoor area that's covered and heated,which was a perfect spot to try out our desserts. My daughter got the krabby patty, which is an ice cream sandwich with cake, chocolate covered ice cream, jello and fondant. All the pieces go together to create the iconic krabby patty as seen on the show ""Spongebob"". She really enjoyed it and took apart each layer of the burger to taste each part individually.Her favorite part was the ""patty"" portion of the burger', which was the chocolate covered ice cream. I kept it pretty basic and got the vanilla ice cream with brownie bite mix-ins. The vanilla ice cream was nice and creamy. The brownie bites added a nice texture contrast as well as a chocolatey element. For the amount of ice cream, there could have been more brownie bites however it was still very good as is. The staff gave us two free milk shakes. One with fruity pebbles and another cookie crisps. My daughter tried out the fruity pebble milkshake and she loved it. The second milkshake is in our freezer waiting for us to try it out. I definitely plan on coming  back to Milk & Cream Cereal Bar. I can't wait to try more of their combos and creations."
1866,"I tried the Blue Clues milk shake and also the ice cream sandwich.  I got the Ube milkshake and that was so so so good!  This I give a 5.  You could taste the ube in it and I was so surprised because these things are usually very gimmicky and don't taste like the actual thing.  I would definitely get this again.  I got the ube ice cream sandwich and that was unfortunately, not good.  The cookie part was so hard and it wasn't soft at all.  I'm glad I didn't break my teeth or jaw from taking a bite.  I guess I could've let it thaw a bit first, but it was really really rock hard.  It was harder than your average take-out-from-your-own-freezer hard.  The ube ice cream itself was also really hard.  I couldn't taste the ube as much when compared to the milkshake.  I wouldn't get this again.  I also ordered a box of the Vita inspired mooncakes.  I am a huge sucker for things like this so I knew I had to try it.  The box itself was pretty pricey for what you were getting, but I didn't mind because it was for a good cause.  The mooncakes were just okay.  You couldn't really taste the flavors.  They all kind of tasted the same to be honest.  If they were to re-do this, I think they should make the mooncakes bigger and revamp their recipe to make them more tasty.  I would also lower the price.Overall, a cute mom and pop ice cream spot.  I will be back to try their other milkshakes since that was really good and also their soft serve.  Don't think I will be getting another ice cream sandwich though."
1867,Good ice cream. They have a lot of cereal combinations available. I got the vanilla icecream with french toast crunch cereal and brownie bites topping and chocolate and honey drizzle. Very good.
1868,"Ice cream blended with any cereal of your choice is the premise of a business pulled straight out of a sugar fiend's wildest dreams, and here it is come to life. They've really blown up after many media appearances as well as partnerships with Spot Dessert Bar, with influencers like @foodbabyny, and even with Nickelodeon. Their marketing tactics are slick but they actually have a quality product to show for it. My sweet tooth has brought me here on a number of occasions over the years and I've tried everything from their chocolate s'mores galore to their milkshakes.I think what really worked for Milk & Cream is that they were one of the earlier purveyors of dessert made for the Instagram age. Each ice cream swirl is made picture perfectly, replete with cute toppings like teddy grahams and caramel drizzles. There's a bright neon sign up front that people love to take photos in front of. Unlike many other social media dessert playgrounds that lack any substance, the ice cream at Milk & Cream is quite tasty, and you have a long list of choices when it comes to what cereal you want blended into it. Most of the classics are on the menu, and the machine they have to blend the ingredients together does a great job of distributing just the right amount of cereal throughout the ice cream, so each bite is equally satisfying.With every subsequent visit I am finding the ice cream here more and more overly sweet, and it doesn't help that every single cereal choice they have is a very sweet one, almost without exception. It would be nice to have more neutral options like Crispx, plain Cheerios, or even Kix, since the ice cream itself is already very sweet. I realize though they're not catering to palates like mine, as much as I crave sweets, but to people who would gladly make ""there's no such thing as too sweet"" the mantra of their life. If this is you, this is your place."
1869,Super cool ice cream bar where you can mix your childhood cereals. Be prepared to wait online but it moves pretty quickly.
1870,"I love this place! Such a cool concept. They have two ice cream flavors, vanilla and cookies and cream and you are allowed to mix in any cereal into the ice cream.They have a new teenage mutant ninja turtles pizza shaped ice cream which is for a limited time only, so the line was was super long (maybe 20 people), but totally worth it.The limited addition ice cream was delicious and I can't wait to go back and get it again before its gone. The people that work there are super nice and friendly and very helpful.IG-@traveleen_gurl"
1871,Great treat bar! Lots of options for toppings! And they signature mixes make it easy. I could barely choose! I went with the cookie dough carnival signature mix and it was delicious. Good vibes and very quick service. Enjoyed the rugrats theme. Great place to bring a friend and sit outside for a chat.
1872,"When I saw this place on Yelp, I knew I had to try it. I tasted the first bite and instantly was sent to heaven. I am not a huge dessert person but this took it to another level. I couldn't get enough of it. The ice cream/cereal fusion is something everyone needs to experience. This is the best dessert I've ever had."
1873,"I've never been a cereal and milk kind of girl - it's never done it for me...but I do love ice cream. Who doesn't?!! Nonetheless, Milk & Cream's ice cream blows it out of the park! This is my second time coming and it was just as good as I remembered. This time, I ordered a swirl with honey bunches of oats, toasted coconut flakes, and a honey drizzle and a pint of cookie dough ice cream with coco puffs and captain crunch to take home. The total came out to $20 and my belly was happy!"
1874,Great bunch of guys working behind the counter.  Honored a military discount which was generous of them as not many New York establishments offer or recognize that.  Thank you Milk & Cream Cereal Bar for supporting the military community.
1875,"I really enjoy coming here every now and then. They have a really great set up currently, you go to the front and just order your ice cream. They have various cereal options and toppings. I ended up getting the lucky charms ice cream blended with vanilla ice cream and topped it off with rainbow sprinkles . The ice cream was fantastic!"
1876,"I got their vanilla soft serve with Fruity Pebbles, with Chocolate Drizzle & Brownie Pieces as a topping and it was definitely yummy! If I wasn't the messiest ice cream eater and had to walk back to Seward Park with this ice cream, I would have gotten in a cone, but I picked the less messy cup. It was super yummy! For some odd reason, my brain didn't process that the cereal I'd pick would be IN the ice cream I'd pick, but it made complete sense once I ate said ice cream. I do kind of wish they had a third base of ""chocolate"" because I'm a chocolate ice cream dork. When I went they were doing the Rugrats promotion/occasion, and it did look really good. I wish I had the stomach space to try one of those specials. It's really cool that they develop all of these new flavors (like the Rugrats ones) in-house. The folks working there were very friendly and I will definitely have to come back when I'm in the area next!"
1877,"Such a unique and adorable ice cream shop to spice up your usual ice cream order. There are endless combinations you can choose from to form your perfect  cup or cone. With the standard cup/cone, you get the choice of either vanilla or cookie dough ice cream, mixed with your choice of cereal (one of your favorites is bound to be in the list), 1 topping, and 1 sauce. You can also choose one of their signature creations which all looked delicious as well. Cereal and ice cream is a match made in heaven so you will definitely not be disappointed!"
1878,"It's awesome how they've made changes for not only covid but also the winter weather. There is an outdoor section fully covered that protects customers while waiting. There are social distancing protocols in place when you order and where you wait. Now for the exciting part- the ice cream! It is as delicious as it looks and there are SO many choices. Once you've crafted your favorite treat, you'll wait outside and your number will be called."
1879,"During COVID: I've had Milk & cream on my radar for months now and finally had a chance to stop by. They are open during quarantine. I ordered a vanilla based cone with Cookie Crisp and Reese's puffs with crushed M&M topping (3.5/5). Was it good? Yes. But it wasn't memorable enough for me to crave it again. I also didn't realize that they actually blend the cereal into the ice cream. I do typically like cereal as a topping.My partner got the frooty special cone, which I must admit I was not a fan. Its taste was too much like artificial grape and it's a big minus when I see gummies as a topping on ice cream due to it becoming very hard and unpleasant to eat.I personally like the ice cream at Soft Swerve much more as I love taro ice cream. That being said, if you are looking for an instagramable cereal soft serve fix, this will definitely hit it."
1880,"i'm visiting new york and came across this ice cream place. it was AMAZING ! they blend the cereal of your choice into the ice cream. then we got to pick one topping and a drizzle ! the ice cream was soft and creamy, and the fruity pebbles blended inside added more flavor and texture. i got brownie bite toppings and chocolate drizzle, which added a nice chocolate flavor."
1881,Can they please open one of these in LA?! This place was SO good. I got cookie crisps with cookie dough ice cream and a chocolate graham cracker topping. It was worth the long walk from east village and still delicious in the cold!! Will be back again soon hopefully!
1882,"One of my favorite cereal icecream places. I'm a huge cereal and icecream/froyo fan so I've tried all the ones in the area, including the famous milk bar cereal soft serve. None compare.For starters they have every single cereal you could ever want to make a custom sundae. They grind whatever you choose into the soft serve which truly encompasses the flavor throughout. Then if that wasn't already good enough- you get to add more cereal to the top! (And whatever other toppings you choose)I have also had the pre created sundae combos which are also equally delicious. Ends up costing around $8 but is a large portion (have shared with my sister). I have/ will continue to go back."
1883,"Ice cream + cereal? YES GAWD! We ordered the cookie dough ice cream with Cookie Crisp cereal blended in a red velvet cone for our first visit. It was so amazing we had to go back and get it again in a cup. Look at that beauty...boy, the staff really know how to work those cereal-blender-soft-serve-ice-cream-machine-things behind the counter. Check them out if you're ever in NYC!"
1884,"Milk & Cream Cereal Bar offers a wide variety of cereal infused vanilla ice creams. Due to COVID, their indoor seating is closed but there is a spacious and clean outdoor seating booths for customers to use. There are stickers on the sidewalk to promote social distancing within the line. All staff members were wearing masks.The menu offers lots of opportunities to customize your flavors and toppings. All ice creams have a vanilla base as you choose which cereal you'd like to infuse. You also get a choice of one topping and drizzle (extra toppings will be charged). The sweetness of the ice cream definitely depend on your cereal base/toppings/drizzle. My absolute favorite combo is the fruity pebble cereal blend, cookie dough and honey. For my mom who's not as much of a sweet tooth as I am, she ordered the honey bunches of oats blend, peanuts and honey.  I definitely recommend these two ice cream blends depending on your sweetness cravings.Overall I love the cereal blend options that Milk & Cream Cereal Bar has to offer. There's something so delicious about the simplicity of the ice cream that you just can't dislike. I can't wait to try out their other cereal blend flavors! Definitely one of my favorite ice cream spots in NYC!"
1885,"Though I'd preferred more natural flavors, I have to applaud this place to come up with the idea of blending ice cream and cereal. We went with vanilla and honey nut Cheerios. Pretty good combo - final result is thick and has chunks of Cheerios to enjoy. The chocolate teddy grahams are very cute."
1886,I been wanting to try out this place for the longest time and I finally did yesterday and I am very impressed with the ice cream here. The ice cream is very soft and creamy- great quality. I added cookie dough and it was amazing. It's also not overwhelmingly sweet. Great customer service too. No line no wait during my afternoon visit.
1887,Covid Friendly - childhood dreams in a ice-cream. Shareable portion sizes. Just a short walk from prince street pizza - dessert time is the best time
1888,"I love the ice cream and the cones here but when the napkin starts sticking to the cone and making it completely inedible that's where I have to call it quits. After dealing with this one too many times, I stopped coming here. I hope they develop a solution to this issue"
1889,"Omg! If you are craving ice cream this is the pace to go, they have the best selection of toppings with the best staff. You can be fully creative and eat the best ice cream in the world."
1890,"Such a unique pizza experience. I first saw the artichoke pizza on an Instagram ad and had to bookmark it for when I was in NYC next. This slice is 100% different than your typical Joes slice but it's definitely worth trying. The artichoke slice is huge and incredibly rich- so I usually share it with someone. But it's hot, creamy and always has a crispy crust. Always. I now go every time I'm in nyc. My routine is getting Mamoun's Falafel and then topping off the meal sharing a slice of artichoke pizza."
1891,"Makes me sad to say this.I had this 15  yrs ago when I first came to NYC and thought it was the best but now I can honestly say it's not good pizza :( The artichoke is my least favorite white pizza I've had - super thick layer, taste like leftover Alfredo pasta on a pizza Even tried the margarita and it sucked - no flavor Also NY pizza should bend... this thing could plank on top of the Empire State Building for hours :( sorry artichoke I wanted to like you the same as I did as a 15 year old"
1892,"The size of this slice was huge!The slice has a creamy Alfredo sauce base with spinach and artichoke bits. It was so cheesy and will leave you with a food coma for sure.I recommend sharing one slice if you're planning to eat more food while you're in the city. I ate a slice of pizza before coming here, so I was a bit full and struggled to finish it all!"
1893,"Although not traditional pizza, this was definitely one of the best pizza we had in New York! Slices were super big and cheesy and super filling. One slice was definitely enough for just us two. It was definitely the most unique pizza we tried in New York and I can't stop thinking about getting it again!The artichoke pizza tastes literally like someone slapped artichoke dip on a piece of bread. It's so good!The servers were also super friendly and welcoming here, would definitely want to come again!"
1894,"I LOVE artichoke pizza so much that I had my best friend bring me a slice when she came to visit from NYC!! I recently went back to visit NY with a friend and took him to experience the art of pizza that's made here! I almost got a heart attack when we walked by and it was closed not realizing that they expanded and moved across the street! No matter which slice you get, you won't regret it, all of their combinations are delicious!"
1895,"Sooo I'm from California, San Diego to be exact, and I guess I never had real pizza. But good lord!  I ordered 4 slices that came up to like 22$ and they were all sooooooooooo good. They were like the size of 3 slices back home. I absolutely love pizza and was not disappointed in the food or the service. Thank you for the yummy in my tummy. I will be back and I will be back to Artichokes for more pizza.."
1896,"Great pizza for the price you pay! (It's around $11 for two giant slices that will fill you up) I got the Margherita and a Meat Based slice; both were delicious and fresh with a nice thin crust at the end. There wasn't really anywhere to sit, but they had counters around the walls you can eat at. Solid place to grab a quick and filling pizza!"
1897,"I finally had The Crab Slice last night, and it was worth the wait. My 1st time ever having crab on pizza. It was one of the most uniquely delicious slices of pizza I've had. The Vodka Sicilian slice was very nice too. I know people come here for the Artichoke Pizza, but it would be unwise to sleep on the the Crab Slice."
1898,"This pizza spot will stand the test of time in my book. I had my first experience in 2014 and never looked back. They have never failed to serve such delicious, hot pizza no matter the time of day. I've never been dissatisfied and will continue to support!"
1899,"While at first it seems to be an inviting radiant pizza place, the moment you go in you start to realize the owners are professional con artists.I paid $30 for my meat lovers pizza and waited over 30 minutes before asking where my pizza was. I was standing right by the register so there was no way they could miss me. After asking twice and getting told ""5 minutes"" the third time I asked over 20 minutes later was met with silence. At this point I wanted to leave but my friend backed me up and was cursed out. This is clearly not a man of values to speak to a beautiful woman in this manner. I eventually began using my fighting words and got my money back.Overall amazing pizza but I am probably banished from this establishment."
1900,"When we landed in New York, we had our eyes set on pizza. There are a variety of locations, but this one was it. Located in Astor place along with other late night munchies (halal guys and joe's pizza) I knew this was the place. The pizza was super cheesy and greasy ( just how I like it!) it gets messy and I became too full to finish. Now after eating this, I can try other pizza spots."
1901,"CASH ONLY, come prepared! Credit card minimum at $15.$3 dollar pizza quality $5 dollar size, Artichoke is now a staple of many a late night out in NYC. This location had a lot more 'specials' like Staten Island / other obscurely named pizza which were all $6! This time around we had a slice of pepperoni and a slice of Staten Island (cooked tomato sauce, red onions, sausage); the SI tasted healthier and a bit on the drier side, the pepperoni is still my favourite with the curled up meat discs and every bite as greasy as a post-game nosh should be."
1902,Delicious pizza for the late night cravings.Obviously you can go to any corner and find pizza by the slice. It's New York! This place we stumbled on because unfortunately the area we were in food places closed early. So we ended up here and we loved it. Three girls 6 slices of pizza and we chowed down! The artichoke was my favorite! It was creamy. It had the right amount of everything! So if your in the area definitely stop here for the pizza by the slice. The price is a few dollars more buuuuut the slices are waaaaaay bigger Han your traditional slices at another spot!
1903,"Great go-to artichoke pizza to be eaten immediately at one of the outdoor tables on a not-busy night. A slice can be split in half for two as a strong side as they are pretty heavy. I had the Sicilian months ago at their Park Slope location and remember it being delicious as well. Not sure why they're doing crab and pepperoni, wish they'd offer more vegan and vegetarian options cuz look at the planet. We only have 7 years to get climate change under control, y'all, or we're doomed."
1904,"Pros: the marinara slices are the largest, sauciest slices in the city.  The vodka sauce variation is also tasty albeit a bit on the rich side.Cons: the line can be a little slow depending on who's working.  The artichoke slices the tourists get are gross in my opinion."
1905,"Good pizza. Was a good deal for the whole pie. The cheese and artichoke were great, the crust was just a little too hard and thick. But other than that, solid pizza"
1906,"I used to frequent this location a lot, but I won't be any longer. It seems that the staff is inebriated by the early evening, often seeming pretty sloppy as the night goes on. They make jokes at customers' expenses, often all disappear into the back at the same time, and generally just aren't very good at their jobs. The last time I came to this location, the man behind the counter burnt the slice I had ordered until it was black and charred and asked me if that was okay (it wasn't). I also witnessed one of the workers being overtly racist to an Asian-American delivery worker who was picking up an order. I will not be giving this location any business in the future."
1907,"The artichoke pizza from Artichoke Bastille's is just about as rich and greasy as pizzas get. There actually wasn't much artichoke on the slice -- or maybe it was just overpowered by the thick cream sauce. Ideal for getting your drunchie fix in, but I wouldn't stop by here for a ""real"" meal."
1908,TLDR: if you haven't had artichoke pizza it's definitely worth a try!This location was mostly pick up. There was limited covered seating outside but there so few chairs. Grabbed a slice of artichoke and sat at Washington square park. Artichoke pizza was a lot better than I thought it would be! It was creamy and cheesy and the crust was crisp and soft. I would definitely have it again. Everything great about artichoke spinach dip and pizza in one dish.Service was okay. Guys weren't too friendly but they did their job!
1909,"Really disappointed. Expected better from NY artichoke pizza. Went there at midnight this Friday, there was a huge line, seating arrangements disorganized, pizza crust thick and burnt.Another visit, little less crowded. Had the artichoke pizza again. The crust was not burnt but still thick enough. But really like the artichoke spread so settling for a 3star rating instead of the previous 2Next visit, tried the vodka slice, quite thick, tastes more like marinara"
1910,"I travel between New York, Philadelphia and Florida weekly and PIZZA is one of my favorites... I am a South Philly guy, so it's hard to say, but NY PIZZA is the BEST!!! Artichoke did not disappoint, they came for the crown... have you put them in my Top Ten of if BEST pizzerias... dough (no flop and crisp), sauce packed with flavor and service was all 10 madones out of 5 madones"
1911,"Great, hearty slices and open late. Only issue is there's this stupid painting of the Kennedy's on the wall where all of them have WAY too many teeth in their top rows, gave me very bad vibes and honestly ruined the night. See attached"
1912,"Came here for a quick slice of their delicious artichoke pizza. I had experienced their other place near Washington Square Park and was addicted to it and when I walked by here, I jumped at the chance to get another one. No indoor dining, but there were plenty of tables outside. Service was fast, nothing noteworthy here. But the pizza. The ZA. YASSSSS. The first bite into the creamy goodness wiped away all the stress and anxiety I'm having about life and the world, just for a second while I slip into euphoria of the crunchy exterior, and soft doughy delight. The cheese was stretchy and spilled all over the place. I felt like Michelangelo (the orange one) from the ninja turtles. No wonder they lived in the sewers, they get to eat New York Pizza everyday.Anyways, I digress. Wish my order came with some napkins, I made a huge mess all over myself and the table. From the Food. Not because of the food. Get your heads out of the gutter!"
1913,Delicious! Came here as part of a food tour. A must try! The slices are huge - we got 1/2 a slice and it was big.
1914,"Tried the artichoke pizza, which can be delivered to the UES. It's not bad, but every bite tasted more like a bite of artichoke dip than pizza. It's a lot. I've tried it once and I don't think I ever need to try it again."
1915,Super fire pizza! I live in queens but when ever I'm in the area I make sure to stop buy and treat myself to some of their signature artichoke pizza.. I never imagined to have artichoke on pizza but it's slammmn!!
1916,"It's been a minute since I've had pizza especially in NYC, so I found myself here with a few friends around 4:30pm. This is technically the OG location  but they were actually located right across the street initially.A friend and I decided to split 2 slices: their infamous Artichoke slice (~$6) and the Crab slice (~$6). The worker even cut them in half for us already which was nice.The Artichoke slice is thick and rich (which is what we all aspire to be, am I right lol?). It is loaded with Artichoke Hearts, Spinach, Cream Sauce, Mozzarella, and Pecorino Romano Cheese. The cream sauce is delicious! It is a tad bit salty for me but it wasn't too overpowering. The Crab slice is a lot thinner and lighter. It is made with Crab Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella With a Surimi Stuffing. I actually really enjoyed the flavors of this slice. I would have never guessed to put any kind of seafood on a pizza, but this works!I had one full slice (technically) and this was enough to fill me up! Trust me. I was surprised. If you're super hungry, you could probably do 2 slices. Their slices are bigger than your average NYC pizza spot and pricier, of course. All in all, it's been years since I've had Artichoke, so I'm glad I stopped by!"
1917,Amaazing artichoke pizza! The crunchy crust paired up with the ooey gooey artichoke and cheese topping goes perfectly together. I love the flavor combo- so decadent and rich! Highly recommend
1918,"I discovered this place in my early 20s on one of my many alcohol fueled nights in the city. Don't take the train absolutely shmizzed, get some amazing pizza. Sober up. Prepare yourself for the journey home. Not only is the pizza slice huge and delicious, the employees are extremely friendly. They see you. They see how intoxicated you are. They want to alleviate that bad headache coming on.I'll probably check my online banking in the morning and regret all the drinks I purchased, but I will never regret you Artichoke Pizza."
1919,"Decent pizza, but not worth the hype in my opinion. I had many friends rave to me about this place in addition to many food blogs that featured this artichoke pizza. Therefore, I was very excited to try this place as it combined some of my 2 favorite things: pizza and spinach and artichoke dip. In addition to getting their namesake pizza, I also got the vodka slice, margherita slice, and a sausage and red onion slice. All were decent slices but nothing mind blowing. I kinda wish the artichoke dip sauce wasn't so Alfredo-like. It's less like artichoke dip and more like artichoke Alfredo. It could use a thicker base and possibly some more garlic and onion seasoning. My least favorite was the margherita slice; it was very mediocre and tasted like any other slice of cheese pizza I could get in New York."
1920,"Probably the best slice I have ever had. I understand the hype... and the prices lol. Tried two slices: the Margherita and White w/ Garlic. Had the White slice first, and thought the flavors were good, nothing too special. However, the Margherita blew me away. Both pizzas had an amazing crust and crispness, but the Margherita was perfect. The basil was baked into the sauce and the tomatoes added the perfect freshness to the pie. Everything worked so well together, nothing overpowering at all. I will be here, hands-down, on my next NYC trek."
1921,"Friendly service. Beautiful pizza. Right by the hotel and always crowded so that means it's a fan favorite. Ammended....I ordered a veggie pie to go, got it in about 12 minutes and headed back to the hotel for a quick bite before we got a ride to the airport -- and opened up the box and it was a meat pizza. I called and they wanted me to bring it back. We didn't have time and they didn't offer anything else. So...we ate a pepporini and what looked like beef slices. Still good. Just looking forward to the incredible veggie pie that was made."
1922,"Amazing. Great selection and variety of flavors. I got 3 slices: the burrata pizza, bbq chicken, and the suprema pizza.Although they were different sizes, they were all huge. The crust was nice and thin and crunchy, which complemented the layers of sauce and cheese on top.My favorite was the burrata one. It is simple but the flavors melded so well together. Would come back again :)))"
1923,"DELICIOUS! We had the margherita, pepperoni, Hawaiian and upside down: all were great! Crust was crispy and chewy and the sauce was outstanding!"
1924,"New Year's Eve Friday, not many people at this quick slice pizza joint. All sorts of options behind the glass and no wait at all to place an order.Decided on one Upside-Down Slice ($4.50), and a Buffalo Ranch Slice ($6). Prices are high, but the portion is large and the ingredients robust. Upside down slice is Sicilian style, thick bread layered with copious amounts of tomato sauce and just the right amount of cheese. Not soggy and easy to eat. Bacon ranch is covered in breaded chicken, bacon, and striped of ranch dressing. High salt content with all the bacon involved, ranch cuts it a bit, though the oil does prevail in the end. Still a pretty good slice, though couldn't finish the whole thing.Cash only if orders are under $10, though I believe they have an ATM inside. Perfect spot for a quick meal without having to deal with many people."
1925,"A longtime favorite for pizza, and judging by the lines is either very good or just a popular tourist attraction, but it's actually both. It has the classic setup of whole pizzas behind glass. NY Pizza Suprema has pizzas available by the slice or whole. Located across from the Garden and Penn Station. The prices have crept up but still worth getting some of this. Check out the history here and then eat. It opened back in 1964 a few years before Madison Square Garden. They have added flavors over the years. It used to only have plain cheese. Now you can get all kinds of food options. Of these there's many that are vegan. It's $6 a slice for the vegan pizzas. That's a lot but these are big though. Among these are a few styles and they usually have at least a couple. The New York Vegan Regular is a replication of the classic slice. It's basic. This has basil, extra virgin olive oil, savory pizza sauce, and vegan mozzarella cheese. Often there's another vegan pizza if you prefer another. The Vegan White is more unique. It's also good. This has cashew ricotta and garlic toppings. Other pizzas are cheaper. The prices are higher than they used to be which is the worst thing about here. A lot of classic and newer styles of pizza to choose from. It usually has plenty of indoor seating. There's good choices for vegans and vegetarians."
1926,"December 2021 - COVID Review:I'm so glad that I found this place on a whim on Yelp due to the reviews. I know I'm not from New York so I wouldn't be able to tell if it's truly authentic NYC pizza - but it was sooo good!All of the slices (cheese, garlic white, buffalo chicken, suprema) that we got are highly recommended! When you go in, you choose from the display what pizzas you want and they heat it up for you while you pay and opt for dine in or takeout. It's located near MSG and Moynihan train station!"
1927,"Pizza Suprema is definitely a superior slice, and fares well with the people who prefer a saucier experience (I personally like a cheesier one). Although they use less cheese, the taste is very much potent, since I believe they use a blend of mozzarella and pecorino. The sauce is somehow both sweet and salty, and tends to ooze out and fall off the crust because how much is packed in. Just like almost every other pizzeria, the service can be a little rushed and rough. I vividly remember that one of the first times I came here, the counter guy was a bit short with me and forgot about my order. He told me to have a seat at a table and that he would bring it out to me once it was ready. He brought me another one on the house for the trouble. Very much like their sauce, this dude was both salty and sweet. Pizza Suprema is on my list of go-tos for good pizza."
1928,"Saw some labels for vegan pizza while walking by and was immediately intrigued. They have a vegan thick crust square pizza LOADED with toppings, and no cheese (veggie pizza), as well as a thin crust triangle slice vegan pizza, also topped with some veggies. I think I also saw two white vegan pizza slices, one with veggies and one without, but I could be mistaken. I got the thick crust pizza to go, and it was decent, but not mind blowing my good. The pizza was piled high with toppings from mushrooms to black olives, onions, fresh tomato, basil, tomato sauce, and probably more. All of this contributed to great flavor, but an overall soggy pizza. Combined with the thick crust, there wasn't much crunch or crisp left. I like the taste of vegetables, so I didn't mind it too much, but it's definitely not what I would consider the pizza flavor profile. It was also pretty good both fresh and cold the next morning. :) Probably won't be coming back considering the slice was $6.50, but I'm sure the other slices will provide a different perhaps better experience."
1929,"I ate about 8 different pizza places on my three day trip to NYC--from Joes's to Juliana's--and while I'd never not go to those places, NY Pizza Suprema was the best.  Tons of choices. Great crust. Hot. Wonderful pizza."
1930,"It's good. not great... but that's just me! Anthony Bourdain ate here? it's super popular... 4 to 6 bucks a slice.... so... maybe i have a set of taste buds built for cheap pizza...  but! this is THE hangout after a concert at Madison Square Gardens... who did I see here? Harry Styles assistant! (if that's how to spell his name)and, some neat folks that barfed and almost passed out... wow! what a scene!anyway... back to the food... yeah... i bet it is great!just not great for me... forgive me Pizza Gods!"
1931,"Absolutely the BEST vegan pizza NY style I've ever had!The crust was crunchy, the thick tomato sauce with real chunks of tomato ufffff and the cheese was sooo good!I want more!!! It is total MUST when in New York!"
1932,Looks like a tourist trap but the pizza here is really good! Our favorite was the fra diavolo - we ended up going back for it before we left the city. The tomato sauce here is the good concentrated kind and none of that weirdly sweet watery mushy kind. Would recommend!
1933,"We were looking for good hot pizza on a cold rainy night. Looking online and checking the reviews, we knew we had try this pizza. The pizza was delivered to our hotel earlier than expected. Hot and fresh just the way we like it!"
1934,"Visited NYC for the first time in forever this past weekend and went to 4-5 different pizza places. NY pizza suprema was definitely my favorite of them all!! Ended up going there 3 times in a week - the chicken bacon ranch slice was amazing (normally I don't even like bacon too but a friend recommended it). Perfect amount of cheese/toppings, great as a quick lunch spot or late night meal"
1935,Prince St who? Joe's Pizza who? This place is seriously underrated in comparison to the other well known pizza spots. I still think about the upside down pizza to this day.
1936,Our regular stop for good pizza. Period. The fact we had 3 slices and two drinks for $18 is not even relevant. I was glad to see they had inside seating. Each booth had a plastic partition. They came to play!This is a must stop for any foody. We go for the simple stuff. Mushroom. Sausage. Cheese. But they have a huge selection of gourmet pizza by the slice.
1937,"Delicious pizza!!! Thin crust pepperoni, margarita, and mushrooms is what we ate! Place is clean and staff was friendly.Also look at the menu ahead of time if your indecisive when it comes to ordering food like me  pizza is order right when you walk in!"
1938,"Ummm perfection??? I had meat lovers + burrata, esp the later. The quality of the basil, olive oil and cheese were like Michelin star. Better than Joe's for sure don't @ me. Right by Penn station, v small walk"
1939,"This place is famous for a reason. I mean they make arguably one of the best pizza slices in all of NYC for semi-reasonable price. Yea, it ain't cheap like many other shops but it's worth the extra bucks. The staff is friendly and the options are amazing. We got the Cheese Lovers and also the Hot Honey which is a great white pizza slice. If you near MSG or just in the area, make sure to grab a quick slice or two here."
1940,i got hungry around midnight and went to suprema to grab a bite. the pizza came out so piping hot i burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite (but would 10/10 do it again bc it was that good). the fig pizza is to die for.
1941,"Amazing pizza, probably the best I've ever had. Highly recommend the burrata pizza! I would absolutely come back here. Try and come in person and eat the slice there because the crispy crust fresh out of the oven is just perfection!"
1942,"Ordered takeout about a mile away from here. They took an hour, price was $40 for a fig pizza. Tasted fabulous, felt price was high and of course we had to reheat. Delivery person brought right up to apt. Very sweet. Would order all over again and so should you."
1943,"Pretty solid pizza spot near Penn station perfect for a quick bite before a trip out. Came here with a friend before an Amtrak ride at Penn Station and it did a filling job but pizza is a little on pricier side (ranging from $4 - $7 per slice). Everything was good and I think the hot honey pizza was particularly great. Although I enjoyed the pepperoni fra diavolo pizza here, I think Prince Street Pizza does a better pepperoni square pie. In my opinion, the slices could also be baked/warmed up a little more too."
1944,"NY Pizza... enough said. I had the meatball, the chicken bacon ranch, and the potato pizzas. All were amazing!  Plus, it is just outside Penn Station. Will be back next time I am in town."
1945,Classic!!! This place oozes cool. The variety of slices is incredible. I went with the Supreme and the Pickle. Excellent pizza and even better crust.
1946,"Whenever I visit NYC by train, the first thing I do is cross the street from Penn Station and grab two slices. Not only does it hit the spot after a long train ride, but it immediately satisfies the requirement of having some great NY pizza within minutes of arrival. That way you can spend the rest of your visit enjoying some of the many different cuisines the city has to offer. NYPS is really the quintessential New York slice. It's crispy, folds nicely with just the right amount of grease dripping onto the plate. They have plenty of toppings available, but they really are not necessary. Plain cheese is a thing of beauty."
1947,"First time visitor to NY, stayed in the Chelsea area (Holiday Inn) and read about this place. It was very authentic NY pizza, even featured on Rachel Ray and Anthony Bourdain stopped at this joint at one point. The pizza is Amazing! If you eat it inside it's ""bigger"" than if you take it home or hotel. Only $28! We had one pizza for 2 adults and 3 kids. Francesco was our server and he was very kind and helpful. Great first impression!"
1948,"We wanted authentic New York style pizza and we got it.It was very busy, and the staff sometimes had difficulty hearing the orders, but the pizza was great.  My daughter had the NY style Pepperoni, while I had the Pepperoni Fra Diavolo Sicilian.  Both were great.A must-visit stop while in New York!"
1949,"Of all the pizza places I been to on my trips to NYC, which isn't many, this is by far the best one.   Several reasons for this too.  1.  I love pizza   2. It was IMHO cheap  and 3. it was hella close to the hotel I was staying at.Its is the picture perfect slice of NYC pizza when you think of it.  The thinness, the toppings and the grease level.   Has to be some grease on it and it was always just right.   The location was cozy in a way. I picked a seat in the way back so that no one can watch me destroy the 3 slices in record time.  I think on my trip there I ate here 4 times. Could of been twice a day because it definitely helped with my tight budget and it was that good.   There are so many choices and I am sure if I lived there I may have found something better by now but I promise if I am in the Chelsea area again....I am hitting up Supreme."
1950,"My family and I came for a Sunday brunch. The restaurant is pretty busy on weekends, so always rsvp ahead of time! Food was overall pretty good. We ordered the tuna tacos, Brussel sprouts for appetizers, and a Jane burger, steak brites, French vanilla bean toasts, and Jane Benedict.The tuna tacos came with 3 pieces, and I dipped it with the decorating spicy sauce on the plate for fun and it tasted even better, I wish they have put some of the spicy sauce aside for people to add as they like. The Brussel sprouts were crispy but I'd love it more if they added a little more vinegar in it. The Jane burger was yummy. I liked it a lot. The best part was they put bacons and caramelized onions in it. The French vanilla bean toasts were sweet and delicious. The portion was huge, we couldn't even finish by sharing it. We listened to our server and picked the Jane Benedict over the salmon Benedict. I'm glad we did. We all enjoyed it a lot and finished the plate. The base biscuit was buttery and flaky, and the crab cake on top of it was just delicious! We enjoyed it the most out of all. The steak frites was a little disappointing on the portion,  it's a very small piece of steak. We asked for medium and it's very tender.The rosemary fries came with the steak and burger were delicious, crunchy and freshly fried. The only part I'm complaining about was when we were about to leave, the busboy came over to clean up the table and knocked over the water to my aunt's jacket, he then proceed to also knock over the syrup and everything to the floor ‍. Otherwise it was nice."
1951,"Sorry folks, this place didn't do it for me. The breakfast was bland and unremarkable. The coffee, rather the creamer, was just weird (more on that later).I stopped in for breakfast, and had a Farmhouse Popover. The description is perhaps a little more exciting than the meal itself. It was a ham omelette, served on top of a popover, with a very lightly dressed salad on the side, if you call a spritz of oil ""dressing"".The omelette was alright, but the popover was bland as could be. Especially in this context of being buried under an underwhelming omelette, it was as good as bread. As for the salad, well, it felt out of the place on the dish as it didn't work with or compliment anything. Plus leaves by themselves don't offer much.Then there was the coffee. On the one hand, I **want** to give the server the benefit of the doubt. She said that the cream is definitely half-and-half and that's the container it came from. On the other hand I've been drinking coffee since high school and tried various creamers. I am telling you: what she believed to be half-and-half was either skim milk or a non-dairy milk alternative. Adding more than twice what I normally do gave the coffee a chocolate color, not the khaki color I seek... to say nothing of flavor. To her credit, even though I didn't make a fuss she brought out some heavy cream, though at that point I just about finished eating and was through almost two cups (and that was it for the morning). Allow me also to say, I am not looking to assign blame. I don't know if something was accidentally mislabeled or watered down, but for some reason, what happened, happened. Sorry folks, this did not end up being a good experience, and I do not see myself returning here when I am in NYC next."
1952,"Everything you don't want to happen at a resturant happened here. We first sat at the bar and you could tell the bartender was extremely overwhelmed. We ordered a wine and waited like 20 minutes but never got it. We just went to our table. I'm pretty sure he forget. When we got to the table we all ordered and that went well except the drinks took forever... shock. My wife ordered the ""skirt steak"". I put quotations around it because it was not a skirt steak. They were selling a skirt steak but serving a piece of sirloin. It was basically a hockey puck and not edible. We had to send it back. And I know it's not a skirt steak because my family owns 12 meat markets and I worked in them for many years. I ordered a salad and asked for no beats and there were indeed beats in my salad. And then to top it all off it was my friends birthday so I went up to the server and ordered a cake with a candle for her. We waited and waited and waited and it never came. We then asked for the check twice. The second time I got up and went over to the server to ask again for it and she was taking selfie's on the iPad at the hostess stand. How embarrassing. We still didn't get our check and I had to grab another server because I didn't see ours. I then asked her for the check and I asked her where our server was and she said she went home for the day. She didn't even finish serving our table and just left..... I wish I knew her name. She had shortish curly blonde hair with a little tiny pony tail on the top of her head and had a choker necklace on. Then we got the check and the birthday dessert that we NEVER got was on the bill!!! This place is a mess and seriously needs some kind of management because its clear there is no one in charge. I would NEVER recommend this resturant to anyone. I couldn't even tell you if all the food was good because the service was so bad."
1953,"Great brunch spot in the West Village especially for big groups! I do love the ambiance inside and it's pretty spacious. Food was pretty good, I ordered the Jane Burger and my friends ordered a Benedict. The french toast does look appealing but definitely want to try it next time! If you like espresso martinis, I highly recommend getting a chi-tini! SO GOOD."
1954,"Jane Restaurant in west village turned out to be a really good spot to get together with friends and catch up while having some food. It felt quieter than nearby establishments, in a good way -- making it easy for conversations. The food selection is a little underwhelming, but the dishes themselves do live up to the promise. We got the fried calamari and the carrots with hummus dishes as appetizers. The former is one of the better versions of the dish I have had. It wasn't just fried batter! The accompanying sauce paired up nicely with the dish too.I ordered the shrimp spaghetti, which was a good choice, considering how tasty it ended up being. Shrimps were aplenty, and there were large and tasty. The spaghetti itself wasn't too salty, and was cooked just right, to make it all come together nicely. Add to that a very warm service, with attentive and helpful waitresses. Very positive experience, indeed."
1955,"Mediocre food, decent brunch experience We arrived early before opening with reservation made in advance but there was already a small line upon opening at 11:30am on Monday (President's day). We chose to sit inside and within an hour or so, the place was packed. Because of how packed it was, service was understandably on the slower pace in terms of getting food served and getting refill of water. At least we had a good talk while waiting and noise level was decent.The best item was the appetizer, the tuna tartar tacos. The sweet chili sauce hit. Sucks it was small and only enough for one per person (went as party of 3). I would totally want this as a main for myself. As for the actual brunch items, they were nothing outstanding. I would say the Jane Burger would be the best out of the 3 but just because the other 2 were just ok in taste. Not sure where the Jalapeño marmalade sauce was at since there was no spice or ting but personally I can pass the spice. It was pretty hefty to stomach first thing in the morning but I managed to eat most of it! The fries was a miss - not sure how they were all cooked so unevenly and the rosemary, nonexistent. Our server was a great lad, made friendly talk when possible and tried his best to check in on us. Excellent service on his end. Noticed there were more tables in the lower floor where the restrooms were located too."
1956,"Solid spot, location wise and also the fact that we were able to get a table around 3:30pm on a Saturday, most spots in area were closed for brunch and didn't re-open till 5ish. Annoying. Anyways I called ahead and they said they could seat us. Thank god.We ordered a bunch of things, chicken sausage, sliders, chicken poppers, Abc&e sandwich and fries. Everything was good and came quick/hot. They also have a happy hour menu 3-7pm daily. Would absolutely recommend!! Drinks were also good too!!!"
1957,"This was a fun place to be. We came on Saturday morning. My husband and I didn't have reservations but were able to sit at the bar.  It was a really cute place.  When you sit at the bar you hear the conversations of the staff. For this particular day they had a big party down stairs and they were expecting 500 guest in the early part of the day. So the staff were busy prepping.My husband got the Jane burger which was really good, with seasoned fries. I got the French toast with strawberries and bananas. The toast was made of brioche and very thick. I also ordered a side of scrambled eggs.  The food was good but the atmosphere was much better."
1958,"Delicious Sunday brunch! My friends and I didn't make a reservation so the hostess said that there was an hour wait time. Fortunately, we didn't actually have to wait long; I think it was less than 30 minutes. We started with drinks while looking at the menu and they were all delicious. Not too strong and it didn't taste entirely like juice. As for food, I definitely recommend the Jane Burger and the Vanilla Bean French Toast! The Jane Burger is a good classic burger that comes with a side of fries. The Vanilla Bean French Toast was hands down the best french toast I have ever tried. It was the perfect sweetness for my taste buds. There is a fluffy creme brulee filling and the outside is the perfect crispiness. To top it off, they add berries, bananas and a side of syrup.The entrees will definitely fill you up and you will not leave the restaurant still hungry. The prices are what you'd expect for NYC, so there are no surprises there. Overall, Jane is a great spot to visit if you're in the area."
1959,"My friends and I came for Sunday brunch and had a great time. We were told we would have to wait about an hour since we didn't make a reservation (and it was basically prime brunch time when we arrived) but we only really waited probably less than 30 minutes. There were flurries of snow outside so there were no parties dining in their outdoor seating, so we ended up waiting there instead. They offered us outdoor seating if we didn't want to wait and there were heat lamps which was good for sitting there to wait but we preferred to dine in. The inside, although crowded with people was bright and had lots of tables. They also have tables downstairs as well. After being seated, we placed our drink orders first. We got a couple of brunch cocktails and regular cocktails. All of us thought the cocktails were great, very fruity and barely able to taste the alcohol but not in a bad way.For entrees, I chose the Jane burger with fries. It's a classic burger but I like that they added bacon cause it added more flavor. They also give a good amount of fries! The fries were thin, more on the soggy side but still tasty, although the rosemary flavor didn't really stand out.I also tried the crab cake benedict which I thought was delicious as well! It was on a fluffy biscuit and the egg could've been a bit runnier but was still a great combination with the crab cake.Lastly, a must get here is the vanilla bean french toast. This has got be my favorite french toast! There were 3 thick half pieces of toast that were crispy on the outside with a fluffy creme brulee interior, and topped off with fresh strawberries and bananas. It was definitely a perfect combination. I didn't find it overly sweet as well. A nice spot for brunch that has a great atmosphere and a variety of both basic and unique brunch items. They also offer happy hours and dinner foods as well but my friends and I were more interested in brunch."
1960,"I have mixed feelings about this place. I think 3 stars is even too much. This place is definitely overhyped for no reason. But let me explain in details my experience.I made a reservation for 11:45 am for brunch. Arrived on time. Checked in with the hostess who asked me to follow her to a table that was supposedly not ready. She asked me to wait- no problem. I wait, then the manager stops by and says ""Yeah I cant give you that table, but please wait"". The table was for 4 and we were a party of 2 so I figured that is what he meant. It did sound rude but I said ok let me see what happens. The hostess lady did come back and try to fix it, she apologized and said it was her first day. And I totally understand, what I didnt get was why the manager was rude to me and frankly not my issue, I had the reservation so why make me wait when the 2 ppl table becomes available? Then the manager just split the 4 ppl table into 2 and said ""you can now sit""...ok I guess all that drama was for no reason?I sat and waited for 20 min for someone to bring the menu. When I waived at the server, he said ""You actually have to check-in with the hostess"". I explained that I did and they seated me. He apologized. But at this point I was not happy already, they seam like they can't handle busy days. Food was ok. Good. Portions large. But nothing special, any other non crowded restaurant serves the same food. Will I be back again? Nope."
1961,"Came here for winter restaurant week 2022.  The specials I chose for RW were the pear and greens salad , the beef bourguignone and the s'mores in a cup.  First , the atmosphere.  On a Tuesday night it was pretty empty but didn't feel uncomfortably empty. As in , the staff was very  welcoming but not intrusive. It's tastefully decorated where it feels cozy and warm for the winter yet I can see in the summer it feeling cool and airy. A great place for any occasion. I had the moulin rouge drink.  It's good and strong ! A pretty magenta colored drink that tastes like a berry flavored margarita. The RW week salad is huge. I mean it's enough to share ! But it's light with Gorgonzola cheese , cooked sliced pears , grapes and leafy greens with candied walnuts. And just the right amount of dressing that wasn't overpowering.  I was able to finish it on my own. The RW special was their beef bourguinone.  Get it if it's on the menu.  Tender beef that melts in your mouth with a wonderful flavorful dark gravy made traditionally with bacon lardons and wild mushrooms.  Comes with a side of mashed potatoes.  Soo good  On to dessert.  It was chocolate mousse in a glass with a graham cracker bottom and toasted marshmallows on top.  It went well with my salted maple latte with a shot of rum.  Prices are very reasonable! 4 dollar mini Jane burgers for HH! And from the size I've seen in pics it's still a hefty burger made just like their regular famous Jane burger. I will be returning to try that !!Thanks Jane for being around so long. I will return !"
1962,Was strolling around Soho one fine winter morning and came across this restaurant on Yelp and decided to try it.Glad we stopped by..  .Nice cozy place with a great menu.We tried a few items and liked all of them.Avacado egg sandwich on a soft well toasted bun and the eggs were done right with chipotle dressing on the side. Jane breakfast eggs with wheat toast and house potatoes and peppers and chicken sausage.. Yummy French toast with thick bread -was a bit overly sweet but we enjoyed it ...Rosemary flavored French fries - very good flavor Def visit if you are in the area
1963,Snuck in this morning. Haven't been here since before the pandemic. Was nice to see that it's still the same quality and service
1964,Nice place for Sunday brunch with friends...highly recommend making reservations. Service and staff were good. There is a bar and some seating available there. Main seating is on the main floor and downstairs for parties. restrooms are downstairs.  Make reservations online and select indoor or outdoor seating.  They will not seat you until your entire party arrives. Variety to choose from on the menu and daily happy hour specials from 3pm-7pm daily.Don't forget your face masks and proof of vax!Tuna tartare tacos were delicious!! they come as 3 per order...we had 2 orders. White peach bellini was nice and light to go with brunch. Had the Jane breakfast - eggs (however you like them cooked) with bacon (or sausage) with homefries and toast.  Food was good - expensive when you start adding alcohol with it. Definitely a place to back to again.
1965,"I've been coming to Jane for brunch for a while now, but this most recent time was extremely disappointing. First, we had to wait over 15 minutes for a table even though we had a reservation. The table the placed us at did t have silverware or anything ready. They brought us the wrong drink order. They brought us the wrong food order. Overall, the place seemed unprepared and uninterested in providing good service. What used to be a staple for me has turned into a real shame."
1966,"We came here on a Sunday morning.  The place was packed and although we had reservations, we were seated outside.  We were surprised that their coffee option was very limited.  So we ordered their lattes and they were disappointing.  We also ordered their tuna tacos and they didn't taste fresh at all.  We ordered the salmon Benedict that I really liked and I would recommend.  We also ordered the goat cheese and spinach omelette which I found slightly dry, it did come with diced fried potatoes which I found delicious."
1967,"Came here for Sunday brunch, I had always seen this restaurant but did not realize how large it was on the inside. We were seated in the basement, and the whole time when we were eating, they kept playing music on the speakers except the volume kept changing. I felt like I was screaming to talk to the person right across from me. I got the Classic Eggs Benedict, but honestly I've had better. The biscuit was cold and the greens didn't seem very fresh. I probably wouldn't come back here, I think there are better places for brunch in the area."
1968,"We were only able to get an outdoor reservation for a party of three for 11:15 on a Sunday. It was a very chilly day so everything we ordered got cold really fast. Definitely not the restaurant's fault. I'm curious to see if they're going to install heat lamps when the temperature continues to dip.We each got a non alcoholic beverage. My salted maple latte was very good albeit cold. My friends got the coffee and tea.For our entrees, two of us got the fried chicken sandwich with fries and the other one with a rather sweet tooth ordered the French toast with a side of bacon. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't also any thing special. To top things off, my friend's fries came with an unexpected hair tie! They kindly and quickly replaced her French fries.All in all, it wasn't a bad experience, but it also wasn't a great experience."
1969,"Really good spot for brunch. Good food, good drinks.The steak frites was perfectly done but I wish I had ordered some vegetables on the side because the fries were a little dry. My boyfriend had an omelette and a glass of their famous Bloody Mary; he enjoyed both of them especially the drink. Servers were also very nice.Overall, it's a good spot for brunch just not too outstanding. Maybe if I come back, I would change my mind if I ordered something else but so far these are my thoughts."
1970,So I guess the hype is rightfully earned. We had a resy for brunch for 4 on a Sunday and it was really busy. We got seated right away. The waiter was attentive and nice. Ordered the chicken sandwich with rosemary fries and the French toast and OMG both were delightful. The French toast as dessert was *chefs kiss*. So moist and fluffy! Would recommend this place anytime! Make sure to make resy before time tho!
1971,I went back to Jane after my first review to see if there were any changes to my initial experience.It was more or less the same but just more chaotic in terms of floor management.I was seated right next to the hostess table where the servers and bus servers were constantly squeezing themselves behind me hitting me. It was a full house without zero covid consciousness.It's great that they are checking for vaccinations but i think the restaurant really need to realize that people still catch Covid after the vaccination and they need to play more on safe side here...I would remove a table or two from the floor to space them out and make more room for the servers to move around so the customers are not getting shoved every other mins.Food was good- fresh ingredients but the service and floor management wise I would not recommend for anyone that's conscious of Covid.
1972,"Overwhelmingly average. I got the chicken sandwich and there was virtually no flavor to it. The calamari wasn't good either. Fries were decent though.My lady got a mini burger that was good but the chicken poppers weren't hitting like they were supposed to.Overall, this place was bit of a let down."
1973,"Can't go wrong with a very traditional American brunch. Eggs Benny, French toast, and my favorite, their avocado breakfast sandwich. The customer service here is great. There's plenty of seating for large and small parties. Came here on a weekday morning and there wasn't any wait, was seated immediately!"
1974,"Great Sunday brunch! Had a reservation for 5 people, we were seated on time and had great service even on a busy Sunday.Brunch cocktails - bloody mary was delicious and just the right amount of heat. I prefer spice and my friend doesn't and we were both happy.Popover omelet (farmhouse popover?) Was really good and a great portion with flakey popover. We all shared deviled eggs and Brussels sprouts and all enjoyed.Highly recommend for brunch"
1975,"Disappointed.It felt like Jane ""aged"" since I last came two years ago. The interior looks worn out. Sunday afternoon 3:30pm. Approx half the restaurant was filled, so no issues getting a walk in seat. The noise level was moderate but I can imagine it being too much for me when full. Their background music was very varied too. It went from metal to pop to country...After being seated, it took ten minutes for someone to acknowledge me and give me water and take my order. That is not acceptable especially during a low peak time. I chose the Jane burger. The happy hour menu had a mini version for much less but I still went with the regular order. I realized after ordering that I wasn't asked whether I wanted fries or salad. Good thing it came out with fries. Pictures look like they give a lot. Same for mine. There was a problem of the fries being too short, soggy, and dark. The rosemary gave it flavoring but also a sense of heaviness perhaps from my association of rosemary with chicken. The burger itself was heavy too. The beef was fatty. Pickled tomatoes are new too me but it wasn't sour enough to cut through the meat. There's cheddar but I can't recall it at all, mild. There was supposed to be jalapeño marmalade but I can't taste it anywhere. I was actually looking forward to trying that. My favorite part of the burger is probably the bacon. It was crunchy and not too salty. Various servers checked in on me multiple times during the course of the meal, but that couldn't make up for the bad beginning. Thanks but no thanks. I don't actually need that much attention when I'm eating the same item the whole time. I won't suddenly go from ""ok"" to hating the burger within 10min."
1976,"I don't know how they make the toasted ricotta gnocchi and frankly, as long as it's on my plate, I don't care. Each gnocchi is thick and bready, almost like tiny pieces of garlicky, cheesy breadsticks yet a wee bit softer on account of being made with potato. Amazing texture. As if that weren't enough, an order comes sitting atop an incredible, cheese based white sauce that you won't waste a drop of. It's a flavor bomb of buttery, cheesy magnificence that you'll dredge every single bite through before blessing your taste buds. One of the most addicting things I've ever eaten.High notes for the calamari as well. It comes freshly fried with a healthy coating of crunchy breading, just the right amount of oil and salt and they sprinkle in a few bits of red and green jalapeño for a nice added kick.Indoor and outdoor seating is available, friendly service, full bar and a very nicely kept restaurant."
1977,"Stopped by Jane for brunch with a friend the other week and ordered the crispy buttermilk chicken sandwich with rosemary fries and a coffee. The coffee was strong, and the sandwich and fries were quite good. My friend enjoyed her breakfast of eggs and salad (and half my fries, haha). Our server was very nice as well.Jane has a spacious dining room, outdoor seating, and more space downstairs. When we arrived, we were the only people sitting inside, as it was a weekday and rather early. My one grievance was there were lip marks from a previous patron on my water glass before it was filled, but I didn't want to make a fuss about it at the time, so I just ignored it."
1978,"The French toast was really good. Tuna tacos were just okay. Service was okay. But I'll definitely not recommend this place. It's a smoking free restaurant, but the kitchen itself was smoking. The in door air quality is harming human's health. Just walk outside and go back, you'll understand. Definitely not friendly, especially to those who have asthma or other similar issues."
1979,"Adorable atmosphere, friendly and attentive service (thanks Patrick!) and super super delicious drinks and food! Definitely coming back!!!"
1980,"We came here for brunch on my husband's birthday and really enjoyed the food. The Avocado eggs Benedict was really good (although a bit under-seasoned IMO). However the French Toast was BOMB. My kids also enjoyed the ""milk and cookie"" as a dessert which was a scoop of vanilla ice cream in milk with 3 huge warm chocolate chip cookies. Overall, we enjoyed our time here and had a wonderful waiter."
1981,"My first time at Jane Restaurant happened to be during Restaurant Week 2022 and while I've never participated in restaurant week before, this was such a pleasant and wonderful experience. I wish I had taken more picture to fully detail the evening. The beef bourguignon was extremely comforting and tender i was definitely impressed by the portion . My meal special was only for $39 and included a soup and a s'mores in a jar for dessert. 9/10"
1982,Another example of high reviews and underselling food! Maybe one day they were good (?) but nothing to impress now. Among everything we ordered their breakfast sandwich was the best.
1983,Dined here on a Thursday night with a friend for Restaurant Week and had a great time! It wasn't crowded for a weekday night which was nice and the place itself was pretty spacious. We started off with the crispy calamari which was delicious and hot and not rubbery or greasy at all! Highly recommend. We also had a few glasses of wine (I had a Cab and a glass of the house white and my friend had two glasses of cava). The wine was very good and it was an added treat that we were able to enjoy them at the happy hour price! For RW appetizers we ordered the free range chicken soup which was very fresh with dill. For entrees we ordered the beef Bourguignon and the Atlantic cod. Both entrees were divine!! I especially loved the pesto on the Atlantic cod! For dessert we got the s'mores in a jar which was very rich and decadent. Would have been even better with ice cream but overall the meal was delicious!!
1984,"Enjoyed my omelette here, it was pretty standard and dare I say it, forgettable. I appreciate that it came with toast and lots of butter, which I love. We sat at the bar where we had varying levels of service. Overall Jane is a decent, reliable place but it's not going to blow you away."
1985,"Popular and yummy brunch place, can get pretty crowded but definitely worth a try. Tried the vanilla bean french toast, which is 3 slices of fluffy, not-too-sweet brioche with strawberries and bananas. Also shared the avocado toast which has two poached eggs on top and served with mixed greens. Would recommend both and service was very attentive and friendly!"
1986,"The food was really good. I really loved the scrambled eggs and fries. The burger was good but wasn't mind blowing. The french toast was also good but the edges were dry and rough. We also good different coffees (mocha, iced latte, oat milk salted maple latte) and they were okay, the salted maple latte wasn't good though - the salt settled at the bottom and was not a great tasteOverall, good food but could improve to be amazing food."
1987,"Jane looked so good on paper but unfortunately wasn't super great. Hate leaving 3 stars but my whole table had a lot to say. We came for brunch and called ahead of time to make sure we got seated asap as we had a long day ahead. We got sat outside. It was a fairly chilly morning and wish they gave us the option to sit inside. The food menu price is more on the higher end average ~$18-$20s+ per plate and the portions were on the smaller side especially the benedicts. someone subbed their side salad for potatoes and our waitress didnt let us know that it was an extra $3 charge and it wasn't that much in serving. Most of our plates felt like it lacked a big of flavor. Like when you take a bite you're expecting more fragrance and punch of flavor but its just like ""ehh"" Also ordered a cup of hot coffee and it tasted like instant coffee. And for it costing almost $5 is a big oof for me. Each person paid more than we expected for a meal we finished and ended up hitting a bakery because we were still hungry. We thought it was NYC pricing and food but ended up finding more places the following days that were better in portion and price. One of us also got a dirty drinking glass and it did turn off the vibe of the place. Especially during this time, I'm hoping all glasses and silverware are cleaned thoroughly and not just a quick rinse!"
1988,Cramped tables and the most basic menu and so overpriced. Not worth the wait for brunch.
1989,"Delicious food, classy ambiance, attentive service. What's not to like? Not crowded on a Monday evening. Menu could be more interesting, but I preferred the classy, not crowded atmosphere, above all, especially in these COVID times. I will definitely be back!"
1990,Spent the weekend in NY and was able to try their waffles. They were amazing. Highly recommend. Pricey but worth it.
1991,"I absolutely love Wafels & Dinges! I have actually tried their food probably 3 years ago and I was drawn towards to them by the smell of fresh waffles! This time, we were walking around Bryant park and I had to get something again because of my first great experience. My friend and I got the throw down ($8.93) and I was in love! It was covered with whipped cream and cookie crumble. It was so delicious!!! The only problem was that the waffle was cold when I sat down (probably because it was cold outside lol). I also had their Belgian cocoa and it was all right in my opinion. It wasn't as sweet as I wanted it to be. Highly recommend this yummy snack place!"
1992,"It's super cute in the middle of Bryant park, I got it cause I wanted something warm and it was okay. I wish it would've had less whip cream on it but if you are a fan then go for it the flavor was good I just wasn't a huge fan."
1993,Pretty underwhelming and way too pricy for a Belgian Waffle. Not crispy at all on the outside and the dinges flavors are pretty overpowering.
1994,Hello. Glad I can write an update and get active on this again. I had the lovely time to ask them to be a vendor on a party. Please be weary when booking a party with this team. They do not honor what they say and change the story then try to use pressure to book your event. Rossanna really needs to know how to take basic classes in customer service. Feel free to message to me to see the full private conversation. Thank you!
1995,"I love stopping here for a liege wafel whilst walking the city. When I first found out about this truck I followed them on Twitter, as it was the only place they would post their location daily. Fast forward to now and they've got their own dedicated stands in the city"
1996,"Umm there's nothing NOT to like about this place. Waffles? Good. Chocolate? Good. HOT chocolate? Good. I come here every time I am back in NYC. It is cheap, fast, and delicious. Come here if you need a dose of happiness and sugar! Oh and it makes for a great Instagram story/post if you're into that sort of thing."
1997,Great place for waffles! We stopped by here in times Square New York. We loved this as a snack or desert. We ordered our long time favorite strawberry and banana with chocolate waffles and we loved it! They have few branches around New York too! Service is quick!
1998,"If this place were named after my reviews, they'd have to change it to ""Waffling & D**k-jokes."" I may be prone to verbal diatribe and childish humour (if you can call it humour), but at least I'm self-aware. Then again, they said Leopold of Belgium was self-aware, and that didn't help him much. Speaking of which, we did an online poll of ""sexiest somewhat feminine actors"" and Leo-polled highest. DiCaprio that is. So on with the review.What to get: Liege Waffle with Spekuloos.What the f*** is Spekuloos: It's when you can't find your glasses. Duh.And what else: Well, the Spekuloos Ice Cream is pretty amazing too.What's the difference between a Liege Waffle and the other kind?: Well, the other kind are good, but this one is in a Liege of its own.But this is in America, not Belgium: I know. And much like 'Murca, if you don't like it, then why don't you liege.If this place were frequented by ducks rather than humans, and was also really dirty inside, then it'd be called ""Waddles & Dingy."" Whereas if I had a bright idea (lightbulb switches on above my head, cartoon style) about time travelling, then it'd be ""Wormholes & Ding!""I won't go on and on about these waffles. I'll just tell you straight away: these are by far the best waffles I've ever had in the United States. I'm not a huge waffle fan, but when I go to Belgium, I fall in love with the taste of the dense, sticky, orgasmic Liege Waffles, perfected at Maison Dandoy in Brussels. Well these may not be on the MD level, but these are the closest thing you will ever find in North America, that's for sure. They taste a lot more Belgian than they do American, and that is a very, very good thing.People ask why I'm so attracted to Borat. I think it was his ""Onesies & Dimples."" It must be that because it ain't his face. He's a tip drill.Adding the Spekuloos just takes it through the roof. It's a Gingerbread Spread (think Nutella, but even more addictive), which comes - of course - from Belgium. Also known as Belgique (French) or Belgie (Flemish). Flemish is basically like Dutch, but a Belgian version of it. The country is split between the two languages. The French speakers are known as Walloons. But history and geography lessons aside, Belgium really does make the best waffles on earth, and these Liege Wafles with Spekuloos really are the closest thing to the real thing you can get over here.If you're in a ""linen cleaning contest"" make sure you get the linens *absolutely* clean. Because if there's a tiny bit of dirt, even a little speck of dust, you lose. This concept is known as ""Speck-u-lose.""Not only am I obsessed with them (and I'm not even a waffle fan), but everyone I've ever taken here, fell in love with them too. They're sticky and gooey and hot and sexy. They're heavenly and divine and delectable and filling too. You can split one with someone since they're heavy, and they're not too expensive either.I'm not sure whether there are any illegal drugs in the Spekuloos. I'd rather not Spekulate.As I said, get the amazing Spekuloos all over them, and be aware that they also have Spekuloos (Gingerbread) Ice Cream here which is absolutely divine as well. They're open extremely late (usually until 11 or Midnight or later, but it seems to vary and they do close a bit before the posted time). They're on a lovely little street corner in a cute part of Manhattan just north of Houston St and not far from Sunny & Annie's 24 Hour Korean Deli (which is amazing too - I just reviewed it).Oh and you know that movie, Star Trek III: The Search For Spock? Well in Belgium, that movie was known as ""Spock-u-lost.""If you come to Manhattan, you simply must make it a point to stop in here and try a Liege Waffle with Spekuloos. It may just be one of the best desserts you will ever consume in America.If I have a whole bunch of girls asking to be spanked, then I'd rather save the best for last, honey. And since you're the best, that means I'm going to ""Spankulast.""Wafles & Dinges. Get here. Be amazed.Although if it were my 2 favourite things to get in back alleys in Chinatown, then it'd be ""Won-Ton & D**k."" Ooh I just turned myself on."
1999,This place was disappointing to say the least we got Cekulis spread that was awful. It is very dry and we were disappointed do not come here
2000,This is one of my favorite treats to get! There is nothing like a waffle with speculos or Nutella from Wafels & Dinges. Highly recommend!
2001,"I can't think of one negative thing to say about this location. It is in Times Square and has a few tables and chairs in front for you to actually sit down and enjoy your meal while getting in some good people watching. I had one topped with strawberries and cream and we also got one with bacon that was difficult not to steal every bite! The staff was friendly, the wafles delicious, and the coffee hot. With clean surfaces, the perfect location, fast service, and a full belly for under $20, what more could you ask for?"
2002,"Wafels & Dinges is a Belgian waffle food truck at one of the entrances of Central Park. They have all sorts of topping options! We got The Bom (vanilla ice cream) with Speculoos cookie spread and chocolate fudge. The chocolate fudge works perfectly with the ice cream and waffle, Speculoos not needed. The waffle was so soft, chewy and warm, everything together felt like heaven in my mouth. I wish we had W&D in the Bay Area!"
2003,"Right of the pier over the Hudson so the scenery was beautiful. Not much of a chocolate fan but this was subtly really good even after being drenched in fudge. The ice cream wasn't too sweet , it reminded me of a more organic ice cream. Me and my boyfriend just happened about it random on an adventure for my food blog on Instagram ( @uhplace2taste check it out for more places and pictures). The man was really sweet even when it took me a very long time to decide on my toppings and he piled on the sweets for us. Definitely would go back again."
2004,"Dinges!!! After seeing them multiple times on food shows, I always wanted to try them. I was never in the same area they were but I got lucky and walked upon them finally!Friendly staff, waffles comes out quick. Love the BYO waffle concept. You get one dinges (topping) free and each one is another buck. Liege Waffle w/ Strawberries and Peanut Butter - $6.43 + $1 - Liege waffles are oval shaped vs the belgian which is square. It also has pearl sugar in the batter which adds a nice burst of melty caramelized sugar in the waffle. Waffle was crispy and fluffy and I loved it with my topping combo."
2005,"Luckily I got lost looking for a specific bagel place and stumbled upon Wafels and Dinges instead!I didn't want the complicated-looking numbered creations, but had noooo idea how to order otherwise. The nice guy at the register explained how the toppings worked: your first is free, and you pay per topping thereafter. I ordered Nutella and walnuts on my wafel, along with a small coffee. It was something like $9 - a splurge for sure, but pretty large in size.Holy. delicious. warm. melty. sugary. goodness!  There was also powdered sugar on the bottom. Messy, indulgent - did I mention sugary?? - start to my day!  om noms!Why don't we have Wafels and Dinges in Chicago?!  This needs to be remedied!I'd definitely return when I visit NYC again!"
2006,"W&F is like dying and being let into heaven's gates featuring a line waiting for hot waffles and any topping you desire. Wafels & Dinges gives you the experience of being in Europe and indulging in the treats your heart desires right here in midtown Manhattan.From the moment you step off the train, you smell the alluring fragrance of sugar and you are drawn to this cart. I took my daughter to try one for the very first time and she decided on ""World's Fair"" which features strawberries, powdered sugar and whipped cream. I decided on the Speckuloos Cookie Butter and whipped cream topped one. Both were melt in your mouth good ! Orgasmic ! I love the plethora of toppings they offer. $9-14 is pretty steep for a waffle but I promise every tourist and New Yorker.. it's sooooooo worth it!"
2007,"Remember your high school crush that you hadn't seen in years and then you run into him and all those feelings return? Yea. I used to eat wafels & dinges obsessively circa 2013. I stalked the trucks, religiously visited them at the Christmas Shoppes and even followed their Facebook account for updates. Okay, maybe it was more of a stalker relationship. Anyway, life or the general cut back on sugar idea kicked in and I gave my beloved wafels a break--until this morning. I was hastily making my way to the train station when a familiar scent danced it's way into my olfactory nerve and almost robotically, I found my body doing a u-turn and standing in the wafel line. So here I was. I wish I could say it was voluntary, but it was almost automatic. As a compromise, I didn't do the usual Nutella, strawberry, banana works. Instead, I just opted for a liege with strawberries. I'm happy to say the wafels are still chewy and just a tad sticky as I lovingly remember them. Thank you, Wafels. And you too, dinges."
2008,"Amazing dessert to share. It's incredibly sweet though, I wouldn't be able to finish a whole one on my own just a couple bites is enough. They have a few decadent combinations on the menu but I created my own to avoid drizzles. Still almost got a cavity but it was worth it.These trucks are hard to miss around NYC so it was a must try - and glad I did!"
2009,"The smells coming out of any one of their locations is insane! Their toppings do not withstand the heat from the wafel very well though. One minute my De Churro was the thing of perfection, and the next the whipped cream was sliding to the left and the dulce de leche melted all over the wafel, making a mess. An ugly delicious mess.Their Spekuloos spread (sold in jars) tastes something like gingersnap caramel sugar cookies. Yes it's insane. I've had it on toast, over ice cream, mixed into hot cocoa, all over my blouse, etc. It's best on one of W&D's crispy wafels, but will have to tide me over until the next visit. Now, about that dry cleaning bill."
2010,"My favorite mobile truck! Trying their Central Park cart for today. Their liege ( waffle) as advertised that soft and chewy is true. I could attest to that. An included free dinge ( topping) will make your meal for $6. They have 10 choices of dinges and each additional topping is $1 . If you are an ice cream lover, you could top it off for extra $2. Unlimited toppings is $3. I am okay with one topping and an ice cream . For me, if you over top it, loses the waffle concentration.  Oh well, it depends on what you preference. The location is just perfect , in the middle of the park, close to the Delacorte theater ,  lots of  park benches nearby and easy garbage disposal access. Sweet staff serviced us today and did not give me hard time claiming my Yelp deal offer. I got a $1 off for checking in. The benefit of being a Yelper."
2011,"Best place for waffles. We had their caramel chocolate walnut , dulce de leche waffle and I absolutely loved it. I can't wait to go back and try all their waffles and dinges!"
2012,"To be honest, the product is a little overrated for my taste. The waffle I got wasn't too soft and tasted a bit stale actually which is weird since they make them fresh. Willing to give it another shot but be careful because their desserts are SUPER sweet. Wouldn't recommend any waffles with bacon either."
2013,"I've only tried it once, but that was more than enough for me.It's super heavy - extremely sweet and doesn't really taste like a homemade waffle. The topping options are pretty standard as well : strawberries bananas chocolate syrup & whipped cream. What was good was the spekuloos (sp?)spread. That was tasty and the guy gave it to us as an extra topping on the side so it was a plus. But the waffles are pricey for something that's not all that.They may smell great as you approach the cart in Central Park, but with all of the quality sweets throughout the city, I think I'll pass."
2014,"Do not come here for anything but their sweet waffle or ice cream. Everything else is poorly done. Arrived with a Groupon, that came with 2 savory waffles, 2 drinks, and 2 ice cream cones. The drinks only deserve 0 stars: tried the vanilla matcha chai and the regular chai, both iced. The lady behind the counter was clearly new, because she kept asking her coworker for help (who was on his laptop at the counter against the window). The chais were straight up just 90% milk & ice, and half a pump of a syrup of some kind. Ours tasted exactly the same, even though we ordered 2 different drinks. For $4.50 each, I would have given 0 stars if possible.The waffles get 1 star. My friend had the Smoked salmon waffle, and enjoyed it. I tried his, but felt the actual waffle was masked by the sour cream. The smoked salmon was a little too brown for me, but he didn't seem to notice.I got the ""Wake up, Grumpy"", with bacon. It was sickeningly sweet, charred bacon bits. The description said it came with a biscuit waffle, but I was served a hashbrown waffle, which was sour. The eggs were good (scrambled) but the meal didn't match the description.The ice creams deserved 4 stars. The cones were tasty, and the server offered to fill them with fudge before the ice cream, which was delicious. The spekaloos ice cream is incredible! Tiny scoops, but fantastic. While we were waiting for our ice cream, I saw 2 huge flies, flying around and landing quite often on the waffles that were pre-made, on display. I hope to God that those waffles are not served to customers, and they are only for show. I saw those flies hop around to almost every waffle, even when the waitress was nearby. Ahh!I will give them a positive remark, because they were offering free hot chai to passersby. A homeless man approached, and was physically unable to help himself to the vessel. The waitress kindly helped him get a cup, which I will give them another star for, because it was flat out gracious. 2 stars in total: despicable food & drinks, very good ice cream, flies actually touching the food and no one shooing them away, but kind to homeless strangers."
2015,"A couple of summers ago, I was interning for a television talk show near Columbus Circle. I would pass the Wafels and Dinges truck on my way to work everyday. I decided that one day when I would get to Columbus Circle very early, I would stop and get a waffle before work. That day was a life-changing day in terms of food experiences... and most possibly spiritual experiences. I walked up to the truck and ordered the Throwdown Waffle. I had never tried speculoos until then and was very curious about it. Cookie butter spread? That had to be something good. I took my warm waffle and walked to a nearby bench. I took a bite out of my waffle and all of a sudden the whole city... went quiet. And before I knew it, I was floating on a cloud. It is the most interesting experience for the whole island of Manhattan, in all of its noise and hustle n' bustle, to all of a sudden be blocked out for a solid ten minutes. I was at peace and felt quite ethereal eating a large, fluffy waffle, with my new love of cookie butter and whipped cream. It is since then that I call speculoos, ""the new Nutella.""It was on my Bucket List to experience bliss. I had never experienced bliss before and I never thought I would cross it off my Bucket List due to an experience from eating a waffle. Oh, the places we can find ourselves."
2016,"I had gingerbread cookie and vanilla ice cream today at their Bryant Park truck and... WOW... just wow!$7 ice cream that's totally worth it for onceAlso, the server was the nicest ever!"
2017,I've been going to this place ever since it opened. The liege waffle is a must. I always the BOM with Nutella and it's soooo good. Not the cheapest waffle place but prices have been going up ever since they opened.
2018,Spectacular waffles!!! The people are very nice and had the food came out quickly. Definitely worth a stop to get a waffle and load it up with dinges!
2019,"Maybe I was really hungry, maybe I was really cold but all I know is.. That warm soft waffle with a perfectly crispy exterior, covered in strawberries and whipped cream absolutely hit the spot. We ordered one waffle to share and really wish we got our own. There was one guy working but the lines moved pretty quickly."
2020,"My friend mentioned this place was on a list of places to eat at in NYC so when I saw the cart in Central Park, I didn't even hesitate to order. I ordered a liege wafel with speculoos and it was so damn good. The warmth of the waffle coupled with the meltiness of the speculoos spread was so satisfying! It was hard not to make a mess of myself lol. The price isn't that great ($7) but it's an experience. Maybe I'll come back if I'm looking for a warm sweet mmm But it's not good enough to have me crawling back anytime soon :P"
2021,"Very yummy and nice to look at. If you have a sweet tooth, these waffles are a must! I do not usually gravitate towards sweet foods, however, this was definitely very delicious and I would definitely go again"
2022,"I was hurrying to work the other day and I didn't have a chance to eat my lunch. Some tempting and sweet smell was around the waffle cart, so I just couldn't pass it without trying! I ordered simple waffle with Nutella, nothing special, but it was suuuper delicious. For less then 10$ you can get full and have a wonderful mood, because your endorphins will dance salsa after this. P.S. Take a lot of napkins."
2023,"I don't usually like Belgian waffles but now that I know they can taste like this, I'm definitely reconsidering. I had a wafel with speculoos spread, whipped cream, strawberries, bananas and Belgian hot fudge. My friend had a wafel with speculoos ice cream and dulce de leche. Both wafels were amazing (I think you could put together just about any combination and it would be good). Their iced coffee is also excellent - I think it's a brooklyn toaster. Next time I want to find a truck because the mystery location process is definitely appealing to me."
2024,"Very tasty!!  I would've preferred a fresh eagle instead of a reheated one though .  Also, I was a bit disappointed with the service. I ordered the De Double Trouble, which had a description of whipped cream, strawberries, Nutella and cookie crumbles.  However, what I got had bananas in it ‍.  They also needed more people working.  Times Square is such a busy area and there was only one person doing everything."
2025,"Perfection!  We ordered an assortment (fruit, Nutella, pecans and ice cream) and everybody loved all that we ordered. We purchased ours at the location at the Bryant Park Christmas market and sad and ate them while people watching. Such a treat!Cant wait to head back in to the city to load up again!"
2026,"I have been a fan of Wafels & Dinges food truck for quite some time now. There is nothing better than a freshly made Belgian waffle with countless amounts of toppings! Though their truck can be hard to find from time to time their website will keep you in the loop as to there whereabouts. They can seem to be a little expensive but it is well worth it in my opinion. I usually go for the whipped cream, strawberries and bananas with either hot fudge or the melted caramel topping. I really love the little bits of sugar that are baked throughout the waffle providing a really enjoyable crunch!If you see this truck make sure to grab yourself a delicious waffle!"
2027,"Here's a place I forgot to review many years ago, but it was still a very memorable waffle that I had. 4.5What makes the waffles here stand out is that the crust is a little bit harder than a standard waffle, but it provides a great contrast for the warm softness inside. It's topped with cut strawberries and a light amount of maple syrup, so you get a fresh semi-tart flavor that warms into a deep caramel flavor; it's sweet but not so much that you can't taste anything else."
2028,"Update - the owner actually responded to my comments below and I was very pleased. 11/18 I really wanted to try this treat which I heard about all the way In California. Unfortunately, My husband and walked up to the truck in Times Square today and the two guys working in the booth wouldn't even look up from their phones. When I asked them if they wanted some business they just smiled and didn't respond. I didn't feel like they deserved our business. Find employees that want to actually support your busine"
2029,"My husband and I went to Central Park for a picnic- and stayed at the Great Lawn- with a great spot at that. I did the whole nine yards: wine, baguette sandwiches- you name it- I (almost) had it. While having our Lunch, I smell this awesome, sweet scent in the air. The scent comes and goes several times. For a minute I lost my senses as I was actually following the freaking scent. Hubby and I decided to whip out the frisbee and play for a while. Back to our blanket we go and in comes that scent again. Now I was going a bit nuts and since I didn't bring any cookies/pastries that unknown scent, opened my appetite for something sweet. Lo and behold, as we're wrapping up, my hubby asked if I wanted ice cream or waffles (because he had a sample of a waffle at another location). As he is looking for nearby locations, a 'Food Truck', pops up in our search!! As a matter of fact, a few feet away from where we were picnicing.Freaking crazy---all this time in the Great Lawn and we had no clue. After our solved mystery- I was anxious to try this craze! And boy was it worth it. The Spekuloos Spread, Ice Cream, I can go on and on!!! Addicting- that's all I can say! It's crunchy, fluffy and soft. What an excellent taste combination!'"
2030,"Messy? Oh yeah, you're gonna need at least 5 napkins. Delicious? Hell yes! Fattening? Don't ask. Worth it? Resounding yes. Stumbled upon this food truck randomly and they were giving away free wafels for an event. Wasn't terribly hungry but who the heck would turn down free dessert? Not this girl. I had the s'mores wafel which was everything I hoped it would be- chocolatey, marshmallowy, wafel goodness. I had a tummy ache and chocolate all over my face after, but it was definitely worth it! Would I go back again? Maybe after a 10 mile stroll through the city, but if you've never tried this place before, go for it!"
2031,"Heard this place had the best waffles (or wafles) ever so I had to give them a shot. I liked the ability to decorate my waffle how I wanted but, they already had a delicious list of choices.I ordered De Turtle. Very sweet!"
2032,"I got ""de double trouble"" and OMG!!! I would fly back to New York just for this. Actually this is my fourth time coming to Wafels and Dinges and it is so simple but so good. De Double Trouble is time perfect for sharing, maybe for a max of three people. Bananas, Strawberries, whipped Cream and of course their famous waffles. Price is a little high especially for a side of ice cream which cost us about $5, but overall it is totally worth it. We did not wait long, and location is prime. Right in the heart of time square. I will most likely hit this spot one more time before we leave."
2033,"As expensive as the waffles are, I like to treat myself whenever I'm able to travel to the city and visit them. I have a huge sweet tooth but the toppings can be overwhelming sometimes, however I'm perfectly content with the waffle by itself. The fresh mint lemonade is one that I've tried recently and it became a favorite with the summer heat. Overall, I definitely recommend this place if you love waffles and looking for a dessert to end your visit in the city!"
2034,One of my favorite quick stops for some sweets when im in NYC.  We've tried the stand by Central Park numerous times and the actual storefront once. The waffles have always been fresh with a nice crunch on the outside and soft on the inside.  I have to stop myself from eating the fork when I bite into the delicious goodness. The toppings are always on point from the strawberries and whipped cream to the ice cream and chocolate.  My new favorite is the cookie butter and jelly waffle. Will continue to stop through as they've never disappointed.
2035,"Been to other Wafels and Dinges places before. Most of them are good outside of the Bryant Park one which is I think a little bit lower quality by comparison, at least for the waffles.They seem to hire pretty friendly staff here. WMD is the best deal but otherwise, if you are looking for only 1/2 toppings at most, the speculoos is highly recommended and I think I've had that before with strawberries or bananas on top also which is good. (if you don't want to buy/eat an entire thing of the slightly less sweet/slightly worse texture wise cookie butter from Trader Joes.I am almost happy their shakes are overpriced because oh my are they delicious.4.2, I'd give it a 5 for a food cart if the prices were lower."
2036,"A waffle with ice cream & Nutella for breakfast.  The kid loved it, I had a couple nibbles, too. Clean & the gal who ran the cart was polite & friendly."
2037,"Everything here is SO good. The wafels are made with a dough, not batter, and it definitely makes all the difference!"
2038,"After walking a quarter way over and back from the Brooklyn Bridge, Kaylen spotted the yellow truck and started nagging me for a snack. She went striaght for the ""de Bom"" just because it had a scoop of icecream on top, didn't matter to her what else comes with the order. ""Mommy, don't forget my strawberries, please please please!"" Alright, damage came out to be $9 and a whole lot of warm sticky goodness smudged all over her face and jacket, priceless. Of course she killed the strawberries (her favorite), left me with a soggy icecream chocolate wafle mess! Well guess what? I still ate it, lol, and boy that waffel was still great. Wafels & Dinges! Would you try to find a way and have your wafels cut into pieces instead? I find myself holding your yummy treats with no tables or seats around and having trouble digging into it!"
2039,I went here for lunch when I was in the city. The waffles were great and the topping was very sweet. The meal was filling. I can recommend it. I plan to go again.
2040,"Awesome waffles!!!!! It was soft, chewy, and caramelized along the exterior.  Cooked to order and drizzled with nutella and fresh strawberries...dusted with powdered sugar.  So simple, yet do decadent!! I am so craving one right now!"
2041,There is no ice cream better then the ones they serve here!! And those waffles are so good I could eat at least 10 in a row
2042,Their waffles are so delicious! I had a waffle with ice cream and chocolate sauce.. awesome. Perfect coupled with my latte. It was a great late night snack in Manhattan when most everything around us was closed. The staff was helpful and service was quick. Great location near to Times Square that had a courtyard nearby that we sat at and ate.
2043,"This is the best wafel I've ever had in my life. Truly, the wafels here are what you always wish your waffles could be like - crisp on the outside, delightfully chewy on the inside, and able to stand up to mounds of gooey toppings without getting soggy.I ordered a turtle-style liege wafel and promptly fell head-over-heels in love. The wafel would be awesome alone or with just a sprinkle of powdered sugar, but the sticky caramel and chocolate sauces complemented the wafel's toasty, buttery flavor and chewy texture really nicely. The toasted walnuts added a nice richness and crunch.In addition, the server was really nice and patiently answered all our silly questions (""What are dinges? Do we get both the wafel and the dinges?"") Honestly, Wafels & Dinges over-delivered. I did not expect so much out of a wafel stand. but my turtle wafel turned out to be one the very best bites I've had in NYC, and now I'm left yearning for a treat that's 200 miles away as I slave over homework. Life's cruel."
2044,"I love liege waffles so I love these trucks. How good the waffles are does depend on the truck and what time you get it. The first time I tried it, a truck was near Amsterdam and 72nd street. The waffles were just made and super fresh. It had such a great texture. The outside was crispy and the inside was nice nad chewy. The second time I had it, a truck was at Union Square. The waffles still tasted good, but you could tell it was made hours before and they just reheated it.The spekuloos ice cream though...so delicious. Had to get another scoop after getting my first."
2045,"Why 4 stars? Because this was a Central Park delight.   ---   ---   ---On my last few hours in NYC, we went on a bike ride through Central Park. I had a long list of places I wanted to eat at, and things I wanted to do during my 3 days in the Large Apple. I had knocked out most of them, but Wafels & Dinges was one of the un-hit spots. And then, boom... it ran into me. Wafels and Dinges found me. It gives me 4-stars for the ability to eat it like it's above average ice cream combined with waffles. Who wouldn't like that?"
2046,"AMBIANCE: usually food stands in the city, so open in public and environment. Great way to watch passerby'sLOCATION: multiple food stands throughout the citySERVICE: quickFOOD: these Belgian waffles are darn good!PRICING:  reasonable price for what you get"
2047,"If you love waffles as much as I do, then wafles & dinges is a must! Toppings/dinges:Bananas, ice cream, strawberries, walnuts, Nutella, maple syrup, whipped cream, dulce de leche, butter, speculoos spread, and Belgian chocolate.Dinges to me means: toppings.1st dinges free, 2nd $1, unlimited $2, & vanilla ice cream scoop +$2. Ordered:* mini wafelini- it definitely true to its name mini. It was small but I was eating so much during my trip that it was a perfect size. It was small but oh so good!!! Made fresh to order. I got mines with the speculoos spread and strawberries. The spread is kinda like cookie butter from trader joes. Delicious!!! Had a light crunch to it. I would highly recommend liege waffle lovers to try wafles & dinges. Although I was so full from eating so many things in NYC, coming here made my experience so much more memorable. Two thumbs up! I'm salivating from just thinking about the warm sweet deliciousness. Fairly priced and staff was nice. Tips:*Accepts MasterCard,VISA, American Express and cash. *It's a little cart. *There's more than one location.*Serves coffee, water, soda, hot cocoa, & tea."
2048,"Soo yummy! Their classic speculoos is a necessity on any waffle! It's expensive though! I do not think whipped cream should count as a topping, it should be standard and free!!"
2049,"This food truck is awesome! The chewy liege waffle thats generously topped with spekuloos is to die for! Spekuloos is a thick, creamy spread made up of gingerbread cookies. The waffle is served somewhat warm with powdered sugar. This delight costs $6 and they accept credit cards for those of you who don't carry cash.  I've never tried anything else but i am sure its also to die for."
2050,"Way better than the Taim in Flatiron, both in terms of quality and quantity. I ordered a salad the other day with the cauliflower shawarma and added on the Mediterranean carrots and kalamata olives. The salad was fantastic, it was a great portion size, and it was dressed well (normally I like my dressing on the side so I can control the amount but luckily I had no complaints there). For somewhere in the realm of $14 it is a little pricey but no more so than sweetgreen so I think it's a comparable alternative. Plus the cauliflower was really amazing.  Haven't tried the falafel from this location yet (one of my biggest complaints about the flatiron location is that the falafel can be very dry) so that'll be the real test, but I was pretty impressed by the salad I got. Will order again."
2051,"Try one of the platters, probably doesn't matter which one, I got the sabich. There's an abundance of vegetable items - pickles, peppers, tabouleh, excellent hummus. The clock is ticking, as the strawberry gazpacho is a summer special. The strawberry was subtle, not the tricked-out fusion I was expecting."
2052,"I always love taim. But today when I have the eggplant pita sandwich at its newer location in flatiron district. My sandwich was so wet and it was very disappointing. Previously Taim tastes like a gourmet hole in the wall type of shop. Now, it tastes like a chain. :(Not worth the premium price."
2053,"Walked past this place on our way uptown. Sure enough - I see a sign for impossible kebab?! I ran inside! My girlfriend and I are both vegetarian and absolutely love plant-based meat(s), especially Impossible/Beyond and for me (recently vegetarian), I always love a good burger, kebab!, especially if it's not actually meat.?! I was skeptical about it... but the Impossible kebab was INCREDIBLE. DELICIOUS. AMAZING. Aside from the modern decor, friendly cashier and staff, and the delicious food, this place is a must. Succulent meat, fresh veggies and hummus! Vegan Mecca"
2054,I really enjoyed Taim. The ingredients are fresh and they have authentic Israeli pita bread. The hummus is also very good and I'd recommend getting a kabob hummus bowl. Very filling and yummy!
2055,"Not many options, not a lot of flavor Honestly a meat cart falafel platter tastes better"
2056,Hands down the best food I've ever had. Literally my favorite thing to eat. The hummus is so amazing and their vegan options make me so happy!
2057,"Yum almost everything is plant-based and delicious I wish I lived closer and could go every day.I went there twice in one weekend, the second time was really an excessive wait time to get my food because supposedly they needed to go get my baklava, but they didn't prepare the other food in the meanwhile either."
2058,"Excellent FoodThe day we visited for lunch, they seemed to have far more orders than they could handle and there were several errors and lots of confusion.  To their credit - and to the credit of the customers - they remained pleasant and sorted through everything to the satisfaction of everyone.  Despite the chaos, the food was excellent and they earned high enough marks to justify return visit(s)."
2059,"DELICIOUS! I got the falafel platter with both types of falafel (still the same price), and it blew my mind.First off: the most important part of the platter: the hummus. It has a smooth texture that is moistened by a little bit of oil and some spice that I can't figure out what. It complements the whole platter.Secondly: the falafel - I honestly can't distinguish the taste between the two - they're equally as yummy, but it tastes amazing with the hummus. The salad on the side with some quinoa was so good!!! It helped to freshen up my palate and make the whole platter itself complete with some veggies. It's a little pricey for $14, but this can definitely feed two (if you have a moderate sized appetite). Will definitely come back again to try out other dishes they have!"
2060,"So good! I got the hummus/couscous bowl with green falafel. So fresh, delicious, and healthy. The prices were also great. I'll be back!"
2061,"We've been getting Taim delivered, and they are always consistent. I tried the mezze platter for the first tome and thought it was good, but will stick to the falafel salad (my favorite). The mint lemonade and baklava are also amazing."
2062,"A solid spot for inexpensive Middle Eastern fare. Their core options include falafel or veggies served inside a pita, as part of a salad, or as part of a platter. There's also mezze that you can order individually or as a side.I chose the ""mezze-terranean"" pita (hummus, marinated beets, Moroccan carrots, tahini, parsley) and a side of falafel and found it to be a very filling and nourishing meal served super fast.There are only half a dozen counter seats packed tightly into this tiny venue, so most folks get their grub to go. Still, a super option to have if you live in the area or are passing through."
2063,This place came HIGHLY recommended by a friend of mines and although I've seen it in passing i was never really into falafels to give it a chance. Plus it's pretty small and ALWAYS busy and crowded (which is a good sign right?) Have to say... I was VERY impressed with my food. I came by for lunch and ordered the green falafel with the works in a pita bread along with some fries with both sauces. In a nutshell I will be back!! Falafels were DELICIOUS!!! So good!! The both sauces that came with the fries are amazing. Was definitely glad that I got them both! Liked the saffron aioli best!! My stomach was full and I was a happy person full of energy afterwards. I will definitely be returning!
2064,"I ordered the sabich in a pita with safron aioli fries.The pita was thick, warm and soft. The combination of ingredients felt like a passionate summer love affair of vegetables with the perfectly cooked eggplant melting in my mouth. The warm pita bread hugs the vegetables nicely and the tahini sauce hits the tongue like a gentle summer breeze. The slice boiled egg is a nice touch to the flavor of this super scrumptious pita. It will leave you missing your summer flame even in the dead of the winter.The saffron aioli is gentle but lively. I really enjoyed this meal! I will definitely come back to try other dishes on the menu! Highly recommended."
2065,"Great Food and Sometimes great service... but usually horrible service and absolutely no response from management.The staff seems to turn over weekly if not more frequently.  Some are amazing, most seem to be overwhelmed and undertrained.  It is very disappointing to get home with your take out order and find something major missing and then having to go back for it. But even more disappointing is that they don't answer their phone so you can ask them to make the missing item while you make the trip back to the store, and when you get to the store they tell you that didn't order the item despite that it appears on the email receipt they sent.  Another time, when i was the only person waiting for food, and they called out for ""John""  I asked if the order contained the things i ordered and all they could say is ""are you John"" which i am not, and it goes back and forth like that until they say yes, it has those exact things in this order, just take it! Should I keep going?  You can't make this stuff up! The only reason why i return is because the food is really good.  But since management ignored what I feel were useful comments I will have to express my dissatisfaction directly to staff by not tipping them anymore.  I think this is a particularly mean thing to do when so many are struggling but i feel it is managements fault for not responding to a single note i have written to them, not even with a empty canned response."
2066,Was looking forward to trying this place. Unfortunately the sight of the maskless employees inside preparing the food and taking orders deterred me from doing so. It's a very basic courtesy to the customers that most restaurants abide by during this awful pandemic but this place unfortunately doesn't.
2067,"I would give it 4.5 stars if I could, but only giving 4 rather than 5 because it's not the best Mediterranean food I have ever had. Definitely up there, though. Came here about a month ago and there was no indoor seating due to COVID but the 2 tables outside were nice. I got a bowl with cumin rice, falafel, pickles, pickled onions, shifka peppers, and the spicy Yemenite sauce. It was super flavorful, the falafel wasn't dry, and it all blended well together. In short, I would recommend this place to others, would come back again, and would even go out of my way to come back here."
2068,I love Taim for a quick healthy meal! I go about once a week at this point. Their harissa falafel is so tasty and they give you a good amount. Most ingredients are gluten free. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that the food is never ready on time when I order ahead (or takes a while when I order there) and they usually forget something or give me the wrong thing. I don't blame them because they seem understaffed and it's a small enough place where they can't have a large staff.
2069,Taim hit a home run for me a couple weeks ago. Thanks for the lovely service and seriously delicious food. The hummus makes me feel like I'm home.Love that it's vegan-vegetarian as well. Can't wait to come back for more! Gonna remember to take home double the hummus next time.
2070,"Small (tiny) takeout place in the heart of the West Village, with the most delicious food. Can not recommend enough!"
2071,"I came here for dinner with a friend as we wanted somewhere quick and delicious. We came here on a weekday evening and since the seating area was limited, we took our food to Union Square and ate in the park.I ordered the red spicy falafel salad. My friend ordered the cauliflower pita. There are a plethora of vegetarian dishes so come hungry vegan friends! The food kept well during our rather long walk out, much to our delight. My salad was delicious, well dressed, and had a good amount of falafel in it. The falafel itself was delicious, crispy, and light with a great amount of spice level. My friend really enjoyed her cauliflower pita as well.Overall, really great Mediterranean fare that is very reasonably priced. The prices are under 10$ which is an absolute steal in a city full of overpriced food."
2072,"Consistently the best falafel, hummus, and pita in NYC. Their fries with unique dipping sauces are also insanely good. Great option if you or the people you're with are vegan!"
2073,"I really enjoyed my platter here! I got the cauliflower schwarma because I wanted something a bit healthier than fried falafel (not to say these aren't absolutely delicious). What I loved about the cauliflower was that they kept the integrity of the cauliflower by using it in its full form and not grinding it up. The cauliflower took on all the flavor of the schwarma seasoning and held its own as the main star of the dish. The hummus and tahini, shepherds salad, onions, tabouleh, warm pita, and cabbage salad that came with the dish really made it a filling meal. No meat was missed in this dish! It took me right back to the Israeli street food I know and love. I would definitely give this place a visit and there are multiple locations in Manhattan!"
2074,"Really tasty food. Tiny place, so take out might be a better idea. I got the cauliflower shawarma"
2075,"Long of the short, I thoroughly enjoy this hole in the wall spot in the village. Ive been going to Taim for years and have never had a bad meal. Everything is fresh, quick and responsibly priced. The staff is always pleasant and efficient. The falafel and hummus' are key in my opinion. I enjoy the pita bread and tomato salad. But everything is worth the try. Next visit I'll order the baklava. This spot is hidden by building/street construction but not hard to find. Street parking is available and there are many subway options nearby. One con: There is a leaky AC unit outside the door which will spray every patron that opens it."
2076,"This tiny tiny restaurant packs a powerful punch! Taim is simply the best vegan friendly, falafel sandwich making restaurant in all of NYC. Their food is consistently savory and delicious. We love this brand and what they're trying to do - provide hungry people with healthier (and very delicious) food options. We hit this location up in the West Village almost daily during our recent stay in NYC. We're longtime fans of this place and make a point of going here every chance we get.I honestly can't recommend this place any higher! Go get some of these falafels, you'll be glad you did."
2077,"3.5 stars. Nothing bad to say, but after having some outstanding falafel from other places around the area I just can't say this is up there with them in comparison. I got a pita sandwich this afternoon with a mix of the green and harissa falafel. It was good, but I think the hummus and falafel could have had more flavor and/or seasoning."
2078,"The falafels were delicious here and you get your choice of falafel balls. I wasn't a big fan of the green one as it tasted a bit heavy on cilantro but my boyfriend loved it for the same reason so it's all down to preference. We also got fries with the two sauces, one a ketchup and the other an aioli. I particularly liked the aioli as it had a nice flavorful kick to it from the saffron."
2079,"I really enjoyed my falafel sandwich here! The location is extremely small so you sit at a counter or you take it to go. The falafel here is very moist and smaller so it's easier to bite into. As soon as I took my first bite, I thought that it was such a delicious falafel. I felt that the pricing was fair and each bite was filled with a different flavor of mint. I really enjoyed this. I saw the baklava ($3) and I was tempted! Looked delicious!"
2080,"Love sitting at one of their outdoor tables sipping a lemon verbena tea and nibbling on a chocolate hazelnut brunette, rose croissant or pain au chocolat, watching people stroll by on Madison Ave.  My husband loves their gigantic palmier cookies!  Service is very friendly and professional albeit it may take them several minutes (8-10 minutes to make tea) to prepare your beverage. If you have time to relax however, this is the best cafe to enjoy at leisure.  It has the best pastries and sure beats the long lines and fashion influencers jockeying for a table at Ralph's Coffee (as in Ralph Lauren) around the corner on 72nd St.  Laduree is our go-to rest stop on the UES."
2081,"Beautiful shop! Feels very decadent and fancy and the display is gorgeous. Great service. There are a few tables inside but even more outside. It's not wait service, you seat yourself. The espresso is amazing, and they offer different milks for any type of dietary need. The macarons are what to get, though the other desserts were very good as well. Not the least expensive place, but it's a special treat for yourself or special occasion."
2082,"I was so excited to check this place out. The place is very cute, looks like something in Paris! I was sort of disappointed in the macarons, though. They weren't anything special. The floral ones were overly floral. The texture wasn't spectacular. Everything in there is gorgeous, though!"
2083,"I love Laduree macroons. This location is in a more touristy area so it tends to be very busy, but the team moves people along quickly. There is a small area for indoor dining, but usually it's full, so I've only gotten to-go from this location."
2084,"No one can deny Laduree macarons are truly amazing. I came on a Saturday afternoon to pickup a box of macarons, and there was about a 15min line outside.Once I got in, the person serving me was very helpful and polite. I chose a box of 6 macarons - 2 each of the caramel, raspberry, and passion fruit. Passion fruit was definitely the best! It has a super intense passion fruit flavor, and I really recommend. I thought the caramel was a close second. I also tried the macaron filled with fresh raspberries and rose cream which was delicious.By the time I got their around 4pm, they had run out of pastries. If that's what you're looking for, I suggest stopping in earlier in the day."
2085,These pastries are super fresh. Very authentic macaroons with fun flavors like passion fruit and earl grey. The eclair was very vibrant in color with dried strawberry topping. I definitely will come back to try more of their macaroons and possibly give them to friends/family as gifts.
2086,"Came here around 10:40AM on Saturday. During the pandemic they are only allowing 6 customers into the store at a time. There were only two people in front of me, outside the store. A line of about 6-8 slowly formed behind me.  We ordered 5 macarons: citron, fleur d'Oranger, Marie Antoinette, café, and fruit de la passion. Coffee (café) was my favorite. The filling tasted like coffee ice cream. Citron was a delicious lemon macaron. The passion fruit was okay.  I did not like the orange blossom macaron, too floral for me. The Marie Antoinette was my least favorite- the flavors were odd. I like that the macarons were soft with a little chewiness. They were not overly sweet like most macarons I've tried at other places."
2087,"Came on a Sunday morning at 9:30. So relaxing and quiet. A couple of people were there but half the seats were empty - perfect. My favorite croissants. Have tried croissants from a number of places in the city, but these are some of the best. Highly recommend their rose croissant, which has a very light rose flavor and is very lightly sweetened. Perfect. Still tastes like a croissant and is not overpowered by rose flavors. Also tried their pain au chocolat (good), Parisian sandwich (really good turkey and cheese, and quite filling), and quiche Lorraine (good, but greasy). Their coffee is not bad as well. Didn't like the cannale or the brunette."
2088,This place has really good Macarons. I thought that their hot chocolate was fine but it wasn't great.
2089,"OMG I love this place is so cute  I love the macaroons, specially pistachio and coffee are the best I've ever tasted! And obviously i recommend this for gossip girl fans"
2090,"This a Michelin star Japanese restaurant 3 years running. Reservations via Resy are highly recommended. The richness and authenticity of the the ramen here definitely helps Tonchin earn its rating. My friend and I ordered the bites sampler which included the crispy garlic salt shishito, zesty tonchin tonchin cucumber and the vegan oyster mushroom. The crispy fried garlic with the lightly grilled shishito was perfect. Great textures and extra crunch in every bite made it delicious. If you love cucumbers and mushrooms definitely order this sampler. My friend and I ordered the classic Tonkotsu and the miso ginger ramen. The Tonkotsu broth was perfect with the right amount of balance, flavor and salt. The roasted cha-shu pork was thinly sliced and perfect with each spoonful of broth. The vegetarian miso ginger broth packed a lot heat. Beware if you can't handle the spicy level you'll be sweating the whole night. We really enjoyed our experience here. Flavors are on point and even with the Michelin star you won't be breaking the bank. Expect a 60-90 minute way on prime busy weekend evenings. I will definitely be back to try some of their cocktails and other ramen broths."
2091,"Nothing but amazing things to say about Tonchin! My sister has been raving about this place forever, so on our trip to NYC we made it a point to stop here and were totally impressed.We came when they opened at 5:30 and there was a 45 minute wait (and it was WELL worth it!). Our server was prompt and friendly, and able to answer all of our questions. We warmed up with some oolong tea while we waited for our chicken and pork bao buns (OFF the chain). For our entrees we both had the tonkatsu Tokyo ramen. I am not lying when I say this was the BEST ramen I've ever had in my life. Rich, flavorful, hearty, and just delicious. And a very generous portion! Prices are fair, food is authentic and quality, ambience is so neat, and service is fantastic. We will definitely be back at Tonchin on our next visit to the city!"
2092,"The ramen game is strong, rich and flavorful without going overboard, and the char shu is actually still meaty, unlike other places that prefer to cook it til it falls apart.Friends loved the make-your-own hand rolls, and the unagi rice is less like a roll and more like a log (or a musubi) you gotta finish wrapping yourself.It's very pretty, both in terms of food and decor, especially if you sit in the booths, which are accessible, understated dark painted wood. The bigger tables have a bit more of an industrial vibe, in the tall, concrete cavern that Tonchin occupies.One of the better choices in Manhattan."
2093,"Tonchin has nice ambience, I do think the food fell a bit short of expectations though. I got a clam ramen, which was better than it sounded, but not as great as I would have expected from a restaurant with Tonchin's rep. It was a bit too salty for me personally, but my friend's Tokyo ramen was even saltier. I would probably choose another ramen place over this one, if you're prioritizing good food over vibes."
2094,"4.5/5! this is definitely one of the best ramen restaurants I've been to!!! The tan tan ramen was delicious and rich in flavor, nice balance of spicy and savory. We also ordered the prime beef rice ball and edamame. The edamame was amazing and seasoned perfectly, glad I ordered it. I wasn't a huge fan of the prime beef rice ball sadlyWe waited around 30 minutes as a walk in for two on a busy Monday afternoon. Service was fast, and the ambience was beautiful. I definitely want to come back here to try the buns and shaved ice!!"
2095,"I came to Tonchin for a Saturday lunch with a group of friends (6). We didn't have a reservation so we put our names down at the front. The wait was about an hour and we got outdoor seating. Everything was pretty seamless for the process. I would either suggest coming earlier to put your name down or try to reserve beforehand. The place gets pretty busy, granted it was really good, so to make the most of your time-plan ahead!I got the Tokyo Tonkotsu Ramen. 9 times out of 10 I prefer a miso or soy broth but Tonchin is known for their Tonkotsu broths so I had to try it. I was really blow away. If it's a Tonchin Tonkotsu broth, I would 9 out of 10 times order that over my regular preferences. The broth is much lighter than other Tonkotsu broths I've tried without skimping on the flavor the pork gives. It's a very nice feeling where you don't feel weighted down, which I often feel after heavier broths. The noodles were bouncy and chewy. The thin slices of pork were nicely salted. Overall, I was extremely happy with my meal at Tonchin! The *broth* is the secret sauce! I would recommend it to any ramen lover in the city."
2096,"The best veggie ramen I've had in the city hands down!! The mock meat is so flavorful, and it's loaded with delicious veggies. I was so full but couldn't stop eating. Great service and clean, simple, but sophisticated restaurant aesthetic. I came here while my sister was visiting me and she can't stop talking about how good the ramen was. Wish we'd had space to try the shaved ice, which seemed very popular, but can't wait to come back and try it."
2097,Solid food and great ambiance! I've wanted to try Tonchin for awhile and it didn't disappoint. The mushrooms in the rice roll tasted a little undercooked and doughy. The chicken wings were great and the ramen was solid too. I really liked the strawberry kakigori! Overall would recommend!
2098,"Absolutely delicious ramen!My coworkers and I were looking for a lunch spot that had vegan options and I stumbled across Tonchin!My coworkers ordered the Tonchin Classic Tokyo Tonkatsu Ramen and the Smoked Dashi Ramen and I had the Miso Ginger Ramen (vegan). Everything was amazing! So much flavor, chewy noodles, and awesome toppings.I'll definitely be back!"
2099,"Tonchin was everything I could have hoped for; the kind of meal you dream that New York can offer. I was lucky enough to experience it with my parents this past weekend. It was easy enough to make lunch reservations day of, but dinner was totally booked up. It worked out because I ate so much I didn't need to eat dinner. The space is gorgeous: simple, elegant, elevated Japanese. I immediately spotted the high ball machine: a machine made by Suntory to ensure the perfect high ball every time. It came in a Suntory mug just like Japan. We started with the Bites Sampler and chose the Shishito peppers, Ban Ban chicken, and Pickled Cucumbers. All three were excellent, though the Shishitos and Chicken both had a lovely spiciness that I particularly enjoyed. Tonchin offers a lunch special where you can pair your ramen with a side: I tried the Beef rice ball and my dad had the salad (both were amazing). The rice ball is more like a rectangle that you fold over and eat lengthwise like a sandwich. You get lots of filling in each bite this way. For the ramen I chose the Tsukemen which allowed me to dip the noodles and toppings at my leisure. The broth was a Tonkotsu broth that was made even better by the side of spicy beef that you can add. The noodles were PERFECTION. It seems I'm always searching for THESE specific noodles and Tonchin has them. Springy, slightly sticky, medium thickness. I also love that they include all the toppings you'd want instead of having to order them ala carte. The chashu is thinly sliced and gets cooked slightly in the warm broth like shabu shabu. Everything was seriously so good I can't wait to come back. I know there's a lot of good ramen in NYC but it's hard to imagine topping Tonchin."
2100,Some of the best ramen I have had in New York! Lots of indoor seating and the wait wasn't too long for a walk in on Sunday evening. Portions were decently sized. It was kind of dim and loud but overall a nice place to go with small groups
2101,"Omg yum. Go, you won't regret it. I think this is my favorite ramen place in NYC. The restaurant is fairly small so I'd recommend making a reservation. I don't come to these places expecting great service, but our server was incredibly friendly and the service was impeccable. Casual, simplistic, cool ambiance. As far as food goes, definitely save room for the ramen because that's the star of the show, but their apps are insanely delicious. I ordered the below (apps were split between 4 people):-Edamame: this might have been my favorite app. It was so surprising flavor-wise and I don't know how I'll ever eat regular edamame with regular salt ever again. -Shoestring Potato: yum! Extremely thin cut and crunchy. -Tonchin Chicken Tsukune: essentially a bao bun. This was delicious! -Pan Fried Gyoza: literally comes in a sizzling skillet. These were good, but my least favorite app because the only dipping sauce is an extremely spicy chili oil. It was too spicy for me.-Chashu Rice Ball: loved this too! It's not an actual rice ball, it's more in the shape of spam musubi with the chashu on top of the rice. -Classic Tonkatsu Ramen: delicious! Perfect noodle texture. Perfectly rich salty broth. -Matcha Shaved Ice: this is huge. Definitely recommend sharing. It comes with a dollop of cream on top and red beans underneath. This was really refreshing after the ramen and the matcha flavor is mild - not too earthy tasting which I liked. -Seasonal Cheesecake: we definitely could've done without this. It was good, but shaved ice was the way to go because it's lighter and more refreshing."
2102,"So good!! Always looking for good authentic ramen.  Found it here. We made reservations for a noon lunch on a Monday. We were seated at a nice booth and the place filled up quickly.  Being NYC, vaccine cards and ID are required.  Service was great, the food was great. My tan tanmem looked like it was going to be pretty spicy, but it was just right. The chasu pork was so tender, the noodles perfectly cooked as well as the egg and it came out piping hot.  I always know it was a good bowl of ramen when I'm sad that the eating experience is over!!Michelin rated."
2103,"High quality ramen shop!Dropped by during weekday, luckily they provided me with a walk-in spot!Noodles are under super good quality! Soup is really rich and tasty! I tried the dipped noodle, so impressive!"
2104,"Tokyo ramen is a medium bowl of comforting goodness, somehow not too heavy and easily able to try the range of appetizers too. Tantan spicy ramen has the most interesting kick though, and will warm your chilled bones. The matcha shaved ice is as it is, good but not anymore or less than Grace street. The maguro tartar is done in the style of beef tartar but with korean spices and nori lettuce wraps- fun and light. Fried fish bun is is a bit of a messy eat with the tarter sauce and spicy mayo"
2105,I was really excited to try Michelin star ramen and this place didn't disappoint! Service was excellent and the vibes were great. My friends and I shared two ban ban chickens. I recommend getting two if you're going to share since it's quite small. I got the spicy tan tan ramen and it was great. I also tried my friend's classic ramen and the broth was so good! I'll get that next time!
2106,"Ooh this was a tough place to review only because there are SO many ramen restaurants in NYC.  But moreso, Tonchin NYC is Michelin star rated.  I came here as it was one of the closer ramen places to where my friend lives, and I just so happened to be lucky enough to be staying at his place during my return trip to NYC.  We BOTH got the lunch special ramen set, and he added more charsiu pork to his.  In addition, we also went for the parmesan wings because we both LOVE wings.Wings:PROS:- fantastic amount. Definitely shareable.- great flavor- NOT DRY- generous with the cheese!CONS:- none""Taco"" - you can choose from a variety of tacos.  The taco shell is actually a steamed bun, similar to that you would find for Peking Duck. Some places may call it a ""mantou wrapper"".PROS:- very nice and soft, came out warm- good amount of stuffing to wrapper ratioCONS: - a bit too much sauce for my personal taste, but it tasted good!Ramen (tonkatsu) - I got tonkatsu, my friend I think got the dan dan ramen.PROS:- great quantity (it's pretty big)- nice amount of toppings (meat, vegetable, to other addons)- good amount of noodles to soup (some places don't give that much and others give TOO much noodle).- meat was definitely sufficient, enough where my friend said he wished he didn't get the extra charsiu on the side because it was too much.- reheats well (because I definitely could not finish).CONS:- none.It is a really nice place to get lunch.  The decoration is great, and the service is also good.  Is it ""Michelin"" worthy? I'm not sure. I suppose if it was Bib Gourmand then maybe! But I'm not sure what would constitute a ""Michelin star"" ramen restaurant.  Ramen is just such a day-to-day thing, esp in Asia where it's like a dime a dozen.  It's really really good don't get me wrong, but just super hard to judge what would make it Michelin worthy.  Would I come back? oh for sure. It's great ramen.  It's closer and probably easier to get a seat than some of the other ramen establishments in the area too."
2107,"Tonchin is currently my favorite ramen place in the city HANDS DOWN.I love the vibes (cute open kitchen concept and minimalist decor) and I love the menu - everything from the ramen to the apps to cocktails. I'm not exaggerating when I say I found this place serendipitously for a friend's birthday and proceeded to come back 3 more times over the next 1.5 months. I just couldn't get enough and wanted to try more of their menu!For the apps, I love the eel hand roll and I also think the curry cheese chicken is really unique. I like how it's a grated cheese rather than the melty kind, which can be a bit overwhelming somethings. For ramen, I alternate between getting the tan tan ramen (love) and the smoked dashi (also love). I love dashi broth in general so adding the smoky flavor to it makes it one of the more unique but still homey ramens I've had. I did notice there aren't many vegetarian/non-park options which is a little disappointing so maybe they could work on that. Another thing to note that it can get pretty hard to get a table here! I would definitely make a res ahead of time. I've tried to walk in multiple times for lunch and dinner and have had varying success. That's just the price you pay for good ramen.Overall, still a 5 stars for me and I'll be coming back again and again and again and again....and again!!"
2108,"One of my favorite Japanese spots in town.We ordered one of each bun to start and the spicy chicken wings. Although i enjoyed my ramen and the dry rub of the chicken, I have to say my favorite thing we ordered here were the buns. Specifically, my favorite was the Fried Fish and Spicy Mayo bun. It was like an elevated fish fillet.They specialize in tonkotsu ramen, and it's great here, so don't kid yourself trying to get anything to substitute it.I also liked that we were able to customize order quantities since we had an odd group number (i.e. get an order of 3 baos instead of the listed 2). Our waiter also let us try out a bottle of sake before committing to it, which we really appreciated.This meal will sneak up on you and put you in a coma if you're not careful, so don't order more than you need!"
2109,"I came here on a Sunday for lunch and the queue was quite long: I would recommend grabbing a reservation ahead of time. It took about 45 minutes for bar seating for a table for two at the bar. They have large tables in the back, but personally I quite liked sitting at the bar. The interior decor is stunning and they had an outdoor seating area which I believe is closed for the winter. I ordered the Tonchin Classic Tokyo Tonkatsu Ramen. The broth was perfect, not too salty and it paired wonderfully with the chashu and the noodles. Probably one of the best bowls of ramen that I've had in NYC."
2110,"I came here on a Friday for lunch around 1pm and luckily they had a table for two available, I was worried there might not be any tables open since we hadn't made a reservation in advance.With the weather cooling down in NY, it's perfect for ramen! I was excited to try Tonchin especially with all the recognition they have received. I ordered the classic tonkotsu ramen, it's my go-to to try at all ramen places. The chasu meat was cooked well and it had nice flavor to it. It also came with seaweed, bamboo shoots, green onion and half an egg. The egg was maybe medium-boiled, it didn't have a runny yolk though. I thought the noodles were average. I did enjoy the broth, I liked that it didn't taste too heavy or greasy, it had nice flavor to it but I wouldn't say it's the most amazing ramen I've ever had - however it's a good bowl of ramen and it was very satisfying on a cold day."
2111,"First time here, the food quality is up to par. I understand what the hype is about. We didn't make reservations and it was a 1 hour wait which wasn't so bad for us since we just went next door to get drinks and wait til it was our turn. The ramen was delicious, rich and flavorful something you wouldn't want to miss out on while you're here. I have no regrets coming here. Must try spot!"
2112,"Tonchin makes their noodles in house, and they are the platonic ideal of ramen noodles: wavy and chewy. I went a little rogue and got the Smoked Dashi Ramen instead of the Classic Tokyo. The smoked fish oil definitely adds an umami punch to the broth, but I must say clams are no substitute for roasted cha-shu. Speaking of which, the cha-shu at Tonchin is considerably leaner than the melt-in-your-mouth pork belly at many other ramen restaurants, but it is plenty flavorful. The bamboo shoots were rather chewy and perhaps stole too much of the ramen show in our bowls (my boyfriend got the Spicy Tan Tan Ramen). All in all, it cured the winter blues, and I would definitely come back. Instead of ordering apps, we split the Coffee Milk Shaved Ice which was very satisfying after a fiery bowl of noodles. It took an incredibly long time to come out, though, probably as long as it took for us to devour our noodles."
2113,"We didn't make reservations and they gave us estimated time of 45 minutes. But it really took like 30 minutes for two people during a weekday lunchtime. So avoid our mistake and make reservation if you don't want to wait, especially in the cold. They do have benches inside to let people sit but it probably allows 8 people total to sit. The waiting area isn't big either. They also check for COVID vaccine status and your ID. They take your number and  they send you a text message when the table is ready, which they'll hold for 10 minutes, so don't go too far.My GF got the smoked dashi ramen and I got the spicy miso. I would say that the spicy miso is good but the broth I felt like the was so rich and creamy that my ramen was soaked in sauce more than broth. I also felt like the spiciness of the broth overpowered the miso flavor in the bowl. The noodles were bouncy and chewy in both the spicy miso and smoked dashi. My GF's smoked dashi was definitely the favorite for the both of us as it had a ton of flavor and fragrance. The broth in the smoked dashi was definitely delightful as it was nothing like the spicy miso. It was actually broth vs. a sauce. We basically came here for the experience and now that we got it we most likely won't return as we do think it is on the pricer side and we can find ramen elsewhere in NYC that is more tasty and cheaper."
2114,OMG best ramen EVER!!!!I'm vegetarian and always tried to find a good ramen place until i got here.Since i came back to MD I cannot find other place like this. I will definitely come back for more!
2115,"Everything was amazing and surpassed expectations... EVERYTHINGThe salad was so juicy and it had the best light dressing ever. This salad is actually a must have and it would be a loss to have gone to Tonchin and missed out on this salad. I promise you won't regret.The chicken buns were the best bao buns I've ever had in my life. Wayyy better than pork belly. Never thought I'd say that.The dashi ramen is a must try but it's a lot of flavor. If possible I would get one for the table to share. They earned their Michelin star because of this dish so you haveeeee to get it. The classic ramen is also good.The shishito peppers are way better than average and the garlic gives it a surprising texture and flavor. Even though the dish is amazing, I could have done without it.All in all amazing!!! Run don't walk to this ramen spot!"
2116,"Insane ramen. We got the shishito peppers, shoestring fries, and ban ban chicken for starters all of which were great. I got the spicy tan tan tonkotsu ramen which was honestly the best ramen I've ever had. Service was great too just be sure to make a reservation as wait times are long."
2117,"I was really craving Japanese Ramen in the area, and found this place walking distance! I walked in and was surprised that this place was a Michelin starred restaurant. I came alone and was seated right away. There was the bar area for seating, but also the communal table where other people who came alone can sit together in one big table! Service was great and they were all very attentive. I thought the broth was a bit salty, but the noodles were the perfect texture. I would love to come back and try their other dishes and drinks (did not order because I knew I wouldn't be able to finish them by myself)! The ambiance was also nice with modern looking tables."
2118,"Midtown NYC prices at this ramen joint, but gosh darnit the flavors are very good. 'Joint' is not really the most accurate descriptor for the ambiance of the space though-- more like chic, sleek, and capacious, at least, for a ramen restaurant in Midtown. I'd guess the whole restaurant seats about 30-40, with a large 6 top in the back, lots of booth seating on the side of the restaurant and a little window into the bustling happenings of the kitchen in the back. The menu is fun, and full of options for vegans, pescatarians, and our more carnivorous friends to enjoy. Come with a group so you can try more of their menu and share a big ol' kakigori shaved ice dessert at the end.As a non-pork eater, ramen is not often catered to my palate, and I often eye veggie broths warily because they lack depth of flavor. Not here at Tonchin. The miso ginger ramen, which is vegan, even uses homemade vegan noodles and is full of immense depth of flavor that has me drinking up every last drop each time. The spicy cabbage, soy protein, menma, wakame, sesame, scallion and chilli pepper also give it nice texture and aromatics that make this a very solid and filling bowl of noodles. In the summer, I opt for a bowl of the brothless mazemen summer noodles in the mushroom version. It is genuinely as satisfying as any noodle dish with animal proteins I've ever had. I eat eggs and like to add a soft boiled one to my bowl for a bit of protein.If you have the appetite, try some of their unique appetizers, including the fried fish and spicy miso buns, and the potato salad with snow crab. The latter is very fresh and flavorful, and satisfying to eat. What really rounds out the journey for your tastebuds at Tonchin is one (or three) of their large and amazing kakigori shaved ice desserts. You can choose from flavors like mango, strawberry, coffee, or matcha. I've had the fortune of trying them all and can say they're all amazing, and even more fun when shared with some friends. It's a huge mound of evenly shaved ice with syrup and fruit poured on top. Totally refreshing anytime of year.Service is great and they keep the dishes cranking, I've never had to wait too long to be served or for the food to arrive at the table. Impress a date, a client, or some friends here or take yourself out. No one will be mad at the experience here."
2119,"Ramen was great blend of spicy and savory, rich broth. Noodles chewy and delicious Great appetizers Great serviceReally enjoyed the food, would come again"
2120,"I'll be honest, tonchin was my plan B since ichiran's line was 30 people deep right after it opened and I'm really really glad it worked out the way it did!!! Hands down my experience at tonchin was way better than ichiran from what I recall!The menu was overwhelming for someone who just wanted ramen and I decided on the smoked dashi ramen with an oz of hesitation bc I have no idea what it would taste like but it was the most intriguing of the bunch! For w.e reason, they said it would take a while to prepare and I was totally fine with waiting, Plus I had no idea what else to get on the menu. My ramen came after mayb max 10-15 mins and o man it looked good! Not as colorful as the tan tan which I saw a lot of people get but the moment I tried the soup, I was blown away! Wow it packs so much flavor! And the ""smokiness"" of it was completely different than what I had imagined! Very tasty!! Esp if u like it savory with the taste of seafood! And very unique compared to the ubiquitous tonkotsu ramen! I'm definitely looking to return to try their other dishes! Great find in nyc!"
2121,"Enjoyed a hearty bowl of ramen after a crappy, rainy  morning walking through Manhattan. This was our first time coming to this restaurant and loved the ambiance and design. It was a clean, modern, and open space. We started off with the curry cheese wings and ordered the Tokyo ramen while my husband ordered the tan tan ramen. I can't decide if I liked the wings, but they were interesting for sure. The broth from my ramen was light, not overly salty but full of flavor and well balanced. I loved that the pork was thinly sliced! The tan tan ramen was the right amount of spicy but definitely builds up with each bite so beware. The whole experience was a great time, wish we had a bigger group to order more appetizers and dessert!"
2122,"I've been craving some good ramen for some time, and this place really hit the spot.  I was very glad to see this place on Resy, makes the whole experience a lot less stressful.  I was seated on time, but it was very busy during lunch.  I ended up going with the Smoked Dashi Ramen which sounded very unique.  This ramen did not disappoint, it had a great smoky flavor that wasn't too overpowering.  It blended really well with the rich dashi flavor.  This ramen was on the richer side overall.  It was very addictive.  I would also recommend getting one of their signature cocktails too while you're here.  I was tempted to get some dessert but was way too full.  I'll have to return to try their shaved ice!"
2123,"Tonchin just might be my new favorite ramen spot in New York. We had a reservation on a Thursday night at 5pm before a show at Walter Kerr Theater at 7pm. It was just enough time for some cocktails and dinner before the show. We started off with some cocktails - Japanese Old Fashioned, Green Yuzu Margarita, Pisco Sour, Rosemary 75. Each drink was strong and beautifully crafted! I tried the Spicy Tan Tan Ramen which came with tonkotsu broth, chashu pork, egg, scallion, menma, miso and chili powder. The housemade noodles were perfect and the broth was tasty. My friends got the Tonchin Classic Tonkotsu Ramen and I thought this broth was out of this world! Served with chashu pork, egg, scallion and menma. I am definitely ordering this dish on my next visit."
2124,"First bite of their classic ramen's chashu, I had to look up the menu again to confirm what I was eating is what I thought it was.The meat was the most tender chashu I've ever had and it was amazingly delicious.Arriving in NYC late by train , they were one of the few restaurants open late.They had a community table and since I was coming in alone, they seated me there.Menu is available from their QR code.I came here only because they were still open when I arrived. I didn't know anything about this place.Classic ramen was beyond my expectations and I was very happy with the quality of ramen here.A customer sat across from me had gyoza. It looked so good, I thought about asking him if I could had one... no I didn't ask... I thought about ordering gyoza for myself but I didn't eat that much late at night.I need to come back here to eat their gyoza. When can I come back????"
2125,We want to try this Tonchin Ramen because it's rated a Michelin restaurant.  I love the atmosphere very cozy and the kitchen looks amazing. The ramen was delicious.
2126,loved this place! the umami flavor of the tsukemen broth was incredible - the perfect amount of saltiness. the portion size was good for the price - we felt like the noodle for the tsukemen was never ending haha. the unagi rice roll wasn't my favorite because it had ginger on it but the unagi was really great. the spicy wings weren't the type of spice i expected because it had more pepper taste than spice but i really enjoyed it. the matcha shaved ice was amazing - you can really tell that they used quality matcha. i also loved their take on banana pudding. no wonder why they're michelin star for three years! cant wait to go back for the tsukemen and the other desserts :)[food insta: @strwbrrryboba :)]
2127,"My wife and I really liked the spicy wings,  it quite spicy but something about that stuff rub, unique (numbing hot) sensation.The spicy tan tan ramen was my favorite, can't go wrong with a spicy creamy ramen broth. Felt like spicy miso ramen to me. Regardless, it was the perfect bowl of noodles with the right amount of cha-shu and toppings for each slurp. The cha shu is sliced super thin and rather lean which I loved!"
2128,"What a fantastic experience. The ambience, the service, the flavors will blow you away. This is a Michelin starred ramen restaurant , one of the few at a decent price point with a hip, clean ambience and attentive and kind service. Highly recommend making a reservation! I'll begin by saying up front that I'm not necessarily the biggest ramen expert but can appreciate a good handmade noodle. I opted for the summer noodle and tried one of their gin drinks, but the real star of the show were the spicy wings. I've quite literally never had anything as crispy and flavorful in wing form before- Tonchin does it right! Aside from that, the summer noodles, which are served cold and in a sesame sauce, are tasty and light while still being filling. I tried a sip of the classic ramen and thought the flavor profile was good but again, I'm not picky about my ramen. For dessert, we shared a mango shaved ice which was a refreshing end to the meal; I've had just as good shaved ice before at lower price point but the fresh cream on the ice highlighted the dessert and gave it an extra oomph. For a Michelin star restaurant, I'd definitely say prices here are on the lower end for a Manhattan restaurant (always a win)! All in all, the ambience, food (cough cough the wings), and service make this a highly recommend spot for me!"
2129,"The first time I came here was probably my best experience. The spicy wings were delicious and the classic ramen was so flavorful (best broth I've had). The next time I came, I tried the spicy tan tan ramen and it was not great so I went back to what I know and got the classic again. Tip: Try getting a reservation ahead of time. The wait can be quite long for a walk in."
2130,"Loving it here! We stayed just down the street from here so we got lucky to get in. On a raining day, we scored a lunch reservation at 11:30am, by the time we sat down, the place we packed with line! Tasty Tonkotsu ramen. Love the string fries so much. Garlic edamame, sizzling gyoza, delicious steak salad, everything was spot on!Come out about $200 for 4 of us, super full and happy!This is a much visit if you love ramen, 3 years straight of Michelin Star award! Efficient service, beer and sake, if you are adventurous, check out their Omakase!"
2131,"I love Japanese ramen and had been to a lot of ramen places. Some places are not flavorful, while some places are too salty. Tonchin ramen is perfect! The broth has the perfect thickness and flavor. The noodle is very fresh and by far the best ramen I have had in NYC. I happened to walk by this place in my place trip while I was waiting for my bus back at Port Authority. I was lucky to get seated, but I learned you would need to make reservation. They do charge if you are no show for your reservation, so you do need to cancel 24 hours in advance.On this trip, I did make reservation in advance, and given it is dinner, they did not have a lot of availabilities. It still worths it to me at the end. It is within walking distance from Port Authority or Time Square."
2132,"3.5 stars.I ordered the tsukemen, and it was pretty good when I got it.  Soup nice and hot to stand up to the cold noodles. However, I had to wait over 20 minutes after placing the order.  A shop in Japan doing that would close its doors very quickly."
2133,"The ramen at Tonchin has all the fundamentals of a good ramen down: well cooked noodles, flavorful broth, and interesting toppings that complement the ramen. I came here for lunch and they offered a lunch special which includes a ramen plus a side. I ordered the Spicy Tan Tan Ramen with the chicken bao. The chicken bao was interesting, the meat itself resembled a chicken meatball in terms of texture and flavor but it wasn't bad. The bun was light and fluffy and the toppings were great.The ramen was also a very solid ramen. The texture of the noodles were on point and picked up the broth well. The flavor of the broth was very deep and pronounced and the spice was there but I would've liked to see it more spicy. The broth was slightly salty for my preference but not unbearable. The toppings were also delicious, the soft boiled egg and the bamboo were really good. The meat was interesting, I've never had ramen served with thin sliced meat like that but it was good.Would definitely recommend coming to Tonchin if you're craving ramen. Anything on their menu would be a good option, it would be hard to go wrong with any of their choices."
2134,"Came to to Tonchin on a Sunday night and waited around 10 mins during peak time and was seated at the bar. They checked for vaccinations and ID, so don't forget it! We started off with the shishito peppers. The portion for this was super small, but it was a good way to kick off the meal. Next was the Unagi rice ball which was pretty filling. As for our ramens, they hit the spot! I wasn't too big a fan of the Smoked Dashi Ramen, but if you like smokey flavors, this one will be for you. I got the Tokyo Tonkotsu Tsukemen, and this was so flavorful! The only thing I'll say is that the broth wasn't hot when it came out. So by the time I had my 5th bite or so, it was just lukewarm/cold which ruined it a little bit, but it was still good. I'd come back here if I'm craving ramen!"
2135,"I don't normally write one star reviews, but I want to highlight the walk-in wait time for anyone else who is considering it. A few of the other yelp reviews sounded pretty promising and they were able to be seated by their estimated wait time or even earlier. We definitely did not have that experience - at 6:45 pm on a weekday, our estimated wait was 1 hour and 15 minutes and it passed by without a text notification. We called twice after the estimated wait time elapsed, and both times they said it would only be around 20 more minutes wait...We ended up eating somewhere else because we couldn't trust the estimated times anymore. We finally got a text at 8:49pm that the table was ready. I'm not even sure how that dinner experience would look, considering Tonchin closes at 9:30pm.Managing customer expectations is important, and there are plenty of other apps/websites that can at least tell you your position in the queue/estimated time. Tonchin should switch to one of those, or manage their tables better."
2136,"Perfect Pairing Tonchin is a Michelin Bib Gourmand known for its Tokyo-style ramen, Japanese appetizers, and shaved ice dessertThe smoked dashi ramen was unique and delicious but the strawberry 'kaki gori' stole the show Tokyo Strawberry Milk Shaved Ice $15 ~ fresh strawberry, Tonchin honey cream sauce, mint / Smoked Dashi Ramen $18 ~ homemade noodles, tokyo tonkotsu broth, menma, egg, smoked fish oil, clams, radish sprouts, tobiko, seaweed / Classic Tokyo Tonkotsu Tsukemen $18 ~ homemade noodles, tokyo tonkotsu broth, roasted cha shu pork, egg, scallion, menma, seaweed comes with Spicy sautéed ground beef, roasted sesame, rice vinegar with original blended pepper / Tonchin Classic Tokyo Tonkotsu $17 ~ homemade noodles, tokyo tonkotsu broth, roasted cha shu pork, egg, scallion, menma, seaweed / Curry Cheese Chicken Wings 6PC $14 ~ chicken wing, white pepper, teriyaki sauce, curry powder, parmigiano cheese, chiveTonchin (West 36th Street, NY)"
2137,"Not a proper Michelin, but a Bib Gourmand nonetheless. Fantastic spot surprisingly located in Midtown that offers some of the best ramen I've had in the city so far. The space is low lit and intimate, and the bowls are very fairly priced. I had the smoked dashi ramen which had such a rich flavor profile due to the smoked fish oil and clams. Would recommend if you ever find yourself in the area."
2138,"Is it the best ramen I've ever had? No. Is it the best ramen I've had in NYC so far? Probably.The kimchi mushroom is good, but not a must get. The smoked dashi ramen was really interesting, and the broth was the real standout. The spicy ramen was really peppercorn heavy so be aware of that if you get it"
2139,"Really good ramen, a bit salty but very flavorful! The staff was nice and the interior was really welcoming and comfortable. We got the lunch special, which was a bit hard to navigate. With the help of our server, though, we were successful. I got the spicy ramen and my dining companion ordered the original. I've gotta say, the original was the best, flavor wise. I was pleasantly surprised at how deliciously flavorful everything was. The rice ball was fantastic too! The price made me hesitant at first but the size was good and I was satisfied. Overall, I would come again and get the original!"
2140,"Tonchin is conveniently located one block away from the hotel. Since it's one of the highly rated Michelin ramen, I knew I had to make a reservation and get a bowl in my belly.Ambiance was dim and romantic but the DJ blasting music within the restaurant made it very difficult to chit chat throughout dinner. I felt like I was going to lose my voice.I ordered the Classic Tokyo Tonkatsu Ramen and thought it was just okay (if compared to Ichiran). The ramen noodles were cooked perfectly while the ajitama was nicely marinaded with yolk oozing out as it should. Broth was very rich with lots of flavor, but very salty. The strawberry milk shaved ice was refreshing. I really enjoyed the honey cream sauce drizzled on top. Definitely a great dessert to end dinner with."
2141,"Tonchin Ratings: 4.3/5 Food: 4.5/5 - This Michelin Bib Gourmand ramen place did not disappoint. The Classic Tokyo Tonkotsu Ramen's broth was rich, creamy, and flavorful, not too heavy or greasy at all. It did get a bit salty towards the end of the meal, but still doable. The homemade ramen noodles was chewy, bouncy, and firm. Good quality ramen, because it stayed firm and chewy during the entire meal and didn't get soggy sitting in the broth. It comes with three slices of roasted cha-shu pork, and it was very tender, literally just melts in your mouth and requires minimal chewing. It is not too fatty either, perfect. The menma was good with a good hint of spice to it. The soft boil egg was on point, well-marinated with a slight soy sauce flavor and oozing yolk. This ramen is a truly a treat. Ambiance: 4.25/5 - Interior atmosphere is clean, cozy, and has a very modern vibe. There's a cocktail bar as soon as you walk in with plenty of tables and booths for indoor dining. Kitchen is right in the back. It is not loud at all, so a perfect spot for a casual date or lunch. They are practicing social distancing and asked for our vaccination card and ID before we dine-in. Outdoor dining is available too, but nothing too special so, I would recommend sitting inside. Price: 4/5 - The classic tonkotsu ramen was $17 each. Two ramen came up to be around $38 after tax. Thought the price was okay and worth it for the quality of the ramen, but the portion was a bit small. There was only three thin slices of cha-shu pork and like 3 pieces of menma. Service: 4.5/5 - Walked in for lunch and was greeted immediately by the host. Service was attentive and professional. All staffs were well-trained and know what they were doing, definitely a Michelin Guide level kind of customer service. They constantly serve us water and make sure that we were taken care of. Food came out fairly quick, no complaints. BLUF: One of the top ramen spots in Manhattan, although it didn't really blew my mind, but I would say it's still worth the hype. Go try it out, and I will recommend the classic Tonkotsu ramen and end the meal with their shaved ice as your dessert. Make sure to get a reservations, especially if you are going for dinner, line can get really long. Will definitely visit again."
2142,"Came for the Michelin star, and left content. Made a reservation for noon on a Saturday, a good decision once we saw the 10-person deep line out the door. Opted for their tonchin classic ramen and spicy tan tan. Noodles had great texture, toppings were tasty, broth was flavorful, but dang was it salty :/  We were tempted to ask for some hot water to dilute the bowl.Finished with their strawberry bingsoo, which was very tasty. Waiter informed us it'd take ~10 min to make, but was well-worth the wait. Cool to eat a Michelin start place at an extremely reasonable price point, but we enjoyed the bingsoo more than the ramen!"
2143,"My go-to work meal, especially in the winter. The broth in their ramen is absolutely delicious, and not overly salty or cloudy!  The staff is always friendly when we decide to sit inside as well. There isn't a bad menu item, from the cucumber salad and mushroom kimchi (both vegan) to the wings, and the spicy tan tan ramen to the miso ginger broth, you cannot go wrong! It's absolutely delicious. It even delivers well when you order take out (no need to reheat anything). This restaurant is gold."
2144,"We were recommended Tonchin by a few of our friends who live in NY so we decided to give it a try. We made reservations prior as the spot was on the smaller side. We ordered:*Pan-Fried Gyoza: This was served beautifully. The gyoza were on a sizzling plate and the server poured Tonkatsu broth over it to have it sizzle some more. These gyoza were delicious! ( I think I only left 1 for the hubby)*Tonchin Classic Tonkatsu Ramen: I ordered the classic tonkatsu and requested their chili sauce and extra garlic on the side. This was hands down, one of the best ramen I've ever had. (Is it weird that I can still taste the broth as I type this??) I asked for green onions on the side which made for a nice crunch and the chili sauce gave it a WHOLE lot of flavor. I was coughing on nearly every slurp due to the chili sauce BUT it hit well. It was also embarrassing because it looked like I couldn't handle the spice. Haha.*Spicy Tan Tan Ramen: Hubby ordered the spicy version and ended up adding the rest of my chili sauce which he enjoyed. All in all, the food was amazing. I was expecting ""basic"" ramen but this exceeded my expectations. And as I read other reviews, I realized that Tonchin is Michelin star restaurant. Well there ya go! That all makes sense! Cheers."
2145,"Amazing ramen. Food / service was a tad slow but everything was absolutely delish. I had the pomegranate lemonade and classic tonkatsu ramen (plus corn) and split the shishito peppers, Dan Dan chicken (cold, like Dan Dan noodles), and shoestring fries (so good). So flavorful and hearty and filling. We were too stuffed to try the shaved ice but it looked incredible.My two friends and I came right at opening on a Sunday without a reservation and we barely had to wait for a table indoors. They have QR codes for menus and to close out the bill and everyone was masked up."
2146,"This place makes me swoon. I went here twice since the pandemic started and I'm glad to say, that the flavors, nor quality haven't changed. Delicious through and through. If anything, there's less people swarming this place, which personally, is a win. There's outdoor seating as well."
2147,Def love the dipping noodles- highly recommend that. The atmosphere was great. Dumplings were average but it was nice experience. We also enjoyed the spicy tuna and the mango shaved ice was very tasty. There is a 20$ min per person but easily doable
2148,"Ramen places come and go ...List of new ones to try popping up Every winter (which I indeed tried...)But Tonchin stand above all .Great place, great atmosphere ,Great Ramen !!! And some other great bites such as the Bun with spicy miso/fried fish . Delicious!Definitely A Destination!"
2149,"Ordered the spicy tan tan Ramen for lunch. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. The broth was spicy and tasty. The tiny portion of beef chunk bits were good. I found everything else in the soup to be kind of bland. The pork, the noodles, egg etc. all didn't have much to it. The soup also left a weird aftertaste. $25 with tax and tip for a bowl of soup is expensive, even for Manhattan! Service was fine but I likely would not go back."
2150,"We had such a great time and loved talking with Gus! The pizza was great- especially the crust- and one slice was bigger than my head. Highly recommend and I""ll be back the next time I'm in the city."
2151,"We had a great experience at Bleecker street pizza. Can't beat the quality of the pizza for the price. Top notch.. the service was the best around, shout out to Greg he was a great guy! Gave us history about the pizza and was one of the nicest people you'll meet!"
2152,"DELICIOUS pizza....as I write this, I'm trying to figure out when I'm coming back to get another slice. Lucked out and only had about 4 people in line here when we arrived. I thought I knew what I wanted but after seeing all the deliciousness behind  the glass, I was like what do I waaaaaant!? I want everything!!! I actually ended up going for my first choice, the Nona Maria. It was SO good. The flavor, the cheese, the crunch of the crust!!!!!! Best crust I have ever had. Normally those thin slices have kind of a floppy bottom (first word that came to mind so I had to use it) but this place....oh wow. Crunch in every bite. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. My son had the regular cheese slice and my hubby got 2 chicken slices - buffalo and chipotle. He liked both but preferred the chipotle over the buffalo. Definitely stop in here if you're In nyc and are looking for a place to get that yummy thin type of New York pizza. Service is great, they have indoor and outdoor seating, and the pizza is crazy awesome."
2153,"Still my FAVORITE NEW YORK PIZZA after 12 years. It's been a decade since being in the neighborhood during college, so I had started eating at Joe's since it's around the block. But I came back down and OMG, HOW DID I EVER EAT ANY OTHER SLICE??? Nonna slice - STILL THE BOMB. That tomato sauce is out of this world good and cheesyyy.Nonna grandma - Great, but I prefer the slice that has the same crust as the grandmaPepperoni - love that they don't skimp on the pepperoni. There's literally pepperoni on top of pepperoniService always super friendly!! Will definitely make the walk down next time I'm craving pizza!!"
2154,"I wandered into Bleecker Street Pizza on a weekend trip to NYC in mid-January.  Honestly, I was looking for Johns of Bleecker Street, which any fan of Dave Portnoy's One Bit app will know is a mecca for pizza-loving folks.  I mistakenly ate at Bleecker Street Pizza instead (spoiler: I went to Johns of Bleecker the next day).  Here's the headline: it was a happy accident - Bleecker Street Pizza is great!When you walk in, you've entered an unassuming place serving mostly slices.  Lots of people are in the back tending to a rotation of piping hot pizzas that they have to keep coming, because it's fairly crowded in here.  People know where to get a good lunch special.I was greeted by Greg, an employee who graciously welcomed me to New York, made recommendations on which slices I should get, took my picture, and told me all about Bleecker Street Pizza (they've been rated one of the top pizza places in NYC by a host of newspapers and magazines).On Greg's recommendation, I got a slice of the Nonna Maria, a margherita style pizza with chunky tomatoes and basil on top.  The fresh basil and cheese make the pizza good, but the incredibly crispy crust is really what takes this over the edge.  When you bite in, it makes a soul-satisfying CRUUUUUUNCH noise - and it makes that every subsequent bite as well.Now, this isn't going to be a fancy pizza place, if that's what you're after.  But if you're after fast, friendly service and crunching into a deliciously cheese slice of NY style pizza, then Bleecker Street Pizza is for you."
2155,"The definition of an NY style slice, Bleeker street has thin, crispy, pizzas by the slice and the best part is that they don't close until 3am. I'm a huge fan of the Nonna Maria, and they also have a ton of other vegetarian pizza slice options!"
2156,"I never knew how good a simple pepperoni pizza could taste until Bleecker's street pizza. I understand the hype and I can't even explain what makes the pizza taste so great or how one slice is so fulfilling. You have to try it out for yourself! Also indoor and outdoor dining is available, and they accept cards!"
2157,"By far my favorite late night pizza spot in the city!On weekends and Friday night this place is usually open till about 4:00am with steady lines for these delicious slices!I've been coming here for years and pizza is always fresh and tastes amazing!My favorite slice and probably the best one in here is the Nonna Maria Pizza slice which has fresh mozzarella, marinara sauce, Parmesan cheese and fresh basil!I highly recommend trying this slice and you will thank me later!Also another of my favorites is the grilled chicken breast and mozzarella slice!This place always has a large selection of slices and also sells beers as well which is a huge plus for a pizzeria!There's plenty of seating inside and some tables outside as well!"
2158,"I couldn't believe that this was actually a very famous spot. The newspapers and decor say it all, but I didn't find any part of the experience to be notable. Condiments like red pepper and oregano are self serve by the door. There's indoor and outdoor seating. There's a small bathroom inside up by the stairs. Cleanliness is questionable.The pizzas were old and tough. Reheating them made them piping hot for a few minutes, and we couldn't eat them because we were still missing a part of our order. They became hardened.The service wasn't great. They forgot one of our slices and while I stood waiting for help, they kept ignoring us or passing on the customers behind us. I had to skip from one person to another for help.There's a ton of pizza shops in New York City. I wouldn't return to this one."
2159,"Seriously, one of the best pizza you can find in the city!  Always consistent and delicious.  When you crave delicious pizza, it's the same flavor you imagine right inside your mouth, yum.  Be prepared to wait in line with cash.There are some seats available but it's not a guarantee seats will be available to eat right upon pick up."
2160,"After a night of drinking around Greenwich Village, we were delighted to stop in the ever-famous pizza spot. This place, usually mobbed, was free for a quick and delicious order to table in 7 minutes that evening. More importantly, we were able to find a table to enjoy our beer, assorted slices, salad and garlic knots. (All of this puzzling as someone who has eaten here over 2 dozen times). The place is the perfect viewing point of the characters that adorn the Village, but bring everyone together over the warm and delicious food, exponentially heightened by the aromas that fill the restaurant. I'm hungry for them, just writing this post."
2161,"Still my favorite late night pizza joint and best place to end a night; both good food and entertainment provided by the drunk college kids of NYU and most recently the staff. Food is good, but service is garbage. Lines are fairly long most times and kinda slow at night. Fair amount of indoor and outdoor seating. Amusing atmosphere at the least. -Staff/Cashier: ""don't forget my tip, $5 minimum."" He said this to every customer, even if you got a since slice -- the guy behind me was appalled but I was amused. -I also asked the guy for red peppers/toppings and he told me: ""Walk around and find it"" and after I told him I did, he said if he found it sitting somewhere he would ""charge me $5."" Absurdly amusing but bad for business.Anyways, pizza is really good when fresh. The crust is phenomenal and seasoned (which I think sets it apart from the other late night spots). Can't go wrong with whatever you order, I liked the pepperoni."
2162,In of my favorite pizza stops in nyc. Their nonna maria pizza is so delicious and the crust and dough is perfect. It is a quick bite restaurant and thry have outdoor and indoor seating. Their prices are reasonable and affordable.
2163,"Look no further, Bleecker Street Pizza is your classic NYC pizza joint! Pop in, grab a slice and a fountain soda (free with your Yelp check-in), and you've got yourself a satisfying meal for a couple of dollars. Be sure to order the Nona, a thin crust slice topped with fresh mozz, homemade marinara sauce, parm, and fresh basil. The crust has the perfect crisp when you fold it in half, the homemade marinara sauce is tangy and flavorful. One of the best NYC slices I have ever had!"
2164,"This pizza is better than Joe's! We're from Texas, but I've had some knockoff versions in different cities. We have had Chicago deep dish, Detroit style, and now NY.  We had Joe's two days ago and were very impressed. So much so that we got a whole pie hours later. Yesterday, we finally tried Bleecker. Wow! The flavor was amazing. It was definitely better and is an absolutely must if you want to get some NY pizza that hits every mark on crust, sweetness, spice, and ultimate flavor."
2165,Came here with my sister a few months ago and overall a very solid NY pizzeria. They had a very good sauce (prob 7.5-8/10). The crust was the perfect balance of crispy and soft. Nice overall flavor. Would definitely stop here again if I'm looking for a slice and I'm in the neighborhood
2166,"Lots of seating, inside and out. Service was quick and everything was amazing. Momma Maria was okay, I don't think it lived up to the hype. But the chicken bacon ranch was AMAZING. This location also had one of the best pizza dough in the city. Minus one star when I asked the employee where I can refill my water, she told me - ""the restroom"""
2167,"I did my usual run of plain slices around the neighborhood. Although it is no Joe's, Bleecker Street Pizza is just consistently good food. 9/10 times you will find yourself eating the same quality slice. The crust is same usual thin and crunchy texture you would expect. The cheese to sauce ratio is the same ratio you would expect. Long gone are the days you go to your local favorite pizzeria and the pizzas taste different each and every time. Bleecker's got your back."
2168,"TMy main man, Greg, was on point, just like their pizza!!  Easy in, easy out, and soooo good!!! A definite stop on any pizza tour!!"
2169,Best pizza ive ever had! Gregg was very helpful with our trip to NYC Bleecker St Pizza
2170,"So when I say that we left Texas with the intention of eating ALOT of pizza while in New York, I mean it, this place was my number one pick during our visit. It was so, so good. Don't visit NY without dropping by for a slice at Bleeker Street Pizza! Staff was friendly and the bathroom was decent, which gets big points for this city!"
2171,"Not sure where been going on here lately but we had loved their pizza but the last three times we got it there, every single time, we both thought the pizza had zero flavor. Not sure if anything changed but after three times, we are no doubt thinking this is how it's going to be."
2172,It was iiiiiiggggghhhhhtttt. The best part about the pizza was the crust that had almost a pan fried feel to it. Really was digging that. The cheese was still really stringy and cold so it prob could have been reheated a little more. I mean just okay. Really greasy and used like 6 napkins to dry it and still had grease on it. Still looking for that perfect pizza. 3 out of 5 would recommend to a friend.
2173,Classic ny style pizza - so good if you order over the phone you can get your pie in a timely manner but expect a line of youre ordering in store or getting a slice! I ordered a pepperoni (half with jalapeños) that was straight out of the oven with fresh ingredients and huge slices. They had a lot of different pies with various adventurous flavors so you'll never run out of options
2174,"Great place to get fresh NY style pizza. We got a whole Nonna Maria pie for $26. The tomato sauce was the highlight, and complimented well with the cheese and basil. Very minimal grease (thank you), and the crust perfectly thin and golden. Overall, a well balanced pizza that tastes fresh and light."
2175,"We did our self guided pizza tour in the bleecher neighborhood. Johns, joe's and bleeckerBleecker was my second favorite with their Nona slice."
2176,"Hands down my favorite pizza place in Manhattan! And I love eating in different pizza places, I'm kind of a pizza snob. Been going here since I was a kid and it's still the best, and I've tried almost all the pizza places in Manhattan, jus sayin. Definite must try if you haven't yet."
2177,Recommended by a friend of my son and very recommended according to reviews we came! Mr. Greg was a great host and the pizza!.....the best I've had to date!!!
2178,"The pizza was good but we had better in NYC. The service wasn't that friendly either. The pizza has a thicker base and loaded with toppings but they didn't heat ours up long enough and it was luke warm when served to us. I enjoyed the flavours, it just needed to be hot!!"
2179,"We were not very hungry, but were close by and HAD to stop and try the famous Bleeker Street Pizza. I love pizza and wanted to try as much as I could while in the city and this was the best by far. As we walked in the door, we were greeted by the delivery guy refilling his bag with fresh pizzas. He was so enthusiastic and asking us all kinds of questions, you could tell he loved his job! He recommended we get the Nonna Maria, which is their take on the classic margherita pizza. As I said, we were not very hungry, so they offered to cut a slice in half to share, which was very nice. My favorite part of the pizza was the perfectly crispy and thin crust, exactly how I like it. The sauce and overall flavor was perfect too! The only thing is that I wish we had room for more!We had a great conversation with the owner, Greg, while we were eating. He is a very nice and funny guy. You can tell he takes great pride in offering the best pizza in NYC and he walked around and spoke with every customer in the place! Next time I'm in the city, this will be my go to pizza spot!"
2180,"Quick and easy service and the pizza was fresh and still piping hot when it was served. IN LOVE with the crust - thin, crispy but still able to hold all the topping in well without collapsing. It also has a good amount of oil to make it extra delicious WITHOUT it being greasy. Decent enough indoor seating to enjoy a slice or 2 or 3! We had the Marguerita Pizza and Pepperoni but we heard so many people ordering the Cheese so we just had to sneak in an extra order and it was so worth it. Will definitely be dreaming of this for a while until the next time."
2181,"Excellent melt in your mouth pizza! My favorite was the slice of Nona pizza. I would gladly sample every slice if I could but only had a Nona & a cheese. Cheese was also good but the Nona blew it away, so much flavor. My husband and daughter loved it too! The place was super crowded but for good reason. If you can probably best to order ahead."
2182,"Nonna Maria - Definitely my favorite, I can see why everyone gives it good reviews  White - Probably one of the better versions of this pizza I've had. The ricotta cheese was deliciousCheese - Nothing really special about this, I wouldn't recommend getting itEnjoyed the Nonna & White tastes, but the pizza crust isn't as soft as I'd prefer"
2183,"Had the gluten free pizza yesterday and was so so so pleasantly surprised at how good it was! As a person with a gluten allergy, I always expect to be wildly disappointed with gf pizza, but Bleecker Street knocked it out of the park. Didn't get to take a pic before I destroyed the pie."
2184,"As a New Yorker, this place is known for it's high reviews  so I decided to take the plunge and finally try it. I ordered two slices and a ginger ale. Cost $9. Very mediocre and I thought the sauce was quite watery and lacked flavor. I'll stick going to Prince St or Scarr's!"
2185,"Amazing staff, service was quick and easy! They had tons of options for a quick slice and all looked delicious. The two of us ordered the gluten free nona maria with pepperoni on it and it was perfect in all aspects. The pizza crust is similar to a pie crust but worked perfectly. Definitely coming back when we visit NY!"
2186,"The crust was perfect. I'm normally not a thin crust pizza person, but I actually liked this. All ingredients were fresh. I got 1 slice each of the famous Donna Maria( it's the sauce that makes this one special) and the Hawaiian. The slices are 3.00 each and a good size."
2187,"Ordered for delivery.  Came as a complete melted mess all over the box, after waiting 2 hours.  Looked more like fondue than pizza."
2188,As soon as I arrived to NYC I wanted to try this place! It was quite often recommended by a couple of NYC youtubers so I had to give it a try. The pizza definitely did not disappoint! I would definitely go back & reorder the Nonna. Especially loved how crispy the crust was!
2189,"I ordered this pizza for delivery twice while in NY. When I wanted a pizza on my last day in the city, I couldn't decide between Joe's and this place because both were so good. I finally went with Bleecker, and man, I should have gone with Joe's. They lost a star on the second pizza. The first I ordered was the Nona Maria, and I thought it was amazing. It's basically a margherita. It was delicious and the crust was tender. It was everything I thought a NY pizza should be. But then...The second pizza. Geez, what happened? This time I ordered their white pie with pepperoni. What a hot mess. It was similar to what I got from Joe's, but this was executed so poorly. The crust was tough, the pizza cold, and the delivery person was a complete jerk. I KNEW I should have gone with Joe's."
2190,"I'm a regular here and keep coming back. The slogan is exactly what they are - modern banh mi and very affordable. Also, do NOT sleep on the rest of the menu - monster rolls, joju chillers/mojitos, kimchi fries are all also crave-worthy. LEMONGRASS CHICKEN BANH MI-My go to, always tender chicken with very very mild heat. Their sandwiches are always stuffed well w/ meat and veggies. I've had their pork and bulgolgi sandwiches and they're nice and flavorful; sometimes with banh mi you can't taste the meat but not the case here. I go for chicken most often because it happens to be my favorite meat. Also if you want it to be more filling highly recommend adding a fried egg to the sandwiches.MONSTER ROLLS - giant lumpia, essentially. Stuffed with pork and such a satisfying crunch. You can't really mess it up. I could eat 20 of these.KIMCHI/JOJU FRIES - Still hungry? Get these stacked fries with generous toppings. The joju fries are a bit carrot/radish forward so I prefer the kimchi fries which have a nice spicy mayo and mild heat to them. The fries are crisped nicely and tender. Make sure to eat sooner than later as the kimchi fries can get soggy. DRINKSJoju ChillersMojitos Viet Iced Coffee - hits the spot and exactly what you want it to be - Nonalcoholic drinks that you can add boba too; I love getting drinks here because they're unique and not found in typical boba shops. The mojitos esepecially, with fresh mint, club soda and flavors of your choice as well as the chillers, which are half iced tea and half slush really provide a refreshing accompaniment to your meal, esp when it's hot out."
2191,"I'm pretty much a regular here. Loved Jojus since they've opened and it's my forever go to place for viet sandwiches. I always get the lemongrass chicken banh mi, loaded joju banh mi fries, and an iced Vietnamese coffee. They used to have this drink called Chrysanthemum pu erh and I absolutely LOVED IT but unfortunately, it is no longer in the menu :'( (Please bring it back!!!) The chicken in the lemongrass chicken banh mi is so tender and juicy that I struggle to not inhale it in one bite. It does get a little overwhelming with the thinly sliced carrots and radish cause there's a good amount in the sandwich. The bread itself is also perfectly crunchy and toasted.Fries are great when they are fresh and not when you get take out because it can get a little soggy from the time you pick it up to the time you get home. Still, the taste is mouthwatering delicious. I have noticed that over the years, the toppings of the carrots, radish, cilantro, and the sauce have been a little too much in proportion to the fries. I usually don't often get the runny egg on top but it's even more delicious with it! I have sat in and ate here before pandemic happened and it's a relatively small space. Tables and seats can be a little messy/oily with crumbs and remains from the previous people who sat there. I have been here during pandemic and there was a period of time when there was no indoor seating and only pick ups and staff all wore masks. Unsure if there is indoor seating now since there have been random peaks of covid variants again. Definitely will continue coming back and continue recommending to friends!"
2192,"Craving a Vietnamese sandwich but also want some Korean bulgogi?  Well look no further, because JoJu mixes the best of both Korean and Vietnamese cuisines.  They are only open for either takeout or delivery, and have an assortment of apps, sandwiches, rice bowls and curated drinks to choose from.  The food is consistently delicious and I haven't ordered anything off the menu that I didn't like.I would highly recommend trying their banh mi sandwiches!  Some personal favorite items of mine are the:* Soy Garlic Glaze Chicken Wings - This app contained 2 wings, very similar to korean fried chicken, just supersized.  It was crispy and the meat was very tender.* Beef Bulgogi Banh Mi - I loved the kimchi and bulgogi flavors in a banh mi sandwich.  If the kimchi is sitting in the sandwich for too long, the baguette will get soggy, so something to keep in mind if you are saving it for the next day.* Kakuni Pork Belly Bowl - The pork belly was very tender and you can choose your base, toppings and sauce.  You can even top it off with a fried egg.  I will say that sometimes, there is too much fat, but it doesn't detract from the overall deliciousness of the dish.If you haven't tried JoJu, what are you waiting for?"
2193,"I have been wanting to try Joju for years! Luckily, we were in the area the other day, and my friends and I ordered Joju off Doordash. While I didn't get to eat mine until a day and a half later, the banh mi still tasted fresh, delicious, and not soggy. I ordered the #6 Kakuni Pork Belly banh mi. The pork belly was flavorful and quite tender, but I will say there was a good amount of fat. Next time, I'd love to top mine off with a fried egg."
2194,A friend got me a couple of sandwiches since she was buying take out.  She said their sandwiches are good.   I bought two specialty sandwiches: JoJu monster:  mixed meat $11.49  and Bomb me ( Korean beef) $11.99 Both sandwiches are tasty with fresh ingredients. I prefer JoJu monster which is not as sweet as the other.  Kids like bomb me.  Price is not cheap but portion is huge.   It is a little out of my way.  Probably won't make a special trip there but will visit if I'm in the neighborhood.
2195,"Ordered 2 Vietnamese sandwiches: the classic and the caramel pork. Both were still enjoyable but nowhere close as good as my favorite place on Grand St Chinatown where I have been going for years.  The carrot and daikon radish were cut way too fine and lacked the crunchiness and tanginess of the other places.  Besides the taste, I prefer a softer bread.   The Black milk tea with mixed jelly that I ordered was a complete disappointment as it was way too sweet.  Maybe I'll stick to less ""Modern"" Vietnamese food."
2196,The best viet sandwich in town. I've been going there multiple times over the years and I love their sandwiches more and more . I had #3 bbq pork sandwich and viet caramel pork both with runny eggs. Can't wait to go back to get more !
2197,"You want a great Banh mi sandwich? Then this is the place to go!!!!!!!  The sandwiches are big, priced well and SO TASTY!  I got the bulgogi sandwich and the pork belly sandwich. I also tried the bulgogi over brown rice in a bowl.  The meat was plenty but if you want more - you can order a double portion of meat.  You can also add egg- which seems popular but we didn't order it that way."
2198,"Pretty solid for modernized banh mi...4 stars.Ordered the joju banh mi which is pretty much a combo (ham, headcheese, pate, bbq pork).  Thought the bread was a good consistency and the quality of the ingredients was fresh.  My only gripe was the spicy green sauce.  It wasn't spicy at all!  Haha.  Pick up some crunchy monster spring rolls!  Loved the crunch on these but I wish I had asked for some spicy sweet and sour sauce.  Worth a visit back if you aren't looking for anything traditional."
2199,"After perusing the menu, I was excited by the fusion spin on the traditional Vietnamese banh mis. The moment I entered the place, I was welcomed with an amazing smell that made my stomach rumble. Ordered the Bulgogi specialty banh mi with the runny egg and extra kimchi and the lemongrass chicken banh mi with kimchi and mayo. The Bulgogi banh mi was the winner by far out of the two. There was nothing particularly wrong with the chicken; I just didn't enjoy it as much and it felt like a chore to finish it towards the end. The bulgogi, on the other hand, was soft and flavorful and the runny egg had seeped into the bread to make the flavors come together even more. One last note: each banh mi had lots of pickled carrots and radish, but lacked the kimchi. This was rather disappointing since both my banh mis were supposed to come with extra kimchi, when in reality I could barely see any in either sandwich."
2200,Closes at 730pm instead of 8pm? Came at 730 and it was closed. Gate shut and workers said closed.
2201,Love this place and the food they offer. They also have bowl versions of their sandwiches. My favorite is the Joju sandwich and the different fries that they offer
2202,"Joju never disappoints! I have had the Beef Bulgogi, the bulgogi bomb me and the kimchi fries. I tend to have half the sandwich for dinner and the other half for breakfast because I like to get the fries and drink as well. They are all fantastic. The mango slush is also very good. I dare say it is my favorite mango slush."
2203,"My first taste of banh mi was at Joju in 2015 and it has been my favorite banh mi shop since. No other spot compares to everything that Joju brings to the table-- with their incredible variety and amazing flavors. They're pretty much always busy whenever I've been so be prepared to wait or call ahead. There's no indoor seating so prepare for takeout. The spot is also wheelchair accessible since its mostly a ramp, but the space between the door and the ramp is a bit cramped. They also have a joju stamp that I recommend grabbing because you will most likely return. On to food-- I had their Joju Banh Mi fries (5/5) which come with crispy fries topped with pickled radish and carrots with an amazing spicy mayo sauce on the side. The fries are very crispy but can get soggy fast if you wait to long. The crunchy and acidic radish and carrots are a perfectmatch to the oily fries. Their monster spring rolls (5/5) were so fun to eat because of how long and thin they were. It felt similar to eating a meat filled pocky stick, packed with flavor. The star of the meal was definitely the Kakuni Pork Banh Mi (5/5). The pork is incredibly tender with a fair ratio of meat to fat that melted in your mouth. The vegetables were amazingly fresh and a great balance to the salty and fatty pork. Jojus green sauce is also to die for, its creamy like an aioli but not as thick and very spicy. I am a HUGE fan of spice and it really sealed my Joju meal. Don't forget the fried egg, like me. I usually get the fried egg but I wasn't prepared for a messy mealso I went without.. and boy was I missing it. Don't be like me: get the egg. Overall the food is amazing, a must try, a winner. The only issue I noticed was that they're are so busy and their staff can't handle the load of customers. The person working the front had to take customers orders, pack orders, grab drinks and sauces, and also take orders over the phone. I called at 7PM an hour beforeclosing and I was put on hold for 30 minutes and the. promptly hung up on. I was pretty upset because I was really wanting this sandwich, I still made the trek over and barely made it before closing and the line was insane. I do hope its better since I last visited. Ill prepare better next time to beat the last minute dinner rush."
2204,"We have been to Joju in the past when it first opened and I remembered it being really good. We were in the area making errands so we decided to get a sandwich- we ordered the Bulgogi with egg and it came with kimchi. Since we ordered via phone, we didnt have to wait for our orders so that was nice. The sandwich itself came out to close to $12 which was okay considering the amount of things stuffed in the sandwich! We did ask for a runny egg and that was not what we got. Our egg was fried and cooked 100%. But aside from that, the meat was nicely flavored and it was really good! We wanted to get fries as well but was afraid that we would not be able to finish it so we skipped it this time. Will be back for it next time!"
2205,"Ordered delivery and had a great experience. The Beef Bulgogi sandwich I'd still the best thing ever, but the Classic Vietnamese sandwich was also fab. Thai iced tea was great, too!"
2206,"Out of all the banh mi, my favorite is the beef bulgogi with egg. I also enjoy getting the JoJu fries and the kimchi fries (if you can handle the spice)! On occasion, I get the beef bulgogi bowl which comes with rice (white/brown), salad, and egg (optional). It's very filling and is more of a dunch option. They have a stamp card, so for every $10 you get a stamp. For every 10 stamps , you get a free bubble tea or an original banh mi. They have a small bubble tea section which is a great accompanying beverage. Due to COVID, indoor dining isn't available."
2207,Joni be bussing for real for real. This is like my go to when i got the Munchies. Must try the kimchi fries !
2208,"I've been going to Joju since high school for banh mi sandwiches and they never disappoint! I really enjoy how there's some fusion between Vietnamese and Korean flavors in their food, and my personal favorite is the pork belly sandwich. Their pickled radish and carrots are so flavorful and refreshing in contrast, and the sandwiches themselves are stuffed and very filling. My friends and I keep coming back here to catch up and share a great casual meal."
2209,"Oh my goodness gracious me, this is by far the best sandwich I've had in my entire life. I would eat here every single day if I could, nothing beats the bulgogi banh mi it's out of this world with flavours and the salad inside the banh mi really compliments the meat. Even the bread tastes fresh, some places can really ruin their banh mi with the bread they use so props to Jojus. We also got the pork and the kimchi fries which were DELISH, added egg to the kimchi fries because how can you not?! I will be backkkkk."
2210,"One of my to go places to eat in Elmhurst. Honestly, can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches or bowls. My first time trying the taro smoothie and it was delicious as well. I got the bbq pork bowl with brown rice, pork sandwich with added runny egg, large crispy wings, joju fries. Soooo good"
2211,The banh mi fries are so addictive! They're are delicious. I've decided I'm always going to stop in for them whenever I'm in Queens.Happy Yelping!
2212,"Really great Vietnamese place in Midtown! I had the Beef Bulgogi bowl despite not really being a beef person, and it made me want to be a beef person! The ""salad"" in bowls with salad is just shredded cabbage, but it adds a good crunch. The price is on par with similar restaurants in the area but the portions are really large. I would definitely return for a banh mi!"
2213,"This is my favorite spot for banh mi!! The flavor in their banh mi is so packed and I love love love their pickled veggies with all the different combos they have.If you like bulgogi, this would be a great opportunity to try their bulgogi banh mi. The bulgogi adds a sweet savory flavor to the already delicious banh mi bread and veggies. The egg can get a little messy but it's a nice addition when you feel up for the runny yolk. The banh mi fries really complete the whole package. They are super crispy but also have the flavoring of the banh mi with some pickled carrots and radish - it's like eating the potato fry version of banh mi. FAVE ITEMS:- the banh fries- the bulgogi banh mi (+/- egg)- classic banh mi"
2214,"Have ordered delivery a few times and the food has been consistently great. The sandwiches and bowls and good sized portions and you have a lot of options to customize your dish. Fantastic flavors in all the sandwiches and bowls I've tried. My favorite item by far is the Kimchi Fries; covered in tasty sauce and scallions, I could eat these every night and never get sick of them. Only minor complaint is that the last time I ordered, they forgot to include all the sauces on the side. The food was still amazing but the sauces are so good it was disappointing to miss out on them. Pro tip: order directly from their website and not a delivery app, otherwise you may have an issue selecting ""delivery"" vs ""pickup."""
2215,"My friend bought $88 worth of food on my behalf for our group and Joju didn't bother offering him a punch card. What a fucking asswipe move on their behalf. I order from them semi regularly because they're close by and they ALWAYS offer me a punch card without asking. But my orders never go this big so I normally just get like one or two stamps.THE ONE TIME ITS ACTUALLY BIG they don't even bother asking because they probs were worried I would actually reach 10 stamps ($10 = 1 stamp). Never going back because I haaaate scummy business practices. Also, their food is overly salted. Bye Joju."
2216,"This place is like Vietnamese-Korean. The Vietnamese flavors are spot on though. If you're Vietnamese, you know Vietnamese food in NY is tragic, but this place gets my stamp of approval. I came in to grab takeout for lunch and I almost went back in to get dinner lol I will 100% try their other location in Manhattan. 10/10"
2217,"Wowww I never knew what an amazing sandwich would taste like until I tried JoJu's Banh Mi. We ordered the Beef Bulgogi Banh Mi with double meat sans the pickled daikon. My hunny added a egg to his and I asked for mine to omit the carrots. Next time I'm not going to skip on it. He said the egg made his Banh Mi ten times better. Our banh mi was absolutely bursting with incredible flavors. The marinade they used was phenomenal. The little bit of oil dripping on our hands was a welcome surprise as we took a bite. We also ordered the Kimchi Fries which were well seasoned and double fried. It is adorned with mild spicy mayo, mild kimchi, chopped scallions, cilantro sans the jalapeños. The fries were friggen bomb, but sadly I couldn't tolerate the heat. Everything about our meals was delicious. I can't believe we waited so long to pop our Banh Mi bubble. You can tell that the food is made with love. I'm interested in trying the Lemongrass Chicken Banh Mi and the Bubble Tea."
2218,"A friend recommended this place and try out the bahn mi sandwiches.They have a variety of bahn mi sandwiches, as well as other items.I ordered #4, the Bulgogi bahn mi. I love bahn mi and I love Bulgogi. The idea of the marriage of the two is an awesome idea! I took a bite and found the bulgogi a bit too salty. The pickled shredded carrots, cucumber, bread was great. But I think if they take the salt down a notch with the Bulgogi, it would be a phenomenal sandwich. I still finished the whole sandwich though. Lol"
2219,"I enjoyed their BBQ pork Bahn Mi, but was it a five star sandwich and experience, no.  First off, the signage outside is relatively non descript and fades into the background of the innumerable other signs on the building.  This was a destination spot for me and I really had to hunt for the place. Parking is terrible and traffic is worse so take public transportation of you're venturing there.  The decor is little more than a typical take out spot that is worse for wear, but they did have very nice chalk signs that navigated you through the menu and ordering process.  The staff was efficient and kind so kudos there.I was left disappointed in the product though.  Bahn Mi comes on toasted bread, but there is a fine line between toasted bread and stale bread that has been warmed up, I think I got the latter.  The sandwich was hefty, and though not a ""foot long"", did not skimp on any ingredients.  The construction however did not have the diner in mind.  Unless you have a detachable jaw, the sandwich needs to be eaten in segments.  The top bite gets you all pickled veg and bread.  The middle bite gets you more pickled veg and some meat and the bottom bite gets you cucumber and mostly meat.  The ingredients should be layered better to have the same symphony of flavors in each bite, that's the emphasis of this cuisine, the blending of all the flavors to create something better than the sum of it's parts.  There was little to no sauce and even though I requested it to be spicy, it was not.  The BBQ pork was anything but BBQ.  I got pieces of chopped meat that had no smoky BBQ flavor at all.  Neither was there any type of sauce to mimic BBQ. I do understand that BBQ means different things to different people, yet there was nothing about that sandwich that declared, slow, smoked, open fire, saucy, etc.  I would have enjoyed it better if it was simply called a chopped pork patty sandwich.  At least then it would not have been a tease!  I must say that the pickled carrot and daikon was exceptional and the fresh cilantro added bursts of flavor in an otherwise insipid sandwich.  I ended up opening up my sandwich and spreading out the veg and meat evenly throughout so I could have flavor in each bite.All in it was a good sandwich but it was not worth the time  I spent  in traffic and looking for parking to go there.  I also would question the high reviews based on the product I received."
2220,"I ordered delivery through JoJu's website. The food's very good, though the ordering and delivery process is lacking. I tried ordering through Yelp first, but after several steps, it seemed that the form only accepts pick-up orders. Then I tried their website, which says they do pick-up and delivery, but they weren't doing delivery at that time. At a later time, they did accept delivery orders. They only do ASAP orders, though--there didn't seem to be a way to schedule an order for later. The order was routed through ChowNow, then through DoorDash. Kind of convoluted. DoorDash's tracking showed that JoJu had the food ready within about 5-10 minutes, but the DoorDash guy made several stops before getting to me. Soy-garlic glazed wings: JoJu's menu didn't mention how many wings there are, but the boss box was 5 full wings, which most restaurants would list as 10 wings. They're good enough, but they were also cold because DoorDash handled the delivery. JoJu sandwich: pretty good. They offer less spicy options, which not all Vietnamese restaurants do. Matcha milk tea: the 'less sugar' option is about the same as 30% sugar (which is what a lot of other restaurants call it). Good amount of matcha and very nice. Overall: 5 stars for the food. Pick-up/take-out recommended. Delivery can be OK if you're not getting hot items."
2221,First time trying Kimchi Fries and Love it! Their sandwiches never disappoint you! Highly recommend
2222,"Saturday afternoon, wanted to try this spot for its interesting Vietnamese options. No delivery available so had to run over after a very quick window of completion.Had ordered the Joju Fries w/bulgogi ($9), Joju Monster ($10.50), and a Lychee Slush ($4.25). With the time I had to walk home, finished the slushy - a semi sweet drink with a refreshing lychee flavor. Food was a bit lukewarm, but overall both dishes held up well in transit. Fries are double cooked, covered in bulgogi meat and some sauce. Like the fact it wasn't overly salty, and the meat is tender. Sandwich is on a well toasted bun, okay along if meat and sauce inside. Only major complaint is the over abundance of carrots they put in both dishes (had to scrape a lot of to get to the good stuff).Overall fast service in making the food. Did not see any space to sit outside, so definitely a grab-and-go door."
2223,"Long wait, but I think it was worth it. I got 'The Joju Monster' which fits its name. It was loaded with ingredients and a runny egg. Overall it wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorable. On the other side, 'The Joju Fries' was good. It was a unique twist on banh mi inspired fries. Had all the goodies that a banh mi usually have but instead of a bun, it was with a large heaping of crispy fries."
2224,"One of the great modern takes on Vietnamese food. They have bowls, snacks and drinks for everyone. An excellent fast casual restaurant. I would recommend the Banh Mi fries and any of the specialty sandwiches. I'm a classic Banh Mi kind of guy and this place does it right.Only thing missing is delivery for this place. This is the kind of place you want to fill your cravings."
2225,I love the vegetarian banh mis. I wouldn't be able to compare it to an authentic one because I can't find authentic halal ones- but these are good for me. Their banh mi fries are amazing- if you eat halal or vegetarian make sure to tell them not to add the house sauce since it has pork. Their drinks are pretty good too
2226,"I was looking for a great Vietnamese spot and one of my coworkers recommended Joju to me. I don't frequent Elmhurst too often since it's out of my way, but my partner lived out here and I heard really good things about Joju. I heard there was one in Manhattan, but I really wanted to try the OG one before that one. I'm also really glad they have options that cater to all diets!We got the Vietnamese Caramel Pork banh mi, Vegetarian Ginger ""Beef"" Kimchi Fries, Mango Lychee Mojito, and Strawberry Lychee Mojito. Everything was so reasonably priced and the banh mis were huge! The Vietnamese Caramel Pork was packed with caramelized sweet minced pork, shredded pickled veggies, cucumber, and cilantro. I also added an egg which really kicked it up a notch. I also was able to save one half for the next day cause it was that big! My partner really enjoyed his banh mi too and was so surprised how meat-like the Vegetarian ""beef"" was. He said it was the best banh mi he's ever had and went back to get more days later! I also really enjoyed the Kimchi fries. I think it had the perfect textures that were crunchy and spicy from the kimchi and it cut the grease from the fries really well. The Mango Lychee Mojito and Strawberry Lychee Mojito were super refreshing, but also very sweet even though we asked for less sweet, and that's why I removed a star. I wish it was less sweet so it was drinkable.Nevertheless, I loved their giant banh mis and will definitely come back for more!"
2227,The beef bolgogi sandwich was so good. Loved it. The beef was moist. The toasted bread was highly recommended. Will definitely buy from them again.
2228,"A friend put me on to Joju about a year and a half ago and it quickly became my favorite new place. In the past year I have gone at least twice a month. Without fail, the food is always SO delicious & it always looks beautiful as well. I usually get the beef bulgogi bowl & the soy garlic chicken wings and both are mouthwateringly good. Everyone who works there is always super nice & really efficient. They always have fun chalk boards. Everyone I take to eat there loves it as well."
2229,Best one food are good and best spot too you won't regret if you order from there And they're so friendly too
2230,"I've been here several times and you just can't beat the food. It's incredibly tasty, nice portion sizes, and I've never tasted something here that is short of amazing. Nothing fried or greasy. Everything is so well seasoned and there is no need for salt, pepper or other additions or sauces. What I've noticed is that the service quality has really gone downhill.  It's not even the attentiveness of the staff, because they are attentive and food is well paced, but they just seem rude and unhappy to be there working. Everyone used to be super friendly and gave a welcoming feeling. Last night in particular, even taking our table's order seemed like a chore for them. We're not difficult people, in fact, less so than many of our fellow diners, but it felt really uncomfortable because we could tell the servers just didn't want to be there. Service is as important as the food quality, so it would be sad to not go here anymore for the amazing food just because the staff is rude."
2231,"AMAZING FOOD AND SERVICE. My first time here and I absolutely love their service, quality of food and attention to detail. Came in for a weekend dinner with my girlfriend and I am awed that the food is amazing, I have been to France and I can tell that this is the most authentic France cuisine I have ever had in NYC. Love the way the waiter/waitress interact with us. I am a Virgo and I always find flaw but this place is not the case. This is the prefect place if you are looking for a weekend dinner with Franch"
2232,"Helloooooooooo 1000th review, so my ex took me here for my bday in March and there were a lot of things I loved about this place from the decor to the food to the service. They were short staffed the night we went but I really wouldn't have known since the service was still excellent. Fun fact: the restaurant is cash and Amex only, they only accept Amex as a credit card because Amex was the only company that gave the owner a chance to build his credit history, so as a thank you, he only accepts Amex. They opened in 2007 and that rule has not changed since they been in business.The food:Tartelette de Chèvre frais aux Echalotes, Truffes, Raisins confits et Voile de vieux Gruyère- Baked goat cheese tart with shallots, truffles, grape and a veil of Swiss age 180 days. This is one of their signature dishes and it was exceptional. This was my fav dish of the night and I am not even the biggest fan of goat cheese. I loved the goat cheese flavor and the tart portion was executed perfectly. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Pâté de Campagne Maison- Homemade pâté de campagne with pickles and salad. Pate. This was just OK to me, the pate didn't really feel like a pate, it felt more like a sausage and that kinda bugged me. I wasn't crazy about how aggressive the mustard flavor was and the pearl onions made my face pucker because it was so sour. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Tournedos Rossini- Seared filet mignon topped with Foie Gras, shallots, port red wine, truffle sauce. The steak was great, I loved the pairing of a filet with foie but the dish does come off super rich and a tad on the salty side, but still a dish to get. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Gnocchi Parisian au Gratin- With Truffles, Mornay sauce and Swiss cheese. This was good, I enjoyed the flavor and it was really unique how soft the gnocchi was, it was like soft little pillows. This dish, as well, comes off on the rich side but this was rich and creamy. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Carré d'Agneau au Jus de Truffes- Frenched rack of lamb with white wine, rosemary and truffle au jus. I loved the texture and flavor of the lamb, I loved just about everything about this dish except for the fact that it came off salty to me, think it may have been the sauce. For me, the salt level on this dish was very noticeable. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Big Profiteroles- Made with bitter sweet dark chocolate. Nice dish to finish the meal with, it's a pretty big dessert so it's one to share. I enjoyed the dough and vanilla ice cream, the dark choc drizzle tied everything nicely. yelp.com/user_local_phot…"
2233,"A cozy dining ambience that was very pleasant. Their house red went great with everything. The ""sensual"" appetizer ravioli were tiny adorable ravioli that tasted amazing. I had the cassoulet entree and it was... okay. Not quite as flavorful or interesting as I was hoping given the price tbh. I would return to try other dishes though - people seemed to be generally really enjoying themselves"
2234,"i like this tiny little place where everything they serve is VERY French. It's like being home. i went there a few times and each dish brings me back to France. The Soupe a l'oignon, magret de canard, escargots, Cassoulet et Carre d'agneau were all a hit. The restaurant seems very small, but there are quite a few tables and the service is always consistently friendly and professional. I never visisted the one on the UWS, just La Sirène Soho. It opens quite early too, i think around 5pm. I can't wait to go drown myself in french food when this confinement is over"
2235,Service was great! The waiters Nino and  Ishmael were so sweet and made such great suggestions. The food was delicious! The escargot and fondue were off the charts !!! I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Love this place and hopefully will be coming back soon when im in New York again.
2236,"5 starsEverything we ordered was delicious. French onion  soup, was not salty at all.   The best was the escargot- flavorful and piping hot!Calamari salad was so soHangar steak cooked medium  but still very tender and full of flavorGnocchi was yummy , covered w cheese, tooped w truffle but yet not too salty.piping hotFrench rack of lamb was very juicy and tender, not too gamy"
2237,"* AMEX or Cash only. ATM outside. I've had La Sirene on this list for awhile and decided to finally give it a try. The s.o and I made a last minute reservation for a Wednesday evening. The service here was absolutely amazing. I think their names are Stephanie and Fabiano? Very courteous, attentive, and perfect. The server was friendly and welcoming. She checked on our tables at all the right times, kept us in check without being intrusive, and had the perfect amount of personable touch. This restaurant is not that big but they are affiliated with Taureau next door. They offer a good variety of options on the food menu and wine list. I was not loving the atmosphere and vibe in the restaurant. The ruckus was caused by other diners in the restaurant so that sort of ruined my first time experience. Diners at another table were being obnoxiously loud and I was slightly annoyed of it. I kind of was expecting a romantic, dim, fancy dinner upon arriving. Now, for the food. The appetizers were really good. The Escargot comes with actual tools to help you enjoy these snails. I had a lot of bread with this dish and it was so addictively good but I regret that at the end of the meal when I over stuffed myself with bread. My s.o and I agreed to each have an escargot to the face next time, sharing was not enough haha. The truffle ravioli were little ravioli served in a ramekin pot. It was a small portion, but the flavors were impeccable here. My s.o thought the seared foie gras had a little off burnt tase but I thought it was okay. The entrees were very disappointing. Not sure if the appetizers uplifted my expectations or what. The filet mignon was very dry and even all the sauces did not make it taste better. The seafood linguini was very ordinary and bland. Nothing really stood out about this dish and there was either not enough flavors or it was not on the portion I tasted. I only had like two bites of this dish. Either I will skip out on entrees next time or stick to the appetizers. (I find this happening to myself at most French cuisines. The appetizers always wow me then I wish I had skipped entrees.) The Banana Brulee dessert was delicious! I highly recommend you to save room for this dessert as part of your meal."
2238,"La Sirene is a wonderful French restaurant. I've been here once with my siblings and then once again last night. Everything from food to service has been excellent! (Also, the people there speak French!)I've only been to 2 places in NYC which serve good French Onion Soup. This is one of them! It's very flavorful, with plenty of onions and melted cheese on top. The Goat Cheese Tart appetizer is also good! (They also have Ravioles de Royan here, which is on my to-try list.) As far as entrees go, both the butter Pan Seared Hanger Steak and Braised Rabbit Dijon a la Creme (from the Restaurant Week menu) were delicious. The steak was melt-in-your-mouth tender and the rabbit was moist with a delicious creamy white wine sauce. All the flavors were great. Their entrees are served with a nice side of assorted veggies for 2. My steak also came with a slice of potato gratin, which they executed very well. I don't really come to this part of town very often, but a good French dinner at La Sirene definitely gives me a great reason to!"
2239,"We came here for Restaurant week 2021, and we loved the foods. We ordered a few items from the regular menu, in addition to the Restaurant week's. We enjoy the ambiance and service very much. Highly recommend it. We will be back!"
2240,"One of my favorite restaurants in the city. This is one of the first places my partner and I went to together so we come back every year for our anniversary and every year we finish dinner absolutely stuffed. We always get the mussels, beef tartare, and the ravioli (to start) and then depending on how much we starved ourselves for the meal finish by either splitting the hanger steak or ordering two entrees.Cash only!"
2241,"A quaint and delicious spot tucked away on the outskirts of SoHo. They have wonderful staff here, super friendly and accommodating.  The food here is simply so so so good. It's very authentic French food and you will walk away satisfied. I admittedly have only sat in the dining room, but there is also an option for fondue. I believe that needs a special reservation as there is limited seating that allows for fondue. When the city reopens indoor dining again, I can't wait to try more of the menu!"
2242,"This place is amazing! We celebrated here a couple times and it was always the best experience. Everything is  just delicious, cool workers, very attentive."
2243,"*solely based on restaurant week experience*The food was ok, prices ok, space ok - hence the 3star. The restaurant was really tight - ie one step beyond cozy. It seemed like there was a lot of demand due to resto week but they packed everyone into two of the dining areas (there are three ""rooms"" of sorts). Kind of uncomfortable to eat when you feel cramped - not to mention all the winter gear everyone is sporting. I got the French onion soup, rabbit, and a banana brulee. The soup was alright, I realized I am not a fan of french onion soup but i think if i was i would have enjoyed. The rabbit was quite good but the portion size was very, very small. And i know its not supposed to be expected but they served it with rice but the portion of rice was literally the smallest i have ever had in my life (think three spoonfuls). The banana brulee was pretty good, kinda banana pudding-y but obviously more creamy. My friend got the pate as an appetizer which i think was a good start and the Cornish Hen which was actually quite good and a large portion to boot. Overall i don't think i would go again for resto week or even on a regular day.."
2244,"There are two restaurants that I always recommend when someone asks about NYC, and La Sirene is one of them. That's saying quite a lot for a city with one of the most incredible culinary scenes in the world. Everything I have tried has been mind-blowingly delicious, from the juicy hanger steak to the flavorful escargot. The ambiance at the restaurant on a typical evening (not during the pandemic) is delightfully intimate with dim lights and a menu that offers whimsical descriptions of the entrees.I can't wait to visit again!"
2245,"Firstly, we were greeted by such a welcoming hostess and waiter.  Seated immediately.  I cannot stop saying great things about this place.  Made last minute reservations because I was recommended by someone for the wonderful food and fondue.  Upon arrival (the latest reservation they would allow) I found out the fondue was next door, and it was too late to switch places.Ridiculously upset, I inhaled my glass of Malbec and proceeded to order some appetizers.  More wine please.We all decided it was late and skipped the entrees and ordered a bunch of appetizers, and lots of bread, and even more wine.*seared foie gras* magnifique! truly.  3 small bites, we ordered 2 of these for a party of 5.  *watermelon salad* extremely refreshing and delicious.*mixed green salad* also a refreshing and great salad.*steak tartar* not the best tartar I have come across, but it was still good, and accompanied by toasted bread and more mixed greens.*escargot* big shells, drenched in garlic and oil perfection.upon finishing these dishes, the waiter surprised me with a bowl of bread, and a pot of fondue.  I was ecstatic, the happiest woman in New York.  He was kind enough to go out of his way, as we mentioned I was flying out the next morning.  Food 5/5service 5/5If you're in the Soho area, this is a must try."
2246,"Came here for restaurant week lunch time and I gotta say we have no regrets on coming here. This place is right next to the holland tunnel so it wasn't hard to find. The food we  got was so good. The service here is great as well. My mom always wanted to eat good french food and  she was definitely impressed. The duck breast and hanger steak was really good. I got the beet salad, my sister got the french onion soup and my mom got the mix salad. I really enjoyed the beet salad, every piece I had was lIke a beet in heaven for me. Its a tad bit small inside but the seating feels good so that didnt bother us at all. I would definitely come back to this location. Everything was absolutely spectacular!"
2247,"Came here for restaurant week with a party of 5. For some reason, they won't allow more than parties of 4 to book a reservation online, but I called and it was easily handled and we were able to book the time we wanted! I ordered as an appetizer the watermelon salad. It's a simple dish, but nothing wrong with it and I quite enjoyed it. Basically watermelon cubes with feta cheese and maybe some herb seasoning. It tastes light and healthy, but still delicious. For the entree, I got the rabbit. It was quite good and it was a LOT of food. I thought the flavoring was perfect - it wasn't too salty. I would highly recommend it. This was my first time trying rabbit and I thought it would be really gamey, but it ended up tasting just like very tender chicken. Don't shy away from it if you've never tried rabbit because it's definitely very good.For dessert, I got the banana creme brûlée. It tasted very similar to the magnolia banana bread pudding but creme brûlée version. By this time I was extremely full, but even for someone who was so full and doesn't love creme brûlée, I thought this dish was excellent!!! A great way to finish the meal.I heard the foie gras here is the bomb dot com but I didn't get to try it. This place has great food and great service - 100% worth a try!"
2248,"We visited La Sirène during French Restaurant Week and had a great time!(Note: AmEx or cash only.)French Restaurant Week brought us to La Sirène for a mid-week dinner with friends. Honestly, I had low expectations for the restaurant week offerings and almost went off-menu but the rest of my party convinced me to stay the course and I'm glad I did. For sure, if you plan to order the items on the restaurant week menu, the value is really good at $38/person for 3 courses, especially when you compare to ordering these items a la carte. We ordered 4 different starters to share with the group: - Watermelon salad: our one nice and fresh option since we anticipated buttery goodness the rest of the meal- Pâté: really sizable portion of pate and pickles and salad- Sensual ravioli: I mean, they're sensual! but also very tasty- Escargots: for $5 extra, you get little snail vehicles of garlicky butterWe were given bread and olive oil rather than butter, but we had plenty  to dip the bread in with the escargots.For entrees, we got seared salmon fillets and butter hanger steaks. The salmon was fine but that steak was crazy good wow. It kind of stunned us, we were completely not expecting it.By the time dessert rolled around, we were quite full. We tried the banana brulee and the floating island, but found ourselves very sensitive to the sweets and the crunchy caramels by this point in the meal. Service was good and the restaurant is cozy. We had a lovely time.*Of note: the website has a section about foie gras where they include blurbs from both the farm they source theirs from AND from PETA so that you, gentle reader, can make your own decision about whether or not to order it. I thought that was nice, that they try to offer both sides this way right on the website with its own navigation tab."
2249,"Good French bistro food.Came here for restaurant week. I ordered the Paté de Campagne and the gnocchi with truffle cheese.The Paté was very good. It was clearly fresh. The flavors were not too irony. The texture was smooth but still robust enough to stick well to the baguette. The accompanying pearl onions and pickles did well to balance the savor of the Paté with a sweet and tangy flavor profile.I should not have ordered the truffle gnocchi. It's really not a French dish. There was no protein. It just wasn't well balanced. For what it was, gnocchi in cheese sauce, it was ok. The bechamel was a bit gritty/broken but still had a nice dairy flavor. The truffle flavor was generic truffle oil, which is to be expected in this setting. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't incredible. I'd like to try one of their more traditional French dishes.Overall I enjoyed this lunch. The service was excellent and the food was pretty good."
2250,"Wow what a great selection of food and drinks. very impressed with everything we had last night & service was outstanding. started off with the first drink on the menu (I'm sorry for forgetting the name) it had rye whiskey, apple cider, mint and cinnamon with another ingredient that eludes me. as a whiskey girl, I really enjoyed this concoction, the balance of flavors meshed well together and I would definitely order again.ordered the almond horchata and I'm not typically a fan of almond milk however I do like a good horchata and this hit the spot. side note, it for some reason reminds me of my childhood, eating a bowl of cereal and that leftover milk on the bottom that has some sugary yumminess in it - got a hint of that and I'm not mad food was superb. the nachos is quite possibly the best I've ever had (I do eat meat so this is quite the compliment). you'd never know it's completely plant-based. my taste buds were having a party  next was the tacos & a bowl, equally delicious choices overall, I highly recommend this establishment to anyone, seriously fantastic, so good i didn't take pictures"
2251,"NACHOS NACHOS NACHOS ($18 with guac). I prefer having these nachos than other nachos that aren't vegan. Soooooooo gooooood. I have to say that to pay extra $3 for guac, they can add more than just a scoop. The portions are enough for 3 people! Fish tacos were great. Replaced with squash and flavorful all together. $9 for two tacos. You may add an extra taco for an extra $3/4 bucks. My husband ordered the Gorditas. The shell was so crunchy and good. It was supposed to have ""bacon"" but it was quite underwhelming. Wouldn't quite recommend this dish.Both drinks were delish! Almond horchata... I would get that the next time I come back. It is a bit gritty though.I ordered the matcha y coconut cocktail. Cocktails are $$. It was $15. Some drinks can be turned into a mock tail for the same price which I find that to be unreasonable. Regardless, the drinks are worth getting.****ASK FOR HOT SAUCE! and you'll get three choices. I love my hot sauce and the variety they provided. The mild (orange) was my favorite. (Rating was not based on this following experience) on our visit, there was a homeless man in their outdoor seating area which we were able to view from our seat inside. At some moments, he pulled down his pants. Not pleasant, I'd say. The staff did try to remove him but he did not budge. I hope they reached out to homeless services. He was there during our entire dining experience. My rating is purely on the food and service. That situation was out of their control but do please keep in mind that the neighborhood is not the best area. They do have multiple locations so please consider checking them out."
2252,I was skeptical because I am from Southern California and Mexican has to hit right for me. But holy crap this is amazing!!!! Birria tacos was our least favorite but that's not saying much because I would give it 9.5/10 Burrito was 10/10 . As you eat it there is more and more flavor and so so good! I like the red sauce side more Nachos is hands down the best item!!! Plenty of food for your meal. I would give it a 11/10. The chorizo is soo good. Ask for hot sauces on the side. The orange one is really good
2253,"The nachos are to die for. Unbelievable, so clean and not heavy. Couldn't tell the difference from any carnivorous nacho I've had. I loved it and wished I stopped there.I had the Coconut Queso Quesadilla and wasn't really a fan. Tasted like a pasta dish (heavy on the pesto) and it had a sweetness. Nonetheless great food overall."
2254,"Jajaja Mexicana is a little out of the way, but worth it for a delicious plant-based Mexican experience! It doesn't look like much from the outside (don't stumble into the subway entrance on your way in!) but once you get inside, it has a cute and lively bar/restaurant vibe. I started with a pineapple y mezcal cocktail that was very good. I then tried the ""chorizo"" tacos (unclear what the fake chorizo is made out of) and the verde enchiladas (made with palm carnitas). Both really well-crafted and flavorful and not overly heavy. The only disappointing part of the meal was that the rice that accompanied the enchiladas was not very fresh, but when we let the waitress know about this, she quickly provided a fresh side of rice. I will definitely be coming back here to try more items, such as the churros that are supposed to be amazing!"
2255,"Ambiance and service are a 10/10, and so is their dessert and drinks! Food however, was subpar. I wouldn't order the Birria tacos unless you're a fan of strong flavors like cardamom, and the Gordita was okay, however eat them quickly since they can get soggy fast. I appreciated the authenticity of the masa tortillas though. The nachos are pretty good (guac is a must), but the chorizo got pretty overwhelming quickly."
2256,I'm not vegan......But their food blew me away. I ordered a chorizo bowl. I forgot the actual name of the dish. In any event....The coconut-based cheese didn't have the distinctive coconut smell. It tastes like good ol' cortija. And the plant-based chorizo was so flavorful.  The decor was cute and vibrant. I'm definitely returning. Cocktails are $15. Their entree prices are so reasonable. I think they were all under $19
2257,"I tried this place with a friend and actually really enjoyed the food (hardly noticed it was vegan). We got the nachos and had a few drinks. Although I would go back to try other items our waitress was a huge turnoff and made me not want to even leave a tip (but I did for good karma). They were unprofessional and straight-up unkind to the point where we felt uncomfortable even sitting there. She didn't show the same rudeness to other tables so not sure what the deal was, but needless to say not great hospitality."
2258,"This place hits the spot on so many levels. Service was attentive, efficient and personable. Check!Food---outstanding. I ordered the Tavon Taco bowl, pumpkin and beet empanada and the Matcha and Coconut Cocktail. Everything was delicious and seasoned well. If you like matcha, don't sleep on that Matcha +Coconut Cocktail....OUTSTANDING. Everything tasted truly unique---like something you can't get other places. And even better, lots of veggies and healthy options. Double- check!!Their homemade chorizo is yum yum yum. Make sure to try that!Decor and ambiance was fun, colorful and on brand. This place has great energy. Highly recommend and can't wait to go back."
2259,"Recently, I came here with a friend for lunch. I was looking forward to trying plant-based food and drink. The interior was lovely, bright, and modern. There is a fully stocked bar with plants all around, orange lights dropping down from the ceiling, and nice wood tables. For my meal, I ordered Almond Horchata (always have to get the Horchata if it's on the menu), Crispy Chayote Fish, and Enchiladas Mole. I also got to try my friend's Chorizo Nachos and Mexican Street Corn. The Almond Horchata came in a wine glass with a beautiful deep purple orchid flower. The color of the drink was pale brown with bits of coconut on top. It was delightfully creamy, cinnamon-y, and sweet. Chayote Fish consisted of hemp and flax seed buttered squash, and the taco also came with chipotle almond butter and red onion. The squash was fried to perfection in a deliciously well-seasoned batter, and truly resembled the taste of fish. The chipotle-flavored butter added a depth of flavor to the tacos, while the red onion gave it an additional crunch and fresh element. Enchiladas Moles had shredded palm carnitas, coconut queso, guajillo, sour cream, and also came with Spanish rice. This was absolutely wonderful! The palm carnitas was tender, succulent, with plenty of flavorful spices. The sauce that accompanied the enchiladas was yummy as well. In addition, the Spanish rice was cooked well. Nachos came with plant based chorizo, fermented black beans, corn, turmeric, queso fundido, and sour cream. What a mouthwatering medley of flavors that mingled together to create very tasty bites. The chorizo was juicy, succulent, and packed with bold flavor. The cheese sauce with the sour cream was addicting and was well distributed throughout all the chips. The Mexican Street Corn was covered with a powdery type of cheese, and slightly charred (which is how I like it) and was good.  Service was top notch. Our waiter was friendly and kind. Everything was made with such care and attention to detail. I also loved the unique menu offerings. I would definitely like to return and try the Coconut Queso Quesadilla, and perhaps the Peanut Chocolate Cake."
2260,"This place is DELICIOUS! I've been ordering my lunch here for a while now, and I have to say that everything I've had has been so good! This is a vegan Mexican heaven for foodies! Things you should order when you come here are: -Turmeric Cauliflower Rice  -Taco Tazón bowl -Nachos! -chorizo Burrito Aside from these yummy dishes, their hot sauces are amazing! Definitely recommend getting the mild (orange) and black bean sauce!"
2261,"I've never tried a vegan mexican food that tasted this good. It's crazy some of the vegan taco options they had (birria, carnitas, chorizo, barbacoa, and fish), I have never had an opportunity to try vegan version of those dishes. I've never had barbacoa or fish but I can imagine this is may somewhat taste like. It was almost a weird (but definitely good) experience how meaty the texture was of the tacos. The nachos were beyond amazing, a pet peeve of mine is when I get served a bunch of chips with toppings only on the top and the bottom of the pile is just plain chips but these were perfectly layered with so much vegan chorizo. They recently opened a location in a whole food which is very close to me so i'm definitely going to go back!"
2262,"Great Mexican food with a cool interior playing Hispanic music which made for a nice ambience. Prices are fairMy friend and I were starving after a long day and ordered a lot of food: nachos, chorizo burrito, fish tacos and a quesadilla.  The nachos (with guac) were really good and made for a great appetizer, the chorizo burrito was delicious (but very messy since it's covered in sauce), the quesadilla was really good too. But the highlight of the meal was the fish tacos - nice crispy outside but soft and yummy inside. If I had to get one dish again, it'd be the fish taco. The frozen agave margarita was a refreshing as well; it's pretty strong so you'll definitely taste the alcohol."
2263,"Link to menu: qrcgcustomers.s3-eu-west… (4.5/5) The lively, communal atmosphere made eating here a pleasure! We sat at the bar so service was slower but never neglectful. Their nachos and tacos are must-trys and great to share with friends! - Nachos: $13 + $3 guac: the BEST plant-based nachos I've had! Their chorizo was chewy and flavorful, the fermented black beans were yum and very filling, and the guac was definitely worth it for added depth and creaminess. Small thing, but I wish they had more than just a couple red and purple nachos. - Chorizo Burrito: $13: too salty! We could barely taste the ingredients or differentiate the sauces because salt dominated the flavor of every bite. Quite disappointed in this one.  - Crispy Chayote Fish Tacos (2): $8: how ingenious to use ""hemp & flax seed battered squash"" as a substitute for fish! The description sounds sophisticated but it tasted very much like BBQ Lay's, even down to the delicious crunch. Due to the strength of its flavorings, we couldn't taste any of the squash's original flavor. The ring of red onion was aesthetic but would have been easier to eat if chopped.Side note: their restrooms downstairs demonstrate how they turn rustic elements unique through modern and innovative design. All in all a great experience, though I wouldn't recommend the burrito. Would love to go back to try the Coconut Queso Quesadilla and Spicy Birria Tacos!!"
2264,"My friend picked out this place for us to try and I didn't realize that it was all plant-based until our waitress mentioned it. We didn't have a reservation but we were seated as soon as we walked in and given a QR code to scan for the menus. It felt like there were so many options to choose from but we ultimately narrowed it down and ordered the nachos with added guac, chayote ""fish"" tacos, chorizo tacos, barbacoa tacos, and almond horchata. We LOVED the nachos -- the chips were nice and crispy and all the toppings were so cohesive. There was a really good topping/chip ratio so we never ran out of one or the other. In addition, the sauces added were delicious -- if you come by and only want one thing to order, get the nachos!! The tacos were all so flavorful and delicious as well, but so small and expensive. I personally don't think they were worth $8 for 2 tacos, especially if it only took like 3 bites to consume but I understand the pricing as it is vegan and located in NYC. Finally, the horchata was very refreshing and I loved it! Overall, they had really delicious food and it was a pretty decent experience for my first time having an all plant-based meal!"
2265,"Vegan gem in the Lower East. Excellent vegan tacos and nachos. The service was excellent too. It's so exciting to see so many vegan places pop up and this is definitely top of the list when it comes to vegan Mexican food. Some very interesting flavors, the tacos have amazing variances in texture and a variety of flavors in a bite sweet, sour, tangy and just a little bit of heat. I want to come back and try more food!"
2266,"We got the fish tacos, carnitas, nachos with guacamole, and churros! Everything was so good and we couldn't believe it was all vegan! My boyfriend and I are both meat eaters, but we noticed that we didn't feel sluggish/sleepy (as we would with our non-vegan meals) after finishing our food. Definitely get the churros if you're craving for something sweet after your meal! 5/5 Highly recommend whether you're a vegan or not! :D"
2267,Absolutely delicious! And I spent a good bit of time out in Southern California with lots of vegan Mexican/Latin flavors and this is a wonderful place in my book. Try the nachos!!!
2268,This place is always incredible. Definitely try the nachos and the burrito and make sure to go hungry!!!!!
2269,"Kinda overrated food, but great vibes! Pretty good for a vegan restaurant, but I've had better vegan food and Mexican food. I got the chorizo burrito but it was very salty with not a lot of other flavor besides that - almost as if they were using salt to cover up the lack of flavor. Definitely very pretty food though, nice interior, and great service - just wish the food was more flavorful. Maybe I'll try the tacos next time and see if those are better..."
2270,"I have been meaning to visit this location of Jajaja for some time now.  And the opportunity presented itself as a few of us were looking for a neighborhood restaurant in the middle of a torrential downpour.We chose to take a table inside.  The QR code for their menu was pasted on the wall by our table.  We had the guacamole y chips to start.   I then got the sopa del día, which happened to be a green soup (sopa verde).  This was the highlight of my meal.  The soup was thick, had a generous sprinkling of hot sauce and was just perfect, especially after the rain.  I then had the chipotle sweet potato street tacos that were delicious ... the fermented beans made for a hearty filling.Great service.  Nice ambiance.  Everyone was happy with their food and drinks.  I will be back soon!"
2271,"As I was walking to my mom's place, this new restaurant stopped me in my tracks. OMG...I remember that this spot used to be a Chinese bakery. As a kid, I used to frequent the old Golden Carriage to grab a drink after a day at the park with my best friend. When I got to my mom's I check the place out on Yelp. Asked my son if he would be interested in trying Vegan food. He frowned until I convinced him by showing him the photos.NYC just opened their indoor dining again on the 14th. Temps were taken before we were allowed to sit down. Right off the bat, let me just say that our waiter was amazing, very attentive and kept asking how we liked everything. Decor-wise...I can't believe this is the same place, it's an amazing renovation.One thing I read and saw was that their nachos w/chorizo is a must order. When it came to the table, I was like...no way we will finish that. Ummm, it was so frickin delish that we had no trouble. The first thing my son said was...I can't tell that it's Vegan and he's a huge meat eater. Our waiter asked if we wanted hot sauce with our nachos. He came by with 3 different ones and explained the level of hottest. The most mild one reminded me of a mole. I thought that was interesting.We all enjoyed the tacos we ordered. The portions were generous and the ingredients fresh. I'm not familiar with Vegan cuisine but now I'm game to venture more into it. On a last note: there is major gentrification that has been happening in the Lower East Side of Manhattan for years and I for one do welcome it. Some might argue about it but I think it makes the neighborhood more upscale."
2272,I have became a certified vegan food lover! Never have I tasted such great food and no meat in anything. I was astonished at the flavors. This was my first time dining here and I will return. The place is small and minimal decor but honestly I don't care just give me the food!
2273,"TLDR: solid, would return.JPM was a really nice option for two mostly vegans dining on the Lower East SIde. There's pleasant and attractive  patio seating in case your friend has a chihuahua in her purse, which may have been the case. The chorizo burrito was amazing and attractive and I should have taken a picture but also I'm an exxer who grew up before you could do that so I sometimes forget. The ceviche with plantain chips was good. The quesadillas might have been good, but my companion gobbled them down before I could ask what they were about, so--I assume good? The signature menu cocktails were delicious and visually appealing. The service was solid but maybe a little off for a not-that-busy Thursday? On that last note, I mean, it's New York City, so you'd e a noob to expect native English speakers at all of your service places, but I feel that something that felt a bit like a language barrier may have impacted our experience a little. And--this last bit is gonna get a bit OT and weirdly confessional--I have a feeling sometimes that my Spanish may be a little better than my bilingual server's English and I'm never sure if it's okay for a white dude to test that out. Input on the matter is welcome.Last note: someone forgot to tell them that spending money on a sign is supposed to boost the visibility of a business. It's this tiny, barely legible bit of cursive neon that made me wander the block for ten minutes even after Google told me that I had found the place. Odd."
2274,"Review during CovidThis place never disappoints! We came to Jajaja after a nice walk. It was around 5 and we were seated immediately. They have a super cute heated outdoor area with plastic dividers, heaters, and even plants. The menu is incredible, with a variety of plates for every taste.We had:-Buffalo Cauliflower Tacos: simply delicious. The cauliflower is incredibly crispy and yummy.-Chorizo Tacos: solid tacos! The texture of the chorizo is really nice.-Mezcal margarita-Apple Chai Hot Toddy: the best hot toddy I've ever had. Perfectly warm, with the right amount of cinnamon and citrus. So good with today's cold!Also, our server was super nice and attentive. Will definitely go back!"
2275,Yummy food. Inventive and interesting. Wide variety. The nachos were great. Good sized portions. Accommodating for preferences and such. Even the kiddos loved it!
2276,"I went to this place with my friend because we wanted to try some good authentic Vegan Mexican food and this place did not disappoint! Conveniently located on the Lower East Side, this place isn't hard to find and there's so many other things to do after you're done with your meal! My friend and I got a cocktail each, I ordered the Frozen Mangorita and she got the Pomegranate y Jalapeno. The cocktails had a nice kick to them which I liked, however they were a bit watered down in my opinion. The Mangorita had a tasty mango slush. For starters we ordered the nachos which were loaded with all kinds of black bean and queso goodness. We did want extra guac on our nachos but only got a small amount but its okay - since the nachos were so filling on its own with each bite! For entrees, my friend ordered the street tacos: mezcal mushroom and chipotle sweet potato and she enjoyed them both so much, especially the mushroom one. I ordered the burger and I've had my fair share of vegan burgers before. I've had better, but this one was still pretty flavorful. I liked the texture of the chip on top and the burger wasn't too bad either. Definitely a yummy alternative to the regular burger. Overall, I recommend this place if you're in the mood for pretty good quality vegan mexican food or if you want to give it a try! The atmosphere is really nice too and the wait staff are very attentive and friendly."
2277,"If you dont have a big appetite and dont like Mexican food, do not come here.I am always down for Mexican, and what can be better than vegan Mexican??? If you like something hearty and flavorful, I would recommend the Chile Relleno. It is a large poblano pepper stuffed with a crap ton of cheese served in a saucy broth. Oh my goodness.I also recommend the nachos, burritos, and fish tacos.They have great cocktails as well if you want to order drinks with dinner.Highly recommend for a fun dinner date!"
2278,"Excited about a vegan Mexican restaurant! So many options and all available to me as a vegetarian. Highlights were the street corn and the matcha coconut drink, which was really pretty with a flower and a paper straw. Some dishes were just so-so, like the rainbow chard salad (too plain and too much chard,) and the ""sikil pak,"" which was a spicy pumpkin seed dip. The desserts were good, especially the raspberry ""cheesecake."" I would come back here because it was a cute ambiance, the drinks were all gorgeous, and the food was inventive."
2279,Came here for lunch with my wife on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant is absolutely adorable inside! I love the plants and the decor all throughout. The nachos are to die for! Definitely the best nachos I have had since becoming dairy free. The coquito was also very good! The display of the chorizo burrito and barbacoa tacos was cute but I wasn't a huge fan of the texture of the barbacoa or the flavor of the protein inside the burrito. We will definitely be back for the Nachos and I must try the mini churros next time!
2280,Came here for an early dinner date. The food and drinks were delicious. We liked the atmosphere and everyone was really nice.
2281,"Soooooo I definitely overlooked the fact that this was a plant-based Mexican spot...mostly because I was hungry as hell and my friend and I just wanted some tacos. Figured I'd preface my review with this and make it clear that although this was not for me, I really should've paid more attention to the menu. Anyway, right off the bat, we ordered some chips and guacamole - to our surprise, it came with 5 chips. Sure, the chips were larger than normal but still...5?! And for almost $10? Not worth. For tacos, we got the carnitas, barbacoa, crispy fish, and spicy birria. I enjoyed the spicy birria the best - the others had flavors that just didn't mesh well for me or left an unpleasant aftertaste so I wasn't able to finish eating those. My friend, however, didn't mind and ate them all. Regardless, this is an adorable spot to pull up to if you're in the search for some vegan/vegetarian Mexican street food!"
2282,I've never heard of this place before. The outside sitting looked inviting. They were not busy as I decided to take a sit. I ordered a beer corn on the cob and a chile relleno. Come was alright but the chile relleno was super greasy & it tasted like the oil hadn't been changed. I know we are under stressful situations I completely understand as I too work in the industry & I don't like giving bad reviews but I am struggling to understand even though I pointed this out nothing was done about it. Why am I giving them a five star rating; because the situation we are facing right now in the industry it is incredible as we struggle to find people to return to work for the industry. Many of us have found jobs outside; other than restaurants. Please; come and visit and have a good time. Their cocktail list is epic and their extensive tequila and mezcal is of epic proportions. Until next time; be safe out there
2283,"My friend and I get dinner once a month, we alternate choosing and this month my friend selected Jajaja. We arrived a half hour before our 6:45 reservation on a Thursday. The gentleman at the door was able to get us seated right away.The restaurant has a trendy vibe, cool furniture and lighting. We did get wedged into a slightly uncomfortable corner table but it may have been uncomfortable mainly because I'm on the taller side.The goal of our monthly outings is to continually challenge our palates. We've had the vegan/vegetarian genre before but we hadn't tried vegan Mexican before. The menu is cool, lots of choices that are able to be shared. We selected 5 starters, 2 entree style dishes, and three tacos. The heart of palm ceviche was very fresh. The beet and pumpkin empanada was piping hot and flavorful. I enjoyed the tamale with jackfruit. The Gordita and Burrito entrees were pretty substantial and also tasty. We found the tacos to be a highlight, the cauliflower especially. The birria and ""fish"" tacos were also quite nice, the birria was perhaps the dish with the most kick and the ""fish"" had a good texture.Service was solid throughout the meal. Although we ate a solid amount of dishes for two people, I didn't feel overstuffed. Definitely a place worth returning to."
2284,"I'm reviewing this because#1 the food was really good. Might be the best plate of nachos I've ever had; this includes nachos with real meat AND the portion was meal-sized. Also very good: mole enchiladas, chorizo burrito, hearts of palm ceviche and matcha coconut drink. #2 I want to call out the gal that complained about ""everything being deep fried"" and heavy well that's because you ordered everything that was deep fried. We ordered six dishes and none were deep fried (and we weren't avoiding deep fried) Also re: ""heavy"" had you had Mexican food before?Nobody goes for a lighter Mexican meal... and then orders deep fried dishes... and then blames the restaurant. Gtfoh On that lighter note. Would highly recommend Jajaja. Food was innovative, tasty, surprisingly reasonable and the vibe was exactly what we wanted on one of the first warm evenings of 2021..."
2285,I went right when they opened. Amazing food. I also got the Churritos (not pictured) but absolutely delicious. Vegan paradise
2286,"Food is good, cocktails are great ! I enjoyed all the food I tried, including the beet empanadas and burrito. The Chile relleno dish had a little too much clove for my liking. The chili pineapple cocktail and the rum espresso cocktail were delicious !"
2287,"I had been wanting to try this place for a while, and it did not disappoint! It was a little hard to find a reservation for a weekend night but I'm glad that we did. The restaurant is super cute and the outdoor seating was also really nice! I had the burrito and my friend had the tacos made with hearts of palm carnitas. The portions were a little small but were definitely enough to fill us up! The drinks here are super cute and unique and we both liked what we ordered. I can't wait to come back and try more things on their menu! The appetizers looked really good and a lot of people around us ordered them so come hungry so you can try different things!"
2288,"Chorizo burrito was BIG and hearty! not as spicy as I normally like my burritos, but that might just be my personal preference. We also had a dish with plantain chip and a grainy flavorful dip that was unlike anything I've had before. If you want something very flavorful, get the quesadillas!"
2289,"Stopped by the LES location on a Sunday night, this spot is right between the Williamsburg and Manhattan bridge, so if going at night be prepared that it's more street traffic than foot traffic. Loved the all vegan menu, and the matcha coconut cocktail was a favorite. I opted for the Azteca Chile Relleno but found myself wishing I'd ordered the Coconut Queso Quesadilla my friend chose. The Chile Relleno was absolutely an interesting dish, but much sweeter than I expected thanks to the addition of cinnamon. But the Quesadilla was delicious and the rest of the menu  (enchiladas, tacos, bowls and even brunch!) look worth a return trip.Will plan to come back with vegan friends in tow for brunch and almond milk horchata."
2290,Very interesting menu items but taste-wise it's above average if you expect it be as authentic as original non-veg counterparts.The empanadas and enchiladas are good but the Chile rellano was disappointing. Delicious cocktails and cute decor.
2291,"I typically don't write reviews for restaurants, but I'll make an exception! I have been vegan for almost 4 years now and meatless for about 8 years now. My sister told me about this place and we didn't get a chance to go until last night. My sister is non-vegan, my mom is also non-vegan. I went with my sister, and we got food to share. My sister who is a very skeptical about vegan food absolutely loved it. My mom who is also skeptical about vegan food had my sisters leftovers and absolutely loved it as well! Everything was delicious and I love the atmosphere in the restaurant as well! Definitely will be going back because they have other stuff on the menu I want to try! It's both vegan and non vegan approved for a 100% vegan Mexican  restaurant!!"
2292,"Like this Vegan Mexican food restaurant in our neighborhood! Great location, right next to the F train. The drinks are great and the food is amazing. We came here the first time without knowing this is a Vegan restaurant, and we did not even realize after finishing the meal! A must come place with my vegan friends! Cute vibe & friendly staff. Recommend"
2293,"Plant-based goodness at its finest We got the nachos (chorizo, black beans, turmeric queso fundido, sour cream, + guac) and dinosaur kale bowl (mango, avocado, red quinoa, smoked coconut shards, scallion, jalapeño chia-cilantro dressing).The kale bowl would not have been filling enough in its own. It was very flavorful -- the dressing was refreshing and not heavy. The nachos were probably some of the best I've had in a while, & I would probably order them as my meal next time. Again, flavors were bursting. A very cute place to check out for vegans (& non-vegans)!"
2294,"I had really high expectations for this place as it was recommended to me by over 5 people!! The restaurant itself is very nice, and all the staff we encountered were so sweet and very attentive. We were sat outside and it was chilly so they turned on the heaters. We ordered tbe nachos and they were TO DIE FOR!!! You NEED to get the nachos for the table. Y'all will be wanting to lick the plate after. We also got a tamal which was great and tbe mexican street corns which were very delicious. I had a problem with my entree (the Palma carnitas tacos). The flavor was just not good at all. I took two bites and I did not enjoy the dish whatsoever so I asked the server to take it back. She did so without any hesitation and apologized for the inconvenience! My friend had an issue with her order where there was miscommunication with the dish and how exactly it was supposed to be, and they tried to accommodate her as much as possible to make her happy. I really appreciate service like this and the food was enjoyable but I was a little disappointed with the flavor of that certain dish. 4.5 stars if I could so I will just rate it 5"
2295,Plant based Mexican restaurant. Lively fun place. Enjoyable meal. Fish tacos were excellent. Mole enchiladas were delicious.
2296,"So good you could mistake these vegetarian and vegan Mexican offering for the real deal animal counterparts, except the ""fish"" tacos. Great cocktails though pricey (that's the new downtown NYC). The decor is beautiful if you're looking for a nice date night spot and it's not noisy so you'll hear every word. It's missing the kitsch associated with American Mexican restaurants and is sexy like an Instagram ready spot in trendy Polanco, Mexico City and I love it."
2297,"Enjoyed the vegan food here. It was our first time eating at an actual vegan restaurant and we had a good experience. We came by around 11:05 when they opened and they were already pretty busy with customers who came right when the doors opened at 11AM. Service was quick and friendly. Our server recommended really great dishes and drinks and was attentive throughout our mealWe started with the nachos. It was by far the best dish. I eat meat and if I crave nachos I would come back here for it. They had a good ratio of toppings and chips that we never felt like we ran out of cheese or ""chorizo"". We ordered the enchilada mole, mushroom tacos and some kind of spicy taco (last one on the list). We really enjoyed the mushroom taco. It has a great grilled taste. We thought the other taco and enchiladas was okay. The enchilada didn't have much texture to it but the Spanish rice that came with it was good. The other taco we got tasted strongly like cinnamon so we weren't the biggest fan. Overall, we had a great meal here and would come back when needing a vegan meal."
2298,"Absolutely LOVED my experience here. I'm vegetarian and always seek out new vegan spots, and this literally hit the spot. For drinks, we got the Cucumber y Basil and Pomegranate y Jalapeño. Both were so refreshing and delicious! For food, we got the nachos (masssssive dish) and Mexican street corn. After this, we were too stuffed to try other dishes, but I'm excited to come back. Highly recommend!!!"
2299,"If you are vegan you have to come to this place, it's absolutely amazing plant based food, best Mexican food we ever taste.the service of the waitress (Ms Alejandra) was great ! I'll recommend this restaurant"
2300,"What an excellent vegan restaurant! Even my mom who is not vegan loved it. The menu is filled with so many options. Everything tasted great! The drinks were also very delicious. Casual, laid back atmosphere. Will definitely be back!"
2301,"This was recommended by someone who went to the Van Gogh Experience and said it was really close and had excellent food.  On Yelp, it showed there were no tables available for reservations, but we called and they fit us in.  The atmosphere is really great---love all the clever artistic touches everywhere and the set-up with the bar.  Our server was super welcoming and knew the menu---we don't eat vegan usually.  I had the beet and pumpkin empanada and it was incredible!  So many different flavors with the cream, chimichuri and kabocha squash all done so beautifully.  My husband had some kind enchilada and we shared both dishes and we were so into it.  This was one of the best meals we have had.  We will make a point to get back soon!!"
2302,"If you're looking for a vegan Mexican place this is probably one of tee best you'll find in Lower East Side. The food both looks extremely appetizing but also tastes great. I personally prefer eating meat, so there was a bit of hesitancy for me to come here, but I really enjoyed all the food and the atmosphere. I'll just have to get my meat craving somewhere else."
2303,"One of the best spots in an area with many options. Great, healthy food and fantastic cocktails"
2304,"Second time, I've been here after covid the food here is always so freaking good. The service is great. The portions are absolutely wonderful and filling if I could I would give this place a 5+ stars! Their drinks are also really good as well. Came here with my friend and we ordered two items. Couldn't even finish it because we were just too full."
2305,"We ordered nachos to share as an appetizer, and then respective tacos. My friends and I were very impressed by the quality of the food. I ordered a fish taco and was wondering how they would make fish, and turned out it was squash instead! You might be skeptical but everything was so good. Super delicious (and healthier too)!"
2306,Wonderful vegan Mexican restaurant. Delicious food. Amazing service. FYI strong drinks and spicy food!! But all
2307,"Great service, food was amazing. The taste was on point. Each had a amazing taste. Nachos were slamming great appetizer. Can't wait to go back. I promise you if its your first time eating plant-based food your going to love it. Beautiful venue."
2308,The food is something maybe worth trying once but then moving on. My wife however just showed up at home slurring and stumbling all over the place after three margaritas - telling me she is not stable and hugging the toilet. So the drinks must be solid then if not delectably spiked extra. Apparently having fake meat dinner while taking these bad boys down don't help much.
2309,"**Vegetarian/Vegan Friendly**I personally want to order the entire menu, but have been told this place doesn't disappoint! Ordered:- Starter: Hijiki-Hearts of Palm Ceviche- Street Taco: Our Chorizo (2 tacos)- Street Taco: Buffalo Flower (2 tacos)- Sweets: Choco Chip Cookies (4 pieces) Everything was delicious and flavorful. The Ceviche was unique and amazing with the banana chips. I wasn't expecting as much flavor, but they really packed it in there! PS: All of the food was packed and traveled well for delivery!"
2310,Hands down the best first bite and overall pizza I have even had in my 50 years of living!  I had Sally's Apizza 2 weeks ago and thought it was exceptional.  It is not even close to John's.  I ordered a medium meatball pizza.  The cheese is like no other pizza cheese and the sauce and meatball made it a special meal on the middle of an ordinary arg Thursday!  The staff was great and made sure everything was top notch!  John's will be a regular stop for me every time I go to New York City from now on!
2311,"first experienced john's on v-day 2022, even though we have been born & raised NYer's. let me tell you... it blew our minds that we haven't stopped talking about for an entire week that we had to return the week after but with friends from out of town. we agreed that this will be our annual v-day tradition. is the  to my"
2312,"I would drink their sauce.Seriously, if they sold their sauce, I'd put it in a tall glass and then practically inhale it.So look, business, I came here because this is a legendary establishment. I believe that barstool sports guy says it's one of his favorites so I had to come to.We got the large pizza and some meatballs.The pizza was perfect. Perfect texture, perfect sauce to cheese ratio, perfect thickness, and perfect char.The meatballs were a blessing from Heaven. I keep breaking the meatball up and rolling the pieces around in their sauce. When the meatballs were done, I took the bread and rolled pieces of that around in the sauce. When the bread was done, I took a fork and scooped up the rest of the sauce.So yeah. The meatballs alone are worth the hype. Come here. You'll be back."
2313,Was looking forward to this pizza for months. It's Dave Portnoys top rated pizza joint in Manhattan and Food and Wines best pizza in the entire state of NY. Finally I got to eat here last night. The pizza was the best I've ever had in my life. Somehow they get the crust charred but not burnt and the sauce and cheese is very distinctive. Thin light crispy and delicious.
2314,"This is the best cheese pizza I have ever had. I did half cheese and a half sausage/olive/mushroom. The cheese was the better half but both good. You can't go wrong with this place. The crust is fantastic, it's like it is a separate meal full of delight and crunch."
2315,It's one of the classic New York Pizza places simply they have very good pies and great services. This is truly a must visit place in your NYC visits. Very Good Pizza!!!!
2316,"John's is an NYC icon and my review won't affect its legendary status. With that being said I thought it was a good pizza. The meatball was good also. But for $30ish dollars I had extremely high expectations. Like I said, it was good. Not great, good. And based on reviews, most would disagree. ENJOY!!!"
2317,"Calamari was really good, crunchy and tasty. The pizza dough was good, but the toppings weren't as tasty. I've eaten better pizzas in New York. Worth a try if you're a pizza lover."
2318,"good pizza. Sit down spot with booths, pics of celebs on the wall. Always busy, can be quite touristy but the pizza is good. Whole pies only (no slices), staff are very... ""direct"" and to the point :)"
2319,"This was the place of my first NY pizza experience many many years ago. A favorite for locals (dinner lines out the door pre-pandemic) and for many out-of-state friends as well!⁣⁣What we got: Medium pie (14"", 6 slices) with sausage, mushroom, basilThis pizza, made in a coal-fired brick oven, is deliciously thin, chewy, and crispy all at the same time. The sauce is zesty and packed with flavor. Their sliced sausage is my favorite but they only had the ground version on their menu during this visit... But look at all that basil!!! (It's the worst when you order basil and get just two leaves).⁣⁣⁣⁣You pay per topping here which can get a little pricey but it's worth it. They also have the option to get toppings on half of the pizza for less too - great for sharing and/or trying different combinations!"
2320,"I came in here after running the NYC half marathon. The waiter and bartender were both very friendly, as well as many of the locals who frequent this bar. I ordered the light beer and it was brought out in two mugs. I also got the cheese plate to snack on. It was served with a spicy mustard, raw onions, and saltines. Very simple but it went great with the beer!Overall I loved the ambiance of the place and would highly recommend if you are looking for a laid back place to have a few beers. Note: it is cash only but they have an atm outside"
2321,"If all pubs are like this, I am not sure if I would like to visit one again. I visited the pub with a group of 6, and saying that we were not impressed would be a drastic understatement. We felt as if we were hostages rather than customers with no say in our experience. For one, I personally cannot drink too much, yet our ""server"" kept telling us that ""we don't do this here"" or ""no, I'm not letting you share your drink""; we were forced to order more despite that fact that some of us did not want to drink. A few of us in my group are asian and drinking too much is hazardous to our health. Not sure if the server is unfamiliar with serving asians or if our server was devoid of any human empathy, but we were essentially forced to drink more, otherwise we would be wasting alcohol.The server was also on the rude side, as when he took our order, we were pressured to order on the spot. We wanted some time to quickly assess what we would like to drink, but he responded with ""come on, it's only two items"" and when we took longer than 10 seconds, he responded with ""hurry up, what do you guys want"". Not only that, but when he went around getting orders, he skipped the orders of two people and just walked away.It doesn't end there, our beers took a long time with other tables getting the same orders quicker than we did. We had to talk to other servers, and they kept saying that our order was being made. The funny part was that we could see the tap and empty cups from our table and there was no one working it.Needless to say, our server did not deserve a tip. Yet, we decided to tip a few dollars per person. On our way out, our server looked at us and angrily stated ""you better tip more the next fing time around"". There won't be a next time around because we dont plan on stepping foot into this pub ever again."
2322,"After running for so many years, maybe it's time for a name change. I have a suggestion: McSh1tty's. I do not understand why this place has such a high rating. The other reviews are simply baffling to me. I just started a PhD last year and I'll probably figure out my thesis before I understand how this place has such positive reviews. The only reason why I'm giving this place 1 star is because I can't give 0. This place does NOT sell beer. They sell water with a maximum of 7 molecules of alcohol in every glass. So to the morons saying it's dRaNk WiTh EaSe: NO DUH IT'S LITERALLY WATER. If I didn't hate this place so much, I would consider coming here after the gym to rehydrate. This is coming from someone who normally has a hard time chugging beer but I was able to slam these back to back with no problem. This was my first Irish pub ever and I'm hoping every other one in the world has better beer than this place. And to the morons saying they LoVe tHe HiStOrY oF tHiS pLaCe... what history? The fact that they didn't allow women in until 1970, when they were forced to by law? The fact that a few hours after that, a woman was already being harassed? The fact that they waited another 16 years to add a women's restroom? The fact that it took until 1994 for them to finally hire a female bartender, who was told she was tarnishing the reputation of the place? (Sources: The New York Times and Village Preservation.) It's no wonder that even today the place is a sausage fest. In today's climate it's hard to ignore the fact that racism could be the motivating factor in mistreatment when you're out and just trying to enjoy yourself as an Asian. My group was the only one that consisted of all people of color (it felt like I was in Get Out). My group also seemed to be the only one that wasn't made aware of the menu when clearly other people were ordering and eating. We only realized we could order food from seeing other tables and by then our server was gone and seldom returned. He seemed to be in pain that he had to serve us and was obviously trying to minimize interaction, barking at us to order and annoyed that he had to say they only serve light or dark beers. We left a tip which he didn't think was large enough so as we were leaving, he proceeded to say, ""Leave a tip next time - GET THE [F] OUT OF HERE."" If he isn't racist, then at the very least he's a miserable wretch. I've had an Italian friend come here with a group of all white men and he says they left a small tip but didn't have to hear the same thing when his party was leaving. Spend your time and money literally anywhere else."
2323,"Moving to NYC from the Midwest I've always been a huge fan of Irish gastropubs. They're clutch when you have midnight cravings. I'd heard good things about this place and ofc I thought, I would love try this historic one after moving here. Unfortunately, I'm EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with this one.I don't usually leave negative reviews but the experience was TERRIBLE. ABSOLUTELY the WORST pub experience I have had.First of all the beer - THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO ALCOHOL in the beers served there. My friend and I are both intolerant to alcohol and will usually have Asian flush even after a single can of Bud Light. However, I had ABSOLUTELY NO REACTION here after chugging 3 beers in 10 minutes. Now looking back at the positive reviews saying how smooth their beers were, I realize it's because there was NO ALCOHOL. Other non-Asian friends who've been here before said the same thing. They said they didn't feel a thing after 10 glasses of beer and that's not normal...On top of that, the staff working with us was extremely rude and impatient, while he treated the tables next to us (mostly white men) with a completely different attitude. They wouldn't even offer us a MENU even though the tables next to us were CLEARLY enjoying food...The staffs pretended to not hear or see us when we wanted to order food and get the check. WORST of all, one of the staff members shouted GET THE F*CK OUT to us when he thought we didn't leave tips when we did. I spoke to my Italian friend and he said when he and his friends (all male and white) left a really small tip nothing happened. At this point I don't know if it was because we were all Asians (the only table of nonwhites there). Later I learned from a friend that they have a history of not letting women into the bar until the 70s. As an Asian woman I didn't feel welcomed at all. TLDR: AVOID if you're not a white man, if you're into drinking ACTUAL BEER not water, or if you're not into throwing back to the 1850s (racism and misogyny included)."
2324,"An old Irish bar with nearly two centuries of history in NYC, a literary leaning, & an East Village setting? That was enough to draw me in at least once during my 20 years of living in the city, alone & with friends or coworkers, even as a non-drinker. It's well worth a visit by those interested in the history of NYC & its people. And touristy types can now even buy a souvenir or two."
2325,"Absolutely loved it here. Visited this past weekend with family from SF. They absolutely loved it as well. Super chill vibe. You come in-they'll seat you at an available table. You may be seated with another party. But that's ok, everyone has to show proof of vaccination. Beers come in doubles either-light, dark or mixed. That's all you need to know. The beer is tasty-even the dark and I'm not typically a fan of dark beer. Love the richness in history. So many gems/memorabilia on the walls and above the bar. Sit, relax and do a quick Google search so you can learn a few things and leave there a little wiser. It gets crowded. You can find Street parking if you circle the surrounding streets a few times. We had no issues finding parking. I hear the food is good. We will have to check it out on our next visit. Already planning to come back!"
2326,"Walking in feels like walking into a time bomb. The inside probably has not changed since the 1850s. It's the oldest Irish bar in NYC and definitely looks/feels the part.Just 2 options for beers - light or dark. You get two half pints (= 1 pint, maths) per order, $6 each order. It's the same beer they've been brewing and serving since they opened. Beers are alright.Expect the place to be super busy. Very little seating - especially indoors. You'll have to snag a seat from someone leaving. It was really crowded everywhere, at the tables, in the line, to the bathroom, etc. Lots of noise and pushing.This place is more of a tourist stop and a place you can say you went to more than anything. Now that I've been I probably won't be back."
2327,"Not the biggest fan of this place, but I understand the appeal. It's one of the oldest bars in NY and has lots of history plastered on the walls. Walking in is like walking into a time machine. I came on a Friday afternoon and it was very rowdy--no where to sit, lots of people shoving their ways to the bar or to the restroom, and lots of shouting. McSorleys only sells 2 types of beer: light (similar to a typical dad beer or light lager) or dark (like a light stout). 1 order of beer comes with 2 glasses (I'm assuming each is a half pint). So you get 2 glasses for $6. I think our table was lucky in that we got a pretty decent pour of beer. I saw waiters walking around with glasses that were only half full with beer, and the rest was foam. I guess most people come here for the experience, but I didn't completely enjoy it."
2328,"Light beer or dark beer--only drinks you can order, a simple beautiful deal for 6 bucks. Once watched a drunk girl ask the bartender for a white claw and the look on the bartender's face was priceless. On the weekends, would not recommend--fratty and loud. But during the weekdays, nice and chill energy, lots of loud, old New York born and bred fellas having a good time. If I'm in the area, I like to wander in, have a couple beers, read my book. The sawdust on the floor makes me happy. Can't speak to the food, but like the beer, well priced!"
2329,"The oldest Irish bar in NYC certainly looks the part. Stepping through those front doors is akin to stepping back in time. Sawdust covers the floor, pretty much everything is an antique, it smells like my great grandparents' basement and they even have untouched, dust covered wishbones hung by young men going off to WW1 but never to return, over the bar.They only serve beer and you only have two to choose from: Light or Dark. Light appears to be a fairly standard lager and Dark is a maltier brownish ale. I prefer the Dark but you can't really go wrong. Regardless of which you choose, you get two glasses of it. You read that correctly, one beer order = two glasses. Drink up."
2330,"Interesting vibes with cheap beers, but this environment just wasn't for me. Might be worth coming here if you like loud ambience and cheap beer"
2331,"I came here once with some friends after one of us recommended it, and my experience was unmatched. It was kind of refreshing almost, and this old style pub was just a lot of fun. Everyone is super nice and it the environment makes it really easy to meet new people.There are only two options for drinks, light and dark beer. I think the dark tastes better, so I'd recommend at least trying that. The beer is super cheap, $6 a pint, so it's definitely worth it to get multiple rounds. Overall, highly recommend going here at least once!"
2332,"I wanted to come to this place so bad. I've been through NYC 9 times and never made it here. It didn't disappoint. You come for the atmosphere and the fact if you're drinking ale in a living museum or time capsule. The atmosphere was second to none. The crowd was having a great time. The staff although busy, was quick, and friendly and even stopped to answer my questions about the bar. Keep in mind it's cash only and they only serve a light ale (pale ale), and a dark ale (stout) and THATS IT! They're cheap, it's 2 beers for $6 and you have to order beer in pairs. I will be back again and hopefully on a day where it's not packed so I can take my time and enjoy the history all around."
2333,"Always a classic, never disappoints, and great for chatting with friends over a pint or two. Dark or light are your options, and you get served two cups each order! Always rowdy (would sit outside for COVID safety on a nice evening, quieter convo, also fresher air than inside - service is attentive either way), classic beer splashed interior with lots of historical papers on the walls. Definitely worth checking out, even if you don't like beer. Good on the wallet too!"
2334,McSorley's claims to be the oldest bar in Manhattan. And that may be true. Sawdust on the floor. Memorabilia covering every inch of the walls. Coal stove. Unfriendliest service ever. One poor guy was the entire wait staff. I'd be angry too. And you get two beers for $6. The choice: light or dark. And the beer was pretty good. Seems like the business model is to get everyone to come once without any concern for repeat business. 1975 was my first visit. My second visit was 2021. I guess I'm a regular.
2335,"One of the oldest bar in NYC! There was a lot of rich history in the bar... you can see all the old pictures on the wall. I heard the chicken bones hanging at the bar were all left by the soldiers heading off to the WWI war field. The planned to take the bones back when they were back from the war. But they never did... They only served two beer, one dark and one light, both extremely good. The beer cups were smaller than the usually ones you would get in American bars, but they were cheaper as well. I loved the ambiance in the bar, feeling like I'm back to Dublin!"
2336,"They only have one beverage and you can only order it 2 ways....dark or light!  I can't make these things up! They only offer one beverage and you have a choice, dark or light!  What a great NYC find!  We did order a cheddar cheese plate and were so amused when it came. Slices of nothing special cheddar cheese, raw onion, horseradish mustard, a wooden knife and....a pack of saltine crackers!  We laughed all the way through the entire pack of crackers!I recommend stopping here for a few drinks."
2337,"Old school, 1850's style. Sawdust on the floor. History buffs dream, and you can read it all on the walls and taste it in the beer. Light or dark are your beer choices. They taste historic, served near room temp and so heady that when you order one you get 2 mugs half full of beer/half full of head. Touristy, but amazing. Chances are you're not going to run into a local here. But you will meet some fellow travelers, sit at a big table and invite some to sit with you. Service was very attentive from both the sever and the bartenders. There's also some great people watching opportunities."
2338,"""Light or dark?"" That's the question Michael asks. They're the only two kinds of beers they serve. Along with some delicious cheddar, onions and crackers plate. This is a weird combo that I'm somehow obsessed with. What a cool little gem. I want to come back here every time I'm in the city."
2339,"Been here several times now for some quick drinks/grub in the area. Old school Irish pub with sawdust flooring and minimal menu to keep things simple.Their two options for beer (light and dark) come as two small glasses per order ($6). Light is easily crushable, pairs well with food and has a slight hop. Dark is more full-flavored and bitter, better to take your time with, though is also easy to drink as well. For food, ordered the Hot Dog ($6.50) - a basic frank on a toasted bun with sauerkraut and super spicy mustard to the side. Way better than it has any right to be, especially with a dab of the mustard. Also got a helping of fries ($?), which are always thick cut and fresh.Service here is top notch; the guys are friendly and keep the crowds in check at all times. Never too long of a wait, and somehow a table always becomes free. Great spot in the area to just chill without the fuss."
2340,"Super classic irish saloon bar. Simple in every way you'd expect.Beer options: Light Ale, Dark AleTwo half pints for $6 (but there's so much head in the beers you don't quite get that actual volume)Actually have more food options (burger, liverwurst, tuna sandwich, couple others)But the vibe was super lively, conversation was great and everyone was friendly. Service was good - one server even asked us if we wanted to sit as he saw a table open up. Would definitely return"
2341,"Simple.You don't come to McSorleys for a new hipster instagramable experience. you come for whats been working for literally hundreds of years.Beer is good, service is good, and the vibes are there! I've come back a few times and enjoyed each experience. it's unique, its not like you can leave McSorley's and g and find a bar that offers a similar experience. I think thats what keeps people coming back!"
2342,Just as great as the reviews say. One thing I learned was that if there is a classic spot to take someone while you're in the city it should be McSorleys. Pro tip: get a one and one and mix them together for a new take on some old classics!
2343,"Popped in to have a pint (or two) because a single order comes with a pair of beers. There are only two kinds of ale served here. Light or dark. I opted for the dark which was highly crushable for me. Nothing to rave about, but it was more so for the experience. This place is truly a time capsule. All the war memorabilia from the olden days littered around the interior of the pub. Very patriotic, which I love. Served the likes of John Lennon and Abe Lincoln himself! (I thought this was a really cool fact). It can get jam packed during the weekends. Cash only. Fcfs."
2344,"If you have never been to McSorleys you should try to make it there soon. It's one of, if not the oldest bar in NYC. There's a lot of history there and you could almost feel the presence of the patrons long gone for decadesMy wife and I went with another couple an we ordered 10 light and 10 dark ales. We finished these with no problem. We must have been thirsty. They are on the small side."
2345,"came here for drinks with my friends - we sat outside. the servers were pretty quick but once it got busy then it was hard to get a hold of them. they only accept cash and the beers come in pairs so just be mindful of that if you're planning on coming. the beers are actually pretty good (and i'm saying that as someone who doesn't like beer). overall, your typical bar, nothing really ""out of this world"". i didn't go inside so i wouldn't be able to tell you what the atmosphere is like."
2346,"We loved this place and you will too - so long as you keep a few things in mind. First, this is an old-school, traditional ale house. They didn't even allow women in until being legally forced to do so in 1970 (and it was actually owned by a woman from 1939 to 1974). This means that they do not serve anything but ale and they only have two types of it, dark and not dark. You get two smaller mugs of whatever you order for $6 (everything comes in twos). Second, in keeping with tradition, the ale is not freezing cold, its just as cold as  wherever they keep the kegs which is probably somewhere in a cool basement or something. Third, they are cash only so come prepared. They have a small food menu. We didn't eat anything, but the the guy standing next to us at the bar ordered something and seemed to enjoy it. They have lots of memorabilia and they claim to not have taken anything down over the years, including a pair of Harry Houdini's handcuffs on the bar rail. All of the bartenders are Irish which is a nice touch for a bar established in 1854 by an Irishman.The bottom line: If nothing else, McSoreleys is worth checking out just for the history and atmosphere. Despite it's relative fame, the prices are very fair (although there isn't a whole lot to choose from). If you want anything to drink besides their dark ale, light ale or water then you'll have to go somewhere else."
2347,"The exact definition of an old Irish bar. Two options: light beer or dark beer. Great, attentive, quick service. So much history on the walls, the perfect stop after dinner."
2348,"The bouncer was super rude to us, considering I was there to commemorate those lost in my hometown 20 years ago, I was disappointed in this spot. When I tried taking my drinks out of the bar, he stopped us and when I said ""oh my friend has a table outside"" he said he ""couldn't care less"" and turned away. Honestly, I'm glad I held back because it was a very important day for me, but I was extremely disappointed in this treatment. I'm born and raised in NYC, I saw everything this city went through as a 5 year old. I fought back alongside everyone, this treatment was so disappointing."
2349,"The oldest Irish  beer bar, I don't really drink beer so I haven't been here for at least almost10 year. It's used to be so crowded back then but since Covid19 and Sunday nite nothing better to have a place to hang out at10pm.1. They make sure they checked ur temperature. 2. Service was a 4stars , they are nice and hot no complain.3. $6 for 2 beers choices of dark or light beer.4. Great atmosphere there are also open outdoor as well.5. They have their limited food menu, you have to ordered something to eat by the law since it tye Covid19 ."
2350,"Good customer service, unique set-up but fun, you have 2 choices of beer , light or dark, you get 2 mugs of your beer each time, they have a small menu of food, communal seating, get to meet new people, quick service , lots of history"
2351,What I wouldn't give to live a block away from this place.
2352,"This is the single greatest bar on the planet earth. I have been working in the bar and restaurant industry for my entire adult life and can say that McSorley's is what all of us are trying to achieve. They do what they do. And what they do they've been doing for 160+ years. If you don't like it, leave.But you'll like it, trust me.It's everything I want in a bar: full of characters who can give you rich and interesting conversation, cold beer, a menu characterized by simplicity, and endless history.I mean, dude, there's like 15 dead people behind the bar. There's a chair ABRAHAM LINCOLN sat in, behind the bar. There's WWI and WWII helmets behind the bar. And then all around you are photographs and lithographs dating from your grandad's grandad's time. You want a sports bar with TV and 12 different cocktail options? Don't go here. You want gluten free pizza with a natural wine? Don't go here. You want a turkey sandwich and a beer and pay $12? Go here. Service? Couldn't be better."
2353,Fun place oldest bar in New York and it's still there.  They only serve two type of beer but it's fun and you meet people.  Sitting and talking with complete strangers is great you learn a lot about the people and the city.  Food is a new thing being served so that's smart to keep you there. But I would recommend eating and then going drinking.  Plan on staying awhile it's an addictive atmosphere!! Enjoy when your there
2354,"On our last trip to NYC, our friend Crystal was with us and told us we needed to stop here for a beer. It's the oldest Irish pub in NYC and we really liked it. You won't find a bunch of TVs or loud music playing. They only have two beers--a light and a dark beer. You pay $6 for both beers (I think). One of each is served together so you can't get just one. I don't like beer, but my husband enjoyed the light beer and Crystal enjoyed the dark beer. The decor is exactly what you would expect from an Irish pub. Seat yourself when you get there. Share a partially open table. This no frills pub is definitely worth checking out."
2355,Servers never wear mask as you can see in the photo. They took away my beer when I was not done and they don't serve you water.
2356,"Be Good or Be Gone! McSorleys is a must experience when visiting NYC. Allow time tho as it's not very big, bring cash, no CC, be prepared to sit or stand with others. You can only order 2 beers at a time. Yep that the way the cone 2/$6. Light or dark ; their own beer. I would highly recommend reading about Mc Sorleys Old Ale House before going. It has quite the history which is fascinating. You then can search on the walls for the unique things and artifacts that have been there since they opened in 1854.As they Say : We were here before you were born!If available buy the cool T-Shirt!"
2357,"We stumbled across this place on a recent visit to Manhattan and it might have been our favorite experience of the entire trip.  I had no idea what we were getting ourselves into when I walked in, but the people behind the bar were amazingly helpful even amidst a crowded space.  We ended up sitting outside and had great service.  Our server was over the moon excited about the hotdogs we ordered, giving us some history on their brand, giving us some history about the bar, and providing one of the best experiences we had in the city.  I can't wait to visit again on our next trip!"
2358,"Wow, this place is amazing. Full of history and a vibe that makes me wanna go back. A must see if and when you're in New York"
2359,"I think after this recent visit, I realize now this is more a tourist place than for locals. I stop here sometimes when I come home to visit but usually stay for only a round or two. This place is always crowded so there is not much room to enjoy the beers. In between my visit  and writing this review, Matty (the owner) has passed away. My mother was close with him but he was not there during my recent visit. With that being said, Marty continued the nostalgia throughout his ownership.There is only light or dark beers served here. I always go with the dark and it's pretty good. They serve a beer in 2 mugs at a time. So if you ask for 2 darks, you will receive 4 beers. There is also a small variety of food you can order. The atmosphere and the way things run are difficult to describe in a review so it would be best to actually experience it all. The turnover in here is pretty quick with service, cleaning glasses, and customers coming and going.Like I mentioned, this place is always bustling so the majority of times I visited, we stood at the bar. There are plenty of tables but they are usually full. This most recent time, we ordered at the bar even though a table was open. The bartender offered us to sit there and I told him we were not ordering food. He said we did not need to. We ordered a round of dark and he told us a server would bring them over. Quickly, our server brought over our beers and greeted us. He was very attentive throughout our visit. When he disappeared, another server took over immediately. It was close to when we were leaving so I requested our check. Holy shit-$60! Lol I mean we had like 5 rounds but that was a lot more than I was expecting. This was probably the longest I stayed here so I guess I should not be surprised. I have also become accustomed to FL prices lol. Anyway, whether you grew up in NYC or you are a tourist, it would be a shame if you missed out on such a historical place!"
2360,"I love this place.I usually order the steak burritos which are delish and heavy. Everything cooked and made to perfection I most recently had the breakroom burger and tots.I re-iterate again that this place is really good. The burger is quite heavy for my liking,  but I'd do it all over again. A guilty pleasure if you will"
2361,"Perhaps I had high expectations for tacos from a place in Chinatown, but I ended up feeling like I'd been misled by some of the reviews. I ordered the carnitas tacos here, and they came out like this, chunks of meat with some pico in a flour(?) tortilla. I had two bites and couldn't continue; it just didn't taste right.Three stars because the fries I ordered on the side were good, the service was decent, and the shop seemed clean. I might come back for a sandwich but not for tacos."
2362,"I ordered the tempura fish taco platter with sauce on the side. Instead, I received 1 slither of fish in each taco. No lettuce, no pick de gallo, no avocado and coleslaw on the side. And the tacos had the nerve to be rubbery. I work in the area and eat here all the time. Won't be ordering from here anymore."
2363,"Long overdue, but Breakroom has always been my go-to place for awesome pork belly and tempura fish tacos. Their mint lemonade is also great. Haha, these three items are always what we get when we come here, in addition occasionally to the fries which are also filling due to all the toppings. The pork belly is my personal favorite although it might get stuck on your teeth due to the chewiness-- and the tempura fish is always freshly fried. The veggies and sauces in the taco are an awesome mix, I promise you'll find your go to taco here!Note that there aren't many seats and the existing seating is a bit of a squeeze since this is more of a convenience, elevated fast food type of place. But Breakroom has earned its great rep in the community!"
2364,"3.5 stars, the tacos are decent, but for the price and portion, I don't think it's really worth it. Would rather just get Los Tacos No. 1"
2365,"I haven't been here in a few years, but was really glad I stoped in today.  This spot has always been tiny, but you can see. Ganges due to covid restrictions have taken place.  So be warned, seating is super limited and they are requiring proof of vaccinating to dine in.  Mint lemonade was awesome!Tortilla were a little over done today... but honestly the quality of their tacos is so good that your tastes buds over look that."
2366,"We only got the breakroom fries here because we wanted a quick bite before Blood Manor, and it HIT THE SPOT. Exactly what I wanted my loaded fries to be - crispy and soft, sufficient cheese and meat bits, with the fried egg on top.They also have maybe a hundred hot sauce bottles (ranges from mild to super hot) inside, although there's probably only like 4-5 kinds."
2367,"True deliciousness. Got this through a delivery order, and they followed all the instructions to a few. Loved the burger and the onion rings. The food still came hot and crispy despite that being a common issue with fried foods being deliver d/ Tried the pork belly taco from the boyfriend - not as much into it as it leans towards grisly over crispy. All in all, an excellent place. Would definitely return when a need for grease is calling."
2368,"I stopped by this spot on my lunch break and ordered the taco platter (two tempura fish tacos and one chicken) for $15. The fish tacos were crispy and I liked the generous avocado they serve with it (some places only give you a sliver or two). The show stealer would be the chicken. I underestimated the chicken thinking it would be dry and flavorless, but it was juicy and full of flavor given the pico de gallo. Employees were friendly and quick."
2369,"Mint lemonade was bomb- perfect balance between sweet and refreshing flavors. Most lemonades I've tried are too sweet. This one isn't. As for the rib eye steak sandwhich, the meat is well seasoned and cheesy. Very nicely wrapped to ensure the product doesn't get cold. The only thing wish could be better was the bread- the inside was too bland, not the typical hero bread I usually eat. Otherwise this is great place for a quick bite."
2370,The prices are reasonable in contrast to many bakeries. The sweets are fresh and tasty.I would highly recommend this place .
2371,"Oh man, the pastries are swwwweeetttt! Be warn that it's super heavy and definitely needs some coffee to go with it. Unfortunately, it was late in the evening so we opt out on the coffee. We just had dinner and wanted some light dessert afterwards. Little did we know....The dessert just slapped us in the face (as expected of Italian desserts) . What were we even thinking?! LOL. - I would get some lobster tail! Super light! Nice after dinner dessert. - The Torte Di Mandorle and Camillia are super sugary. Definitely would get some coffee or tea with it. - The Fruit tart was mediocre. Inhaled the fruits but the custard/cream wasn't as creamy as I would like."
2372,Absolutely the best tiramisu and lobster tail I had in New York! Took these to go and want to go back already. Also tried their Italian cheesecake in store and it's light and sweet. None of their cakes are too dense or too filling- which is perfect if you want to try several slices!
2373,"I have lived in New York for 8 years. Veniero's has always been my go-to for Italian pastries, cakes, and cookies. I have been here countless times, and I'm surprised that I never reviewed before. I have never had a bad experience, and everything is delicious. Their cannolis are excellent, and their cheesecake is the best I've ever had. Sit down and enjoy a nice espresso with a cake, and enjoy taking a trip back in time to the only authentic Italian pastry shop in Manhattan."
2374,"I should give you guys a negative 10 stars and if I did not have such a long history with Veniero's I would do so!!!  I ordered two shots of espresso decaf.  it was late in the evening.  The waiter who heard me well and acknowledged my request, did what was easiest.  Two shots of full strength espresso that lasted me until dawn.  In addition, the wait to get served was 40 minutes at 10pm.   Nonetheless, Veniero's is a traditional of NYC.  It has been there since my parents were growing up and remains very much a landmark.  The selection of desserts and pastry are unchallenged - they are huge and delicious.  My recommendation:  Go on a weeknight or at least advocate for yourself if something like this is pulled."
2375,"A recent visit changed the way I feel about this place and sadly don't think we will be back anymore!We frequented this Italian bakery for 18 years (mostly on take away especially for gatherings and parties), also recommended and brought many many out of town friends there. But sadly about a month ago we encountered very bad takeout counter customer service after we had sit down dessert there with friends.Here's what happened. We and 4 friends had dessert there one night. After we finished and on the way out, hubby and I wanted to pick up something to bring to our friend's BBQ the next day.  Someone behind the counter said they were closed.  Since they were still serving the last take out customer, I told them we just finished having dessert there and asked if we could just get a cake to go.  Salesperson A said bluntly ""we are closed"".  That's fine, when we were about to move towards the door, salesperson B asked ""you want a whole cake?"" I replied ""yes, a tiramisu cake if it's okay.""   Salesperson B said okay and I said thank you for that.  However while B was getting us the order, A said again in front of us ""we are closed already.""  I said ""I understand.""  That didn't stop there!!!  Salesperson A said it again for the 3rd time ""we are closed""  Then I replied ""I understand, you guys could told us you don't want to.......sell it (But I didn't get to finished my sentence) as A cut me off and said ""yea, for next time!"" Wow, what kind of attitude was that for customer service?!?  So I shot back ""if there's a next time!"" At that point my hubby said we don't need this shit. As we were leaving we told A we didn't want the cake anymore and there won't be a next time! Having this sale person's attitude in customer service won't do any good to the business. And my bottom line IF just IF this bad apple is somehow related to the owner, that's even worse!!!And just like that, Veniero's is history to us! No more. It's the principle plus there are many other options around town."
2376,"8.4/10NY-style cheesecake: Good cheesecake; flavor wasn't quite strong enough for my taste, but it was the right amount of sweetness; I would say the strawberries didn't complement the actual cheesecake very well; I feel like a crust in there somewhere would definitely help"
2377,Old school Italian bakery from the 1890s . Great stuff . I always come on Thanksgiving morning early...at like 9am and it's already crowded and you have to take a number. The Blood Orange chocolate slice of pastry is a highlight. Also the Baba Rum which is a little sponge cake that's clam shaped and soaked in Rum and filled with cream. Delicious. The cookies with jam in the middle and chocolate dipped on one end are classic as well. They have little Bavarian cream tarts with raspberry on top in either vanilla or chocolate. They make whole cakes to go too. Check out the massive Sicilian cheesecake on the counter !
2378,Can't go wrong here. Best cheesecake and pignoli cookies! Go at night for a fun time out after dinner.
2379,Wow!! It's a classic. I would come here with my then boyfriend now husband many years ago and now I was happy to share my love for this establishment with my children. So it's become a family affair. We went this weekend and enjoyed there delicious desserts. Thank you!! If you plan on visiting NYC you must make this one of your destination stops and enjoy the delicious food here in Veniero's.
2380,"Easily the best meal of 2020 and here's why...You wouldn't think to combine lobster & burrata, but they did and perfected it. Fresh basil and eggplant flavors on top of fresh Nova Scotia lobster (melt in your mouth tender) and burrata smoother than George Clooney.Grilled octopus cooked perfectly with charred grill taste but somehow melt in your mouth tender again.Spaghetti with calamari, garlic and some heat from the pepperoncino that was delicious and perfectly al dente.Save the best for last though, right? Their most popular pasta is the fusilli with red wine braised octopus and bone marrow and for goooood reason folks! This was the best pasta I've ever had. Rich and creamy bone marrow mixed in with that braised octopus was to die for, oh and the fresh fusilli didn't hurt...cant wait to return, what a birthday!"
2381,"A total gem. Great upscale Italian option - expect to pay a mint for very tiny portions but the food is amazing. The waiter was really nice and recommended some wine. The drinks were good. Definitely get the pasta - the ravioli doppi with chicken sausage - some of the best pasta I've had in a while. We wanted to get the whole fish but they sold out so we ordered the bass, which was really good. The dessert was only ok- mousse was very rich and tiramisu had too much cream so would probably skip or split one of these."
2382,"Passers, Tonni and Spigolo, oh my!....leaving the Hamachi left to discover! I am overjoyed when Crudo appears on any menu. Hamachi is seemingly the fish of choice so I've had my share. Saving this for last at Marea may be a jinx for Michael's preparation may very well ruin me me for life! Other favorites remain the Spaccatelli, Agnolotti, Zappa and the Rombo although I dream in Marea. If I could have a dream come true, long ago, he made a calamari tagliatelle that was divine. Fingers crossed that comes back one day! I literally make a bee line to Marea every time I'm in Manhattan!"
2383,Got the octopus dish which was a little over salted but delicious!! Huge portion! The wine list was Devine!! Got a pasta dish full of seafood that was also yummy! The desserts are so good including the sorbet!! Server gave us a few complimentary dishes including lobster ravioli!! Amazing service!! Would definitely recommend and come again!!
2384,"Delicious food, the pasta is perfect and so was the soup. It was my third time here and order something different each time. All delicious! I love sitting at the bar to watch all the action."
2385,"I used to love their pasta! Especially the fusilli. Now the quality has gone done dramatically and the service is subpar. The prices have skyrocketed. They are at this point just resting on their former laurels. The crudo was bland, the insalata looked like it came from Applebee's, the entrees was tepid, the pasta barely warm. When we requested that it should be served hot, they nuked it in the microwave and it became soggy. Really bad experience for a $1200 tab for 6 ppl. I don't recommend this restaurant."
2386,"I was so happy we could get a reservation ! The outdoor dining is set up beautifully with lights and heaters .Let me tell you .. the food , service and ambiance are too notch ! I  vegetarian and had no trouble finding food and it's one of the best meals I've ever had ! I had the truffle pasta (minus the anchovy paste ) Perfect in every way!"
2387,"I'm always looking for a reason to ""celebrate"" with dinner so finding a new job after being laid off for three months was no exception. The Mr. passed by Marea during one of his daily runs and remarked how beautiful the decorations were so this was an easy choice. We came on the pleasant Sat evening before Labor Day to enjoy an outdoor dinner. Food (8.0) For starters, we shared the burrata with lobster which was served with the most delicious, minuscule tomatoes I've ever had. Our server was gracious enough to split this being that I'm allergic to shellfish. If there's ever a time I wish I could eat it, that would've been the day. Hubs had the Trofie Nero and I, the snapper. Whilst the pasta looked great, he said it lacked flavor and substance. For the price and reputation, one would've expected a slightly larger serving. My snapper, on the other hand, was cooked perfectly although this dish too, was quite light. I wish the servers would've done a better job of recommending I order a side dish of potatoes (which I ended up ordering) as I would've done so when placing my order so my dish would not have cooled).For dessert, we shared the tiramisu which was also small but tasty, and the pistachio gelato which was creamy and well-balanced. Finally, we concluded our meal with a cappuccino that would make any Italian proud. While our overall experience was good and I'd dine here again, I would not deem it Michelin-worthy at least not in the current environment. I look forward to the day restaurants return to their full glory. In the meantime, I'll continue to patronize the many other wonderful restaurants this great city has to offer."
2388,"Is Marea worth the hype? Yes yes yes! We had a 5:30 reservation and upon arriving the hostess checked us in and had our temperature taken. We were taken to our table and brought menus. The restaurant separates tables far enough and put up barriers as well. We had the lobster burrata salad to start. It was delicious. The cheese was buttery and lobster melts in your mouth. The octopus pasta was flavorful, pasta was chewy, lots of octopus and bone marrow bites. The scallops were seared and seasoned perfectly. We also had two desserts. One was chocolate and the other was the panna cotta. Can't wait to come back!!!"
2389,"Clearly one of the best dining spots in NYC.We were celebrating a promotion and were lucky to snag an outdoor table a few weeks out (they are at 50% indoor dining).Impeccable service. And you came for the food.Their cocktail service is outstanding ($21 - $24 each).Appetizers were crudo di Hamachi and asparagus blanchi. Entrees were Gigli, Fusilli, agnotti, and agnello. Hate to use the term again but ""outstanding"".Three desserts - tiramisu, panna cotta, and almond crostata - and a few coffees finished a memorable meal.Adding in a $150 Italian red, 5% COVID recovery fee, and tip totalled damages of $750. Well worth it!"
2390,"Very good meal and reasonable for the price point. I felt that the service was very good--not pretentious but attentive. There was one point where a waiter asked if I was finished eating as I was putting food into my mouth, which is why I put 4 stars. However, from a food standpoint, everything was executed perfectly. The tomatoes they use in their sauce.. next level. We were pleased by the portion sizes and their willingness to split things--we split the appetizer (grilled octopus) and the pasta (squid ink lobster ravioli) and the pictures below show the individual portions. We finished with Branzino, which had very plain plating, but was really wonderfully cooked and served. I'd come back!"
2391,"Pretty underwhelming for a Michelin Star restaurant... I have a fennel and anise allergy. I listed this on our reservation, and mentioned it when we sat down to our waiter. This didn't seem to be a problem until after we had finished our appetizer and about 5 minutes before our entrees should have come out. Our server comes over to our table and asks ""how allergic to fennel are you?"" to which I replied, ""my throat will close up.""  I had ordered the lobster ravioli. Then he rushes back to the kitchen and comes back about 3 minutes later and says that fennel is in the pasta and would I like the pasta with a different sauce like a red sauce or a white sauce and I say sure.Our entrees come out. My boyfriends entree looks good and I receive a kids size spaghetti and bolognese.... And we're both looking at each other confused and call the serve back over and ask why I didn't receive the ravioli. He says there's fennel in the pasta, you said this was fine. At which point we realize he's trying to say that there is fennel in the sauce inside of the ravioli, which he did not say. He goes on to say that it's in all of the sauces because it's in the can of sauce they use for their base, which also like... why are you not making fresh sauce at a Michelin Star Italian restaurant????And why could I not receive a fennel-free option of a lobster pasta? Who goes to a Michelin star restaurant to order a child size spaghetti and red sauce? I told them I didn't want it and asked if there was anything on the menu without fennel in it that I could have instead and he didn't seem to know. I asked if I could just have a side of vegetables or a salad or something that could come out quickly since my boyfriend already had his food. The manager was involved at this point and comes out about 5 minutes later with a plate of cooked mushrooms with a frisée salad on top haha. I suppose that's better than spaghetti..?They definitely tried to make up for it by sending limencello and an extra dessert to the table, but by then the experience was ruined and we were both pretty disappointed. Fortunately we found a great pizza place on the walk back to our hotel that made up for it!"
2392,"Good food, but not doing covid dining well. The inside was really crowded and when I asked the waitress why there were so many people, she said it was their 25% capacity. At least in my opinion the space (in which I counted over 55 people) looked filled way more than 25% and the tables were not six feet apart. Silverware wasn't wrapped and wait staff did not wear gloves. If you're concerned about covid spread I don't recommend dining here right now. That said, the wait staff was friendly, service was prompt and food was good. Under normal circumstances it's likely a better experience but for now there are better and safer places in Manhattan!"
2393,"This is my first time coming to Marea. As the flagship restaurant of the Altamarea group for coastal Italian cuisine, I was extremely interested by both the public accolades and words from friends and colleagues, some of whom have been going since the opening over a decade ago.  If I could give 4.5 stars I would. Hopefully, I don't come across as a picky snob, but I thought the meal was excellent yet clearly capable of improvements. I think it certainly earned its Michelin Star. However, I don't know about earning back the 2nd one it lost in 2019. I'm not an inspector, but think that I could still give some healthy constructive criticism.I went Columbus Day to a completely packed house. It was very difficult to make a reservation, so they're certainly doing a healthy amount of covers. We were quickly seated, taken care of with bread, and able to make our orders when we wanted. To start off positive, I will say that the crudo appetizers we all ordered were excellent. This restaurant certainly does a good job of highlighting the expertly sourced fish without complicating them with excessive amounts of ingredients. For our mains, we got some pastas (Fusilli with octopus, spaghetti with clams and squid, ravioli) and also the lobster and sea bass main courses. Again, I thought the seafood was incredibly fresh, expertly cooked, and aestheically pleasing. I'll also say that the fresh pastas (another public highlight of this restaurant) were all consistently cooked al-dente and worked to complement the seafood pairings very well.But I do have some criticisms. I understand that this is a busy restaurant, but our mains came out significantly longer than I would have expected after finishing our appetizers and first pastas (at least 30 minutes). We had clearly finished and were waiting for a good period of time.  I understand the crudos can be prepared super quickly and mains take longer, but when I'm paying top dollar, I would expect better timing on pastas and entrees (particularly with fresh pastas that cook within 60 seconds). That leads me to another issue. The prices are expensive and I'm not against that inherently. However, the spaghetti with clams and squid dish only had 2 clams (I guess that's better than one). At least browsing the other tables, at least I can say this was consistent. I understand I'm paying for fresh hand-made pastas, but there are many other places in the city that do this as well. It was also my understanding that in the past, a similar dish had a lot more seafood. So, I'm not sure of why it's more skimpy now. Raw food inflation? Lastly, I will say that the service was inconsistent.  I'm not trying to be too nitpicky, but the wait staff would often bring food or ask questions and leave in a heartbeat leading to some inattentivness. As a result, when we wanted our photo taken they missed our question and we had to flag someone else down. Then again, when we were finished with our food, it was inconsistent and timing between pick up and receiving the dessert menu was lengthy. I will say though that one of our waiters was extremely good and me just glancing at him was enough to make him instantly come and clear our appetizers when we were done without any of us needing to raise a hand. That was exceptional service, I just wish it was consistent. It's probably very difficult with so many staff, but I felt the need to point it out (Again when I'm talking about an expensive Michelin-starred restaurant).So all-in-all, I think the experience was really good. I thought the preparation and food was great and the service good at times. However, I can't say this was perfect because the service could be inconsistent. I also don't know how I feel about saying the food was perfect when there are other restaurants that also make fresh pastas with more seafood at 75% of the price (The Clam off the top of my head has a clam pasta loaded with more seafood). So what am I paying more for? I understand it's a seafood restaurant and it's going to be expensive, but I'm also looking at competitors. Am I paying for ambience? It's fine I guess. The music was light, happy and not too loud. The facilities were clean. The interior was pretty, but not spectacular. I don't know what they're ultimately going for here. It doesn't feel like the utimate fine dining experience in seafood and worthy of a 2nd star again. However, what do I really know? Maybe they're not even going for that anymore. Looking around, there were plenty of people in hoodies and jeans, businessmen staring at their phones more than at the food, and clear foreign tourists who wanted Instagram photos. It's obvious that their business model works and it's attracting swarms of people who want to go to THE seafood restaurant in town. It's a good place, but if you ask me, if all I want is amazingly sourced seafood, there are several other great options."
2394,"Fantastic dining! From the decor to the service and down to the food. The outdoor dining for COVID is very pretty and floral, and very well covered in case it rains. I love how our server thoroughly explained the menu and gave great recommendations as well as options we can do. They even automatically split the appetizers and such into two separate plates of our own.ASTICE - Nova Scotia lobster paired with burrata, eggplant and passion fruit was such a nice refreshing summery dish. Lobster was cooked perfectly and there was plentiful big chunks. Everything worked beautifully well together. Highly recommend this as a starter, this is a must orderPASTA - I loveeee the quadrotto ravioli with sweet corn and mushroom. It's such a light buttery dish, we preferred this over their famous fusilli pasta dish. Although we loved that one too. The fusilli pasta was perfectly al dente, tomato sauce was rich and flavorful. Their pasta is seriously done so perfectly. There's an option where you can order a half portion of both of these so you can try and share.ENTREE - we had the capesante which is a seared scallop dish which was yummy. However what was the true winner and stole the show from the entree was the roasted chicken dish. The chicken was so tasty, juicy yet crispy on the outside. All the components on the plate such as the corn and Tuscan kale complimented and made this whole plate absolutely outstanding. We normally don't order chicken at restaurants because their usually boring especially not worth it for the price... but you definitely CANNOT go here without ordering their chicken dish !!Come here for the pasta, pollo entree, watermelon basil margarita, beautiful atmosphere and fine service !!"
2395,"My boyfriend and I ordered takeout. Their takeout menu is like half of what they offer for dine-in. Too bad they don't have Insalata Di Mare.I ordered grilled octopus for appetizer and Capesante for entrée. I really like the sauce for my scallop, creamy and a bit sweet. I have to say the food is not worth the fame, but keep in mind taking out always degrades the experience."
2396,This Michelin rated restaurant was worth every penny. Cocktails over priced but delicious t appetizers amazingly delicious we had octopus and then meals for filling and satisfying. The portions we're not small and the service was excellent.
2397,"Although I loved two dishes (Fusilli-Octopus, Quadrotti-Chanterelle) absolutely everything else about our dinner was either mediocre at best to nightmarish at worst. Which is absolutely heartbreaking for me, to be perfectly honest. I only came here (with my favorite dining companion) trying to relive my glory days; back when I was too thin and too outrageous, I followed George here from Bouley Upstairs, and it quickly became one of my absolute favorite hangouts. Always at the bar, I came on dozens of dates, and frequently came here before many many concerts nearby. It was my jam, as the kids used to say. It's embarrassing watching someone try to be something they aren't, isn't it? Well, someone ought to tell Marea. Its glory days are over. Someone needs to put it out of its misery. It's literally falling apart. Worse yet, the food is low-quality and inconsistent and poorly presented. And the service was not just creepy and forgetful, but also found a way to haunt me for many days after my dreadful experience here. Because I wrote a discreet review of my awful experience on SevenRooms (the platform they use that nobody's heard of and doesn't have public restaurant review pages so there's really no reason they should have ever got so up on arms) they went so far as to call me tacky and trashy and ungrateful because I am a nobody who should have never been given a 7:30PM reservation which is for VIPs and celebrities only (go ahead and try to get a 7:00PM reservation, I dare you) but since they did me a huge favor then I should have just shut up about everything that was wrong with my experience. Except I met two of the chefs and told them that I was allergic to raw onions and raw garlic, yet the dish they sent me to apologize for all the heinous errors throughout the evening, guess what, it was swimming in raw onions, but precisely because I am NOT an ungrateful or tacky or trashy person, I ATE IT ANYWAY JUST TO BE POLITE. Also trying to be gracious and polite, I didn't send back my scallops which were sandy, my friend didn't send back his langoustines which were dry and rubbery, I didn't send back my escarole which was drastically undercooked, my friend didn't send back his turbot which was burnt, and I didn't scream bloody murder when our server poured a huge amount of sediment into my glass, making it undrinkable. I could go on and on and on, but sometimes it's best to just let things go. Like this place should. It's literally and figuratively a dump. Oh, and they banned me from ever again entering any of their businesses anywhere on earth! Which I find absolutely hilarious, because I've had the option to dine at their other restaurants many times, but always decided not to, because they're just not for me, and I guess they never ever will be..."
2398,This was our long awaited 11th visit and it was once again a true delight. We were wondering though how the menu might have changed since Michael Whites departure and aside from some slight alterations the menu was for the most part the same. The octopus fusilli in our option is still the best dish on the menu & the fresh fish served always is pristine. If there were a disappointment it would be that the arugula with lemon was not steamed as it previously was but rather now just a plate of raw with a bit of lemon squeezed on top. Overall though this still remains our favorite dining destination in NYC.
2399,"We celebrated our 9 wedding anniversary here on their outdoor terrace. It was a lovely experience that felt both safe and special. We started with drinks - cabin fever and an old fashioned. Both very much enjoyed by their respective drinkers. The complimentary bread was tasty- particularly the focaccia. Perfectly salty. We then moved on to the lobster burrata and grilled octopus starters. Both fantastic and great compliments. Then we had the fusilli and the gigli pastas. The fusilli is worth all the hype. Each taste of the sauce took me somewhere heavenly. The gigli was also very good, interesting and complex, but at that point, and knowing that we planned on dessert, I would pass on it next time in a similar experience. We had a side of pea leaves with the pasta. Nice little spice and crunch. Tasted very healthy and green - like a kale. Not delicious like a pasta, but a nice addition to a balanced experience. We finished with two cappuccinos, the chocolate mousse, and the strawberry fields forever. The cappuccinos were very good - perhaps the best ""restaurant coffee"" I've ever had. My wife enjoyed the mousse and I loved the strawberry dish. Each bite came together beautifully, from the crust at the bottom through the layers of jam, cake, and the mousse/hazelnut. They also gave us a complimentary dessert, described like a birthday cake, with ""happy anniversary"" written on the plate in chocolate dust. We were too stuffed to finish that, but took it home for the kids to enjoy. Serving size of everything is generous for the price point, as seems to be the norm with Michal White restaurants. They also took it on themselves to divide plates for sharing, which was excellent. Definitely recommend Marea. I've been wanting to go for a while and was not disappointed."
2400,"Definitely a diamond of a shop for how it bring unique NOLA style food in lower east side. Portion sizes are smaller than expected but full of flavor!Great price as well, got 2 sandwiches for $16 :)Check it out if you can!"
2401,"I really wanted to like Cheeky Sandwiches. I saw pictures of one of their sandwiches on a friend's Instagram, and he took me here to experience it. Got the pork chop sandwich ($8) which was super filling. Unfortunately the meat was dry, and the challah bread was burnt. Even my friend said that's unusual from all the other times he's been a regular.The interior is small and narrow with limited seating. Ordering at the counter is easy, and they're super fast because of how busy they get. The menu is clearly stated on their website and the wall. There are a few other things I'd like to try if I was in the neighborhood again, but I wouldn't go out of my way because of this initial experience."
2402,"Cheeky Sandwiches is a New Orleans-styled sandwich joint that serves a variety of sandos. the interior is a welcoming, worn-in, and has a quirky charm to it. there's one small table toward the front and a bunch of seats along the lunch counter. the space works well for solos, couples, and small groups. need a larger space for a bigger group? there are plenty of public seating options within walking  distance. the menu is mostly  sandwiches (the are some vegetarian options) as well as a couple of desserts choices. just soft drinks, no adult beverages...it's all about comfort food calories! despite being somewhat of a 'hole-in-the wall""--don't judge this book by its cover bc you will miss out on that NOLA experience in NYC.got the half and half po' boy--1/2 fried oysters + 1/2 fried shrimp, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, mayo (maybe remoulade), and hot sauce. this seafood po' boy definitely has the crunch of the fried seafood and crispy veggies. it is a nice mice of flavors from the seafood to the kick of the hot sauce. the french roll is nice and airy on the inside, soaking up the other flavors (though it is missing that crispy outside that most po' boys traditionally have). the po' boy is really small. wish Cheeky's used a wide and bigger french roll (size does matter, sometimes! lol) and stuffed it accordingly with more shrimp and oysters as this sandwich is gone before you know it. i would definitely pay more if they made it much bigger as it is a tasty, flavorful rendition of a NOLA po' boy. it costs $8.50 + tax + tip. the service is superfriendly and chill. the people who work here definitely have a nice vibe that resonates through this no-frill eatery. drops mic cuz i ain't a po' boy nowi outzzz"
2403,"How can you go wrong with fried chicken and gravy sandwiched between a biscuit?  The meat was tender and moist while still retaining the crunchy texture of the fried chicken on the outside. The gravy was layered enough to not soak the whole sandwich and was well seasoned. The biscuit is much bigger than the Popeye biscuits and definitely homemade, a bit dry but still good.There was also coleslaw but personally not a big fan of the sourish taste.The chicken sandwiches took a while to make but freshly made is the way to go! There were seats indoors with a small table by the entrance and some diner seats by the counter but also a table outside with some stools.Definitely a hole-in-the-wall kind of place; I would have walked by had I not looked intently for the store name.I did note that business does pick up later in the day so drop by earlier to avoid wait time! My friend also got the Ben Yad which was like big powdered sugar-covered doughnut bites. They weren't that sweet. I tried one and thought they were okay because it was pretty dense like bread instead of like cake."
2404,"Came here for lunch after a rough morning. Almost passed it, I didn't see it. Happy I didn't. I love the interior. Music bopping. Staff cheery. Beef sandwich delicious. I want to try the chicken and sea sandwiches next. Highly enjoyed my experience here. Made my day much better."
2405,"I have been dying to come here for sometime now, and i never made it. I had to pick something up in the Les and was super hungry so i decided to try them finally! At first i couldn't find it! I walked right past it. There was no signage of any kind to inform you that it was there. I was so annoyed at first cuz i kept checking the Yelp app thinking it was closed from covid (I'm glad they made it). So as i was on the block, i discovered its on the same street as sams fried ice cream! Yay! So because i didn't find them at first, i stopped there and just treated myself to dessert first... as i was going to leave, i decided to try and find it one more time. The Yelp reviews said it was in the cut (meaning hiding for anyone not from nyc) and then boom! Right next door to sams. I was sooo excited! I went inside and was immediately greeted by a worker. I ordered the fried chicken biscuit sandwich, and a bottle of water. I decided to sit outside and wait for my food in their makeshift outdoor seating, and the cashier offered to bring my food outside to me when it was done. Score! The chicken biscuit was sooooo good. The biscuit was nice and fresh and crumbly. But it held up well to the fried chicken breast that was seasoned to perfection, it also had pickled red onions and a pepper white gravy smothering it. Omfg!! The gravy!! Was just like the best topping! I'm definitely coming back to try them all because that one was amazing! They also included a free donut hole with my order! Score again! Don't give up if you're searching for this place. It's in the cut, but once you find it it's well worth it!! See pics below"
2406,"Service was amazing. Super friendly and checked peoples covid cards if they were dining in. There's counter service and a small table inside. We shared a chicken Sammy and she offered to split it in half for us. No hassles, always a plus. As we were waiting, I noticed stickers in the wall of the place and asked for one. She came out with a couple for us. Sweet place. And she gave us two complimentary beignets."
2407,"Oh my goodness, wow, unbelievable, amazing. Any of the proceeding descriptors would aptly describe the awesomeness of this little gem on the Lower East Side.A little hole in the wall of a restaurant that serves New Orleans style sandwiches deserves a Mardi Gras parade of its own. That is how amazing I found the whole experience. The Po' Boy that I ordered is perfect in every way. Perfectly toasted, perfectly portioned, perfectly seasoned, the seafood perfectly fried. I would have preferred more, as a great Po' Boy has extra seafood spilling out of it, but that would be nitpicking. I then got myself some beignets, and these as well were perfect. The perfect size, the perfect texture, the perfect amount, the perfect taste. Even the amount of powdered sugar added to the bag is perfect, and I come from the land of zeppoles, a close cousin to the beignet.The service is amazing, and the prices are absolutely outstanding. You get what you pay for and then some. I also found out they serve breakfast all day, sealing the deal for this overwhelmingly positive review. I guess you could say I am very chuffed, much less cheeky, with the results."
2408,"Stopped by here on the way home and ordered the beignets, fried shrimp, and fried chicken sandwiches.  While the portions were definitely on the smaller side, everything was absolutely delicious and I would say priced reasonably for what you get.  Shrimp was as good as any po boy I had during a recent trip to New Orleans.  Beignets were of course cooked fresh and were not exceedingly heavy.  Fried chicken was great, especially the biscuit it was served on.Owner/staff inside were super nice as well.With an area with a ton of food offerings you definitely can't go wrong stopping here for a bite."
2409,"Its definitely a hole in the wall.  You can miss it walking by. So pay attention to the address. Not a very big menu, but sandwiches were delicious. The staff was so pleasant and music was great. A must place to go grab some good food. I ordered the beef, pork and seafood sandwiches."
2410,"I shockingly (because I've lived abroad for the better part of the past decade) arrived late to the game of this gem in my native neighborhood.Since Covid hit ive been supporting all my locals spots and am so glad that I've become a regular since May. I have been going either every two weeks or every week and I am not even a sandwich gal but every sandwich made here is exceptional. The half/half poboy is hands down my favorite but the fried chicken one is their most popular, the BEEF one really is the most surprising because I dont eat red meat often.  When I decided to stop eating meat I thought how devastating but both the grass and the veggies sandwiches are solid! In conclusion go and get your grub on. Support black business owned."
2411,"Just visited this cute restaurant after three failed attempts at dining at other eateries in the neighborhood. The server behind the counter greeted me enthusiastically and helped me decide to order the braised short rib sandwich. The sandwich was so delicious and had lots of short rib. Plus, they gave me two complimentary beignets as a nice treat. Highly recommend for the food and the customer service!!"
2412,"Since moving out of NYC, I find myself missing this shop a lot. This has been my favorite chicken sandwich shop that I remember in NYC, and one of my favorites in my lifetime.It was definitely a small shop, but had a very fun charm and most importantly, tasted so delicious. The chicken was always crispy and hot, and the gravy/slaw/biscuit all went together so well."
2413,"Staff was very helpful and friendly. The chicken sandwich was amazing. Chicken was crispy, biscuits was fluffy and gravy was flavorful. Definitely a great value meal."
2414,"Everything on the menu is great. The egg sandwich and chicken sandwich, both on biscuits, are my favorites."
2415,"Oyster po boy is delicious!! A bit spicy, so make sure u can handle the kick. Small hole in the wall w good music playing. Not a huge fan of the chicken sandwich I don't see the hype w it, it's a bit hard to eat but I wouldn't describe it as dry"
2416,The short rib Beef Sandwich and 3 Pieces Ben-Yay's were absolutely delicious. Unfortunately I was in the middle of my tour but I can't wait to order when I'm off work and can completely enjoy their amazing food It was full of flavor and hit the spot!
2417,"Truly the definition of a hole in the wall restaurant. The vibes were great, the staff was extremely kind, and the sandwich was good. I got the chicken and gravy biscuit. I think next time I would order something different but the biscuit was amazing and I will definitely be going back."
2418,Foods amazing. Had Fried Chicken Sandwich and the oyster. Both were delicious. The fried beignets were great as well. Definitely a must try hidden gem.
2419,No doubt the best chicken biscuit and gravy sandwich ive ever had. Staff is very sweet & efficient. Same high-quality taste as the last time I was here in 2019!
2420,"Been coming here since I was in high school and it's still fun as an adult. Great food, great memories. Don't expect elegant dessert - it's meant to just be a fun experience. The sharing fondue gives a campfire vibe. Definetly a great friends outing for chocolate lovers or even a date spot. The dessert can be heavy, so come hungry!"
2421,"I finally made it to Max Brenner! Usually when I go to bars I get something to eat, but I had eaten previously, so I just had the drinks! First let me say the wait staff is very professional and attentive!  The bartenders work hard for their money, I was tired just watching them! I ordered the white chocolate Russian first which was delicious, it took a while to come, but their was a female there that I believe was a manager, and let's just say watching her made it worth the wait! I finished with the latte which was also good! I will visit Max Brenner again!"
2422,"This is purely a review of the hot chocolate. I stuck to the original milk chocolate with marshmallows but you can choose from milk, white or dark chocolate. It's $6 for a small cup but wow, so good. Definitely a treat yo self kinda drink but hey, you deserve it!"
2423,"Lots of space and a fun/evening ambiance with lots of people and great service. Unfortunately, the flavors just didn't do it for me. I ordered the Baked Cookie Dream (giant cookie in a skillet with vanilla ice cream): looked cool, but tasted very much like a very overpriced mall-style chocolate chip cookie with very basic vanilla ice cream."
2424,Savory food was surprisingly good -- we got the fettuccine pasta and Brenner burger. Good portions and definitely filled us up but wasn't outstanding or anything (but we came here for the chocolate so no big deal)! But the chocolate was delicious of course. We got the Crystal Churros fondue with dark chocolate and my boyfriend whose usually a milk chocolate lover really enjoyed it too :)
2425,"The service was horribly slow. Ordered a medium to medium well burger and got a very well done one, also had to cancel the shake ordered because of how long it took to arrive to the table."
2426,"Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. This place is neither for the faint of heart nor the health nuts. Max Brenner slaps you in the face with sweet treats that are decadent and rich. My guest and I came here solely to try their desserts; they are not as well known for their food menu. After watching countless YouTube videos and reading tons of reviews on this place, we settled on the Marshmallow Hot Chocolate and the Infamous Chocolate Chunks Pizza with The Works. The desserts were slightly on the pricier side, but definitely not a dealbreaker given that this place is mainly for the experience and not a regular option. As for service, we got our food in a timely manner and our server was polite and welcoming.Marshmallow Hot Chocolate - Honestly, I was a bit disappointed with how this turned out. The ""hot"" chocolate was served lukewarm at best and the flavor was lacking. The beverage seemed watered down and was not as rich and creamy as I expected it to be. I do love the concept of the hug mug, but the beverage not being hot really drew away from the full experience. The marshmallows on top were a nice touch and paired nicely with the hot chocolate. That being said, this was nothing special and was a disappointing start to our duo of desserts.Chocolate Chunks Pizza w/ The Works - I was super excited for this one and it looked amazing when the waiter brought it out. The pizza was extremely picturesque; the toppings were laid our evenly and the peanut butter was generously spread across the top of the pie. The taste met my expectations; essentially the sum of its parts. What's not to like after biting into marshmallows, peanut butter, and chocolate?? Anyway, this dish was definitely a hit and was not sickeningly sweet (which I was worried about).Overall, I'd say my experience here was pretty average. I'm not sure if my hot chocolate was an anomaly, but it sure seemed very off-brand compared to the general ambiance and environment of Max Brenner. Even with the pizza, I wanted to be surprised by a bit more; the final product seemed like anyone could make it given the right ingredients. I'd recommend making a trip here only for the pictures and experience."
2427,"My wife was super excited to come here for her birthday. She'd been here several times, but I never had. She raved about the Mac and Cheese (with tomato sauce) which was pretty good, but I wanted something more substantial, so got a burger which was fair at best. Cheesy fries were tasty but nothing extraordinarily special. We got what appeared to be the signature dessert, which again was fair. Its a good thing the brownie had all the other stuff on it, because without it I think it would have been relatively dry. By far the best thing we had however (even on a hot July day) was the hot cocoa (we got the peanut butter). It was amazing and that alone (or other varities) would get me back here in the future."
2428,"Excellent service on a busy Friday night. We enjoyed the Buffalo chicken pizza and the Cesar salad, both very good but the dessert stole the show. The dark and milk chocolate was excellent and we loved toasting marshmallows. The toffee sauce was great as well and the brownie, cookies and fruit were perfectly paired. Such a fun spot for kids and a must try when visiting NYC."
2429,"Visited this spot twice in matter of two weeks - once w a friend (Thursday) and another time w coworkers (Friday). Both times the place was packed, service was awesome and food was just as great! They have a great selection of desserts but I'm not a sweet tooth person. However, did hear great stuff about desserts from others who love sweet. I just had a chocolate shake which was absolutely delicious (feeling nostalgic for the good old days).For the first visit, I had the grilled salmon which was delicious.  My friend enjoyed the burger just as much. Fries where super tasty and spicy aioli was to die for!  Oversized burger and sauteed onions cooked perfectly.  Mango frozen lemonade was super sweet but very tasty.  Chocolate ice cream with fudge was fabulous.  That was of course after he remedied the hilarious hiccup! (we asked for a small scoop of chocolate ice cream and it was served in a small sauce bowl-check out the pics). Thankfully, our waiter fixed the mishap quickly! Second visit, everyone had different items for the menu including myself (I had grandmas pizza) and none of us were disappointed. Maybe I'll come back again just to try the desserts :"
2430,"The deconstructed latte A very interesting concept. This consists of a shot of espresso in the first glass, some steamed milk in the second glass, full latte with beautiful latte art in the third glass. Additionally, it comes with some sparkling water to drink in between each cup that you try. The barista explaining the concept of it was a very nice touch. Again a bit pricy at $8, but very nice presentation and just a cool thing to try. Ethiopian blend pour overWasn't anything unique, and is definitely a bit more expensive than the average pour over at $8. On top of it, they serve this $8 pour over coffee in a $2 ikea glass. Would be nice if this coffee shop found some local artists to purchase glassware from. Especially at this price point. The serviceOverall nice service, but we had come here from a bagel shop that ran out of seating space and had hoped to eat our bagels with our coffee from this place. Sadly the staff told us they do not allow any outside food.They have an interesting no laptops no tablets rule. Might not be for everybody, but I respect the attempt to create a more interactive space in their coffee shop."
2431,"Really loved the Affogato 10 out of 10 would come again. Only downfall right now because of Covid, is that they are not doing their deconstructed lattes which is why we went in the first place BUT I heard that they will hopefully bring it back soon since that is what they are known for."
2432,"Lovely hole in the wall, quick and friendly service.Got the nitro flight and the deconstructed latte, both fun to try. This is not a place is recommend to study but maybe meeting up with a friend or starting your day here. I did not try the drip so I cant rate the coffee but the service was super nice and the ladies there were not snobby at all."
2433,A short review...so far my favorite coffee place in the city ;) i need to come back for the special coffees! good job guys
2434,"Happy to score a table late Saturday afternoon for cafe society. This place has been on my radar for ages and not for the deconstructed latte. I was happy to see all of the black coffee options. I rarely get to enjoy a pour over and todays didn't disappoint. A pour over is a true coffee luxury. Went with the Mexican with its medium body and light acidity. Some light fruit notes, more like fresh, bright notes with a chocolate finish. Leon said his hot chocolate wasn't hot enough. Love the ambiance, efficient and chill servers. The ambiance is quite energetic. Glad I live close enough to make it here on the rare occasion I enjoy a coffee out."
2435,"Found Coffee Project NY on yelp and saw that they had an item on their menu called the ""Deconstructed Latte.""The Deconstructed Latte consists of 1 shot of espresso, 1 ""shot"" of whole milk (no milk substitutes for this menu item), the latte itself, a waffle cookie, and a glass of sparkling water to use as a palate cleanser. The Deconstructed Latte is only available for order for those who are sitting at a table; it is not available otherwise. A barista will bring it to your table and give you directions on the recommended approach to drinking the deconstructed latte and a little background information regarding the espresso itself.This is the first time I have ever come across such a menu item at a coffee shop. 10/10 would recommend. Service was fantastic, latte was great, and the overall atmosphere was very inviting!"
2436,"Just when I thought there is nothing new in coffee I stumbled upon this place and it's deconstructed latte concept. I'll get back to that in a second.The place is very small, most likely geared towards to go orders. They had a lot of people coming in on a Friday at noon. There is extremely limited seating, but somehow we managed to grab 4 seats at the bar. They were having some problems with the grinder as it required a dial in after every shot for some reason. Because of this our drinks were delayed quite a bit.We opted to go with the deconstructed latte. You basically get half a shot of espresso, ~50 ml of steamed milk, a small latte, a wafer and a glass of water as a palate cleanser.The espresso had a great smell with a very well rounded taste. The milk is something else. They told us that they partner with an upstate NY farm that uses low temperature pasteurization to increase sweetness. I called BS in my head, but I was wrong, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. I steam a lot milk at home for espresso based drinks and I tried all the kinds I could get my hands on, but I've never had anything this sweet. I now wish I would've asked for some cold milk to see how the sweetness compares to what I know.The latte (being a pairing of the two) was of course really tasty.I enjoyed the experience and I encourage you to come and give this place a try."
2437,"We were trying to find a cafe in East Village area and found this place on Yelp. This place is small but they do have a few tables and stools near the window.Staff (barista) was very sweet and kind - he explained the details on coffee we ordered, and coffee tasted EXCELLENT!We tried:* Nitro coffee - loved it! Reminded me of Guinness. * Nitro flight - for those who want try different flavors.* Ginger elixir - I believe this was one of the award (challenge) winners. My friend liked it but it was too gingery for me.Tips:*no card minimum.*not recommended for a big group.*no laptop during the weekend."
2438,"As a coffee lover, this place hits the spot. Ambience, service, and cappuccino are all up to my standards."
2439,"Just like any others talk about this place. And yes about deconstructed latte. . I would like give one more info I came in on Monday. The front for parking will be free all day or the next couple days after 10:30am. Before that time in Monday just be careful about ticket for sweeping street. $8 for the deconstructed latte. And everything is just hospitable. I can tell people love here. It's nice little business. Guess can name it ""the soul of the 2ND AV""."
2440,"I pass this coffee shop most days on my commute. After my first visit here today, I may just have to start waking up 5 minutes earlier to add it to my weekday routine. (And budgeting an extra $5 a day into my currently modest coffee expenses.)Coffee Project is best known for its deconstructed latte, but on a warm and sunny day I needed something cold and to-go. Thankfully, they have quite a few iced options, including a cold brew and tonic. I went for what sounded like the most interesting, the Ginger Elixir, and also one of the more expensive options at $5.75. Ouch.The price set a high bar for me, and I'm pleased to report the drink passed it. Who would have thought that seltzer and ginger syrup would have been the perfect foil for coffee? Not too sweet, not too spicy, just balanced and refreshing, with a healthy dose of caffeine that didn't make me bounce off the walls. Simply delightful. This goes in my coffee hall of fame, which includes La Colombe's draft latte, Miscelanea's coffee horchata, and All Day Miami's Sweetheart No. 4.The staff was extremely nice and with-it. I felt truly welcomed even through only two brief interactions. It was also pretty quick in and out despite being in the middle of a weekend afternoon. The only knock I can think of against Coffee Project is that the space isn't ideal for weekend work as they have a no laptop policy then.Will certainly be back!"
2441,"The deconstructed latte alone is worth the price of admission.One of the most unique coffee drinks I've had anywhere. You get your espresso served separately from low-temperature steamed milk and a side of sparkling water. Drink in order of how you're instructed, and enjoy the magic.You can also get normal coffee and espresso drinks, but where's the fun in that?"
2442,"I'm basing this review on the Nitro Flight. The nitro coffee was good, but for $8, I expected something a little more. More coffee would have sufficed. I do enjoy the coffee, but I'm not sure I would really recommend the flight; a regular nitro coffee would be a better value. Also, through no fault of its own, the space is pretty tight. There are about 12 seats, but, given the popularity of this space, things can get tight quickly. That said, the baristas are very friendly and willing to make your visit pleasant. Taste: 4/5Portions: 2/5Price: 3/5Atmosphere: 2/5Service: 5/5"
2443,"I came for the deconstructed latte but stayed for the ambiance, staff, and excellent coffee. Known as Project One, the deconstructed latte ($7) is exactly what you think it is - a latte that is broken down into a three-glass flight. The progression goes from espresso to milk (from a local creamery, pasteurized at a lower temperature to resemble the flavor of raw milk while still being perfectly safe to drink) to a beautiful, fully assembled latte. A glass of sparkling water and a wafer accompany these glasses on a wooden tray that is brought to your table by the barista, who explains the flight in detail. The reason for this deconstructed project is to take the time to sip the individual elements of a latte and recognize the flavor layers. Located in the East Village, Coffee Project New York is the project of Chi Sum Ngai and Kaleena Teoh. Ngai actually trained in Portland before moving to NYC. This coffeeshop serves up everything from espresso, drip, pour-overs, to nitrogen cold brews and even coffee alternatives like hot chocolate and even misugaru (a Korean roasted grain drink). If you don't want a deconstructed latte but like the idea of a flight, they have a nitro flight that is dine-in only. Hungry? They have scones, croissants, Kouign Amann, muffins, and brownies.Aesthetically, it's warm and inviting with earthy tones and exposed brick. The atmosphere is calm and evokes a sense of community. The baristas are all extremely knowledgeable in the art of coffee-making, and they are so friendly. I am excited to come back and see what new projects are up their sleeves!"
2444,"Love this spot!I stopped by yesterday morning for the deconstructed latte. You get an espresso shot, milk, and then a separate latte. Also comes with sparkling water and a delicious waffle cookie. The person who brought over my drink made a suggestion on how to taste each drink and in which order. It was really good and a fun way to have a latte! It was $7, which is reasonable considering a regular no-fuss latte at Starbucks probably runs close to $6."
2445,"I came to Coffee Project to try the deconstructed latte. It was a wonderful and unique experience for me. I've never seen this on any other menu before the Coffee Project! As a first timer, it was so helpful that the barista brought it over to my table and explained the process of how to drink it. She explained what each thing was and the purpose of it all. The milk is also locally sourced, she mentioned. It was delicious and fun. 10/10 recommend for the experience. The coffee shop is small with few tables. I wouldn't recommend this place as a ""stay for a couple hours to work on laptop"" -- in fact, I think they have a polite sign that says to be mindful / not hang around for too long with a computer. Makes sense, for a small shop that has a lot of foot traffic!"
2446,My favorite coffee shop in New York by far the best pour overs known to man in the city. From my personal top 5 coffee experiences this place holds 2 spots. Recently went to the shop had an amazing pink bourbon pourover. Bought the bag worth the price. Friendliest staff around John was very friendly helping me on the register and keeping the coo flowing while Peace made pour over so great knocked my socks off. After every sip I had to scream out fuck Because that how good this fucking pink Bourbon is.
2447,"Why your coffee gotta be so popular and live in such a tiny space?!  Classic good coffee spot problem.  The pride here appears to be coffee selections of single origins so your taste buds can travel to Columbia, Nicaragua, or Mexico more fully.  If you're a barista-time-sucking-pour-over-snob, you may need to wait 8min before they can even begin your pour-over request because of that line of 10 people behind you waiting for a simple pre-made take-out cold brew.  Thankfully, because they know you're willing to wait, they push you aside until they've knocked out that line first- and in the process they save you from everyone else in the tiny cafe sending you angry hate vibes for hogging the barista's time for your damn-fresh-pour-over-cup.  Bitter? Me? Maybe.  The coffee?  Much smoother and less bitter."
2448,One of my faves in Manhattan and worthy of a visit each time I visit. Low key coffee coffee digs.
2449,"TLDR: There's a latte here that will get you the most Instagram likes you've ever had. And it's super delicious!______I came here for one reason and one reason only.... the Deconstructed latte.Granted. I don't know if I was a local if I'd be getting this every day, but as a tourist I sure as heck was going to.Starts with an espresso shot.Then milk...that's been pasteurized at a lower temp. It's weird to say one milk is better than any other, but this was the best milk I've ever had. Didn't even taste like milk that I've had before.Then the latte. They mentioned all the notes I'd taste but I just tasted a perfect latte hat was creamy.Also got a little round bite that was cakey and had custard inside. It was a delight to nibble on while I went on the journey of my latte.Overall they are using great coffee and obviously taking special care when crafting their drinks! Check them out!"
2450,"I was finally able to get a reservation at Minetta Tavern which I was very excited for. I've been hearing they hyped about the burger so I had to try it. The service was great and we were able to get outdoor seating. The reason why I gave it 3 stars was that I wasn't that impressed with the burger, especially paying $34. I didn't think it was worth it....Things I ordered:- EAST COAST OYSTERS with black pepper, shallot mignonette- BUTTER LETTUCE SALAD with Gala & Gold apple, Marcona almonds, honey/cider vinaigrette- BLACK LABEL BURGER with selection of prime dry-aged beef cuts with caramelized onions and pommes frite (medium rare)"
2451,"minetta is a mainstay for me and my sister. Black label burger, minetta burger, steak for two are our go-to. The bone marrow is amazing as an appetizer to share. If you like dry aged beef go with black label. The oysters were super fresh and amazing last time we went (one week ago). I loved the bib lettuce salad which possibly was new? We went for brunch and I had the eggs Florentine which was amazing. Overall, A+. Classic NYC vibes and great food. OnlyComplaint right now is that they could bring the jazz music outside so you get more ambience for COVID street dining."
2452,"Minetta Tavern was everything I hoped it would be and more. It's tucked away on a corner in the west village and a true gem in the neighborhood. Service was wonderful. The black label burger was easily the best burger I've had in my life and well worth the hefty price tag. Can't wait to come back and try something off their dinner menu! Also, order the coconut cake you won't be disappointed!"
2453,"Obv a very popular busy place. Had a reservation. Was seated fairly quickly in a nice big booth BUTThe service-aloof, unfriendly or personable as if they were disappointed we weren't old rich men? IdkThe food-I love steak frites for special occasions so got this. Med-rare. Steak was dry, flavorless, rubbery and tough. Sooooo disappointing (not cheap) didn't enjoy a single bite of it and my poor boyfriend had to listen to me complain about it. Drinks-fine Atmosphere-very Old world NY-super cute Would NOT go back."
2454,"If you walk pass this place before all of the outdoor seating was set up, you'd probably think was some kind of bar with a nice corner location in the west village. and it is a bar. and a French bistro meets NY steakhouse. Came here for brunch and the prices are not for the faint of heart. But why are people willing to pay $25-$32 for a brunch entree or $19 for a cocktail? It's because this a truly classic nyc dining experience. Unlike other places that become famous and stay famous in name only, MT prides itself on great service. The customer is made to feel welcome, the seating is classy and comfortable. The staff is personable. Is food like the black label burger excellent? yes, it is a truly unique and tasty creation. Is it worth $30 plus? hard to say, but it is the sum of the parts that makes this place special. Worth visiting."
2455,Been coming here for 12 years as pre jazz dinner -last nite starter escargots and sweetbread in pastry -horror of horrors it comes out cold -I was mortified as being placed in A position I've never been in -had to send it back -so embarrassed almost making excuses for them but nonetheless they produced another along with effusive apologies and a wine top off and it was fantastic -next comes my (medium ) veal chop and it was (I was aghast not for them but forMyself as far as what I had to do ) RAW -literally raw in center with a nice crust on outside -must have been placed frozen into double broiler -I was so embarrassed as I've NEVER sent one plateLet alone two back  .Meanwhile the waiter with his fake French accent starts arguing with me over my surgical dissection of the chop chiding me that this was indeed med rare forgetting 1 that I ordered it medium and 2 that anyone who ordered rare would have sent this back for being undercooked  !several other servers came over inspecting the plate and concurred with him that it was indeedMed rare -maybe they thought there were different standards in France ( and there are ) but I wager none of these  rubes  ever set foot in France and I certainly have many many times and know how to order taking into account national peculiarities -they made a (negative ) fuss and reluctantly brought me another (perfectly cooked ! ) and I have to say one of the finest veal chops I've had right or left bank .Finally we went to the bar for post -prandial (on us of course ) cappuccino and wine  -the response between returned starter and entree was bipolar -they couldn't have more as toadies first and then genuinely annoyed and arrogant that I dared send a piece of raw meat back .very disappointed as I grew up in the restaurant bus (washing dishes and bussing ) and I KNOW how hard and exacting itIs and had to send TWO platesBack for the first time ever and then get insulted for doingso (the second) -speechless
2456,"This was a bucket list visit for me.  We visited for lunch and were sat in a fun corner booth overlooking the restaurant.  Service is impeccable.  From the host to the wait staff.  Such a warm, old-school vibe.  The bread, fresh butter and coarse salt was a treat to start.  Cocktails were good. The Caesar salad delicious. The black label burger was ok, but did seem under-seasoned.  The fried were good & plentiful.  Our only regret is that we both got the burger and didn't order anything else for one another to try.  We will certainly be back, as it's beautiful, welcoming and quintessential New York."
2457,"After finally getting a Reservation on Resy for a Friday night, came here expecting to be blown away. While we did enjoy our dinner, I found myself a bit underwhelmed.Service was 10/10 - we absolutely loved our waitress who gave us great recommendations for the cocktails, which were great - but for $19 each that's what you would expect. I got the white rabbit which was like a skinny, light refreshing margarita, and my fiancé got a whiskey drink. We also split a bottle of wine over dinner.They start you off with fresh warm bread, butter, and salt which was nice. Since we didn't love the appetizer choices and have always been curious about aligot (a $12 side) - we started with that. It was just as expected, creamy, cheesy mashed potato's with an interesting texture. While it was good, we could not eat more than a few bites as it's very rich. For entrees, my fiancé ordered the steak frites ($42) , which were very good, but we've had better for less. Intrigued about the new menu item, Lobster Thermidor, the waitress suggested I order that instead of the black label burger. While it was good, I found it too rich, and without any sides to balance that richness and buttery seafood flavor, I again couldn't eat much of it. Seeing that I regretted not getting the black label burger, my waitress swapped it out without me even asking, which I thought was so nice because I would not have even mentioned it. When the black label burger arrived my fiancé and I agreed it was the best burger we've ever had. Worth the $38 price tag? Possibly. The bacon onion jam was delicious and it certainly didn't need cheese or any other condiments. Out of everything we tried the burger was the winner for sure. The steak and burger come with a heaping amount of fries, which neither of us could finish. I find it interesting that these entrees come in a huge portion with an abundance of sides, but the rest of the menu lacks portion and sides. Will we return? Probably not with so many other amazing French NYC restaurants out there with better price points. Our meal came to $250 for two people and I left feeling underwhelmed. I am  glad we came to see what the hype was about, but I think this place is a tad over rated."
2458,"This is for delivery... everything we ordered delivered well. Even the bone marrow was still hot (thank goodness because cold bone marrow is so gross). We got a Minetta burger, Brussels sprouts and pappardelle. It was a feast for 2 people. Everything came still hot and well put together. Everything tasted as yummy as does when we dine there."
2459,I only took 2 pics. We were 3 people sitting outside. We started with moules frites. This was a very tasty dish. We shared as an appy for our group. I loved the cream sauce and we asked for no garlic. Still very good. The frites were also crispy..The fish special was grilled and the fish itself was tasty... however... there was way too much pepper on the skin. Thank god we could remove the skin. It came with nothing on the plate so we ordered string-beans and salad. Those were good. My husbands steak frites was done perfectly and the cut of meat was nice. He mentioned an 8 out of 10. He thought too much salt and Peter Lugers was better. The lobster roll was tasty and had too little lobster in it for the price. Still... a delightful day to enjoy lunch outside.
2460,"Im glad restaurants are up and running during Covid. B side and few more in the corner have combined their menus. This has its pros and cons! Pros: you get to order nachos and pizza at the same place..Cons: hostess didn'tknow if the other half of the street had table for two and was sending us back until a waiter found us a table! The service wasn't great, we placed our order online and had to keep checking it with a server who didn't stop by our table for the first 30 mins. Food was mediocre..pizza was ice cold so had lost its taste, veggie nachos was not bad and was a bit unique as it had friend artichokes! I would still go for the pizza maybe only if they can serve it hot!"
2461,"I'm surprised B-Side doesn't come up more when people are talking about the best pizza in NYC. There's a lot of pizza places all over the city, but B-Side is one of the very few that doesn't just have excellent pizza but  is also a nice sit-down restaurant where you can spend a couple of hours and enjoy your time. I really like the vibe, the music is nice, the staff is pretty welcoming, the whole place seems like its built of polished wood with the pizza oven being the centerpiece - the source of energy for all the pizza worshipers gathered around.The Killer Bee pizza is killer indeed, sopressata instead of pepperoni is a nice twist - I really like the thick big piece of sopressata they put on there.PS: I visited before COVID and sat inside, will be going again soon now that they have outside seating."
2462,"Found this place on an Infatuation list one night. We tried the killer bee and the carbonara pizzas, they were both delicious but the killer bee was the standout. I am a vegetarian and my boyfriend is not, so we did meat on half of each pizza. The dough was light and fluffy and the sauce has great flavor for both pies. They seemed to have a good beer selection as well. They mostly have bar seating with a handful of high top tables. They do also have heated outdoor seating. The servers were great and made good suggestions for us."
2463,"Have a group of friends meeting for dinner and cannot decide one type of food? This place is perfect. You basically get to order from all three of their restaurants on and around 9th Ave and 51st Street. We started with the steak nachos and they did NOT disappoint. The margarita flight is a great way to try their many different flavored margaritas, might I suggest coconut cayenne? And, honestly their pizza is some of the best pizza I've ever had, definitely in NYC. Full of flavor, excellently baked and very satisfying."
2464,Really Good Pizza ! Really Great customer service as well . Would recommend the Killer Bee and you got a lot a balls .
2465,"A week earned five stars for both delivery and indoor dining! I'd ordered pizza delivery from B side in the past and was impressed with the texture of their dough, quality of their sauce, and the fast turnaround time. Tonight, I had the good fortune to visit in person! My aunt had just broken her fast and was craving pizza. I picked B side since its close to home and right off the E train as well.The service that we received from Nancy at the door, and Chris at our table, was second to none. They were attentive to our every need and really looked after my aunt. The food was delicious and we had the added bonus of being able to order Mexican as well from 'Ritas - had never realized that was an option. Guess both places teamed up? Either way, we were happy!Fresh Guac, perfectly grilled veggie quesadillas, two amazing pies, and the black kale salad was incredible. My aunt loved it so much that she'll make the trip into HK just for this!Killer playlist, plenty of social distancing even inside, and definitely a place that I'd return to on a date.Special thanks again to the kitchen staff for they attention to detail, to Chris for being a great waiter in every way, and to Nancy! For managing both entrances in an orderly and efficiency manner! What a great night!"
2466,"You cannot visit NYC and not eat pizza. I am a major pizza lover!!! I've been to NYC a few times so I really wanted to try a different place than the usual tourist spots for pizza. I did some research and came across this place. My favorite pasta is carbonara so when I saw they had a carbonara pizza I was sold. We got there right when it opened so we were seated right away. They had indoor and outdoor seating. I ordered a glass of wine and the carbonara pizza. My boyfriend said he wasn't hungry. When the pizza arrived he quickly changed his mind. We both took a bite and fell in love with this pizza. Hands down one of the best I've ever had and I eat a lot of pizza. It was just perfect. The pizza was so good we decided to see what else was on the menu. I realized this place is a gem!! It had a great pizza menu and Mexican menu! Pizza and Mexican in one place who can ask for more?! So we decided to try the trio tacos. They were also good but nothing compared to our pizza. I also want to add that they had a great cocktail menu. They even allow you to create your very own drink! Super cool spot!Overall, definitely recommend!!!"
2467,"Great place for a delicious and quiet meal! Wonderful wine selection and lovely ambience- you can actually talk at a normal volume! Servers were very attentive and kind! We had the brussel sprouts and burrata appetizers and both were bomb! Really fresh and flavorful! And the pizza was thing, not soggy- really tasty!"
2468,"I was excited to try this place out since I live nearby and I always see lots of people sitting outside for pandemic outside dining. I decided to order takeout / pickup through their website (online platform Cheqout). My main issue with this was the platform stated that they would text you when the order was ready for pick up, and although I received a confirmation that I placed an order, there was no text that the order was ready. I called the restaurant an hour later and they said my order was ready, but the pizza was beyond cold. I would suggest that they better integrate their online ordering or use a platform that gives you status updates on your order.What I liked about it was that you could order from both b side and ritas through the same platform and there was an option to basically remove anything (toppings, etc.) from the food if you have dietary restrictions. The pizza (Killer Bee) was pretty good after reheating, but there were a lot of really burnt pieces."
2469,"Hurrah for outdoor seating!  The pizza at this spot in the theatre district is excellent.  I'm surprised I hadn't heard of this place before!  Super crunchy crust with really fresh generous ingredients.  I also had a margarita, which was made well.I saw the inside of the restaurant is very cozy when I went inside to use the restroom.  Also it's very clean inside.  Our server was really friendly too!"
2470,"very good! cant wait to go again! wish was it bit more seasoned but you can always add yummy stuff on top, great portion sizes; bigger than anticipated but not huge, worth the money and experiencing something new :)"
2471,Veselka is incredible on so many levels Not only because of the well loved food and staff But also their dedication and involvement of supporting Ukraine
2472,"Went to support a Ukrainian restaurant helping support Ukraine through the horrors now unfolding there.That Veselka is legendary is no real surprise, the food is incredible and very authentic. Something as simple as borscht doesn't seem like it could be unique but it is so good there that I wanted more. But I still had kovbassa, pyrohy, and holubtsi to get through. Everything was delicious and it was great to not feel like I'd eaten too much and needed to walk all the way home.Make sure to leave room for deserve too, medovyk is especially delicious.Smachnoho!"
2473,"The last time I came to Veselka was pre-covid, after a night out in East Village - I remembered the pierogis in particular being delightful.My recent visit was pretty disappointing in comparison. A promotion was being run whereby 100% of borscht proceeds were being donated to Ukraine. To support a good cause, my friend and I got a large bowl. The ingredients used were good quality but it tasted bland and under seasoned  (a theme for all food that night).This was also the case for our order of the stuffed cabbage, albeit the portions were huge (it came with a side).I got the 68th bowl (mixed peirogis). I opted for fried - they were bland in taste and incredibly oily (I had a little pool of oil in my bowl after I finished). The texture of the dough was lovely, but again sad that seasoning was off. Our waiter was very charming and attentive, so at least the service was good. It might've just been a bad night for the chefs. I would be willing to give it another try but not if I have to go out of my way for it."
2474,"When it comes to food you would have in a Ukrainian home, this is right on the money! I have a Ukrainian background, so when I tell you this place is authentic, I know what I'm talking about (at least I like to think so). While I wasn't blown away, this is because I've been eating food like this from birth until I moved out (and now when I visit). As you can probably guess, this place also has some stiff competition! Hard to compete against what mom makes, ya know. Thus, five stars are very good food, plus points for authenticity!I ordered a Deluxe Meat Plate with a cup of Borscht for my main, and had the blinz plate for dessert. The Borscht was hearty while still maintaining balance. The ingredients within were cooked perfectly and very tender, especially the meat. The soup itself had great flavor which was accented by the herbs up top. Where it comes to the meat plate itself: the pierogi were good, but I honestly prefer them fried. Even though they were a little plain, the condiments provided help add some extra dimensions. the grilled kielbasa was exactly as expected. The stuffed cabbage though was remarkably executed. The cabbage itself was cooked perfectly - it was soft, thin, and kept the filling together. The filling itself was simple but pleasant (beef and rice, I assume). The mushroom sauce meanwhile was tasty without being overpowering and tied everything together. As for the blintzes, these were thin, gently sweet, and filled with a similarly pleasant and sweet farmer cheese. Pouring the fruit on top added a fresh note and just a little tartness. Oh, and a quick note across the board - We add sour cream (technically ""smetana"" - less sour and a little tangier and sweeter) to everything. Try it, or go all in and embrace it. Crepes with sour cream isn't weird at all!"
2475,"Glory to Ukraine, and Ukrainian food! Veselka serves delicious and filling food, in a homey ambiance. The short rib pierogis are so tender and juicy! The short rib melts in your mouth when you bite inside the pierogi. The thin, chewy skin holds it all together in one yummy bite.The potato pancake plate comes with a lot of food for its price point! I chose beef stroganoff and chicken noodle soup as the sides in my combo plate.The potato pancake reminds me of a hash brown, but thicker, crunchier, and more luxurious. The exterior crunchy texture and the interior soft fluffy potato are a great textural contrast.The chicken noodle soup is very light! The soup is flavorful, not greasy, and tastes homemade. The chicken is tender and pulls apart by the tendrils easily.The beef stroganoff is very rich! The mushrooms break up the thickness of the beef. The beef itself is also extremely tender and soft. It's surprisingly not too heavy, eitherI can't wait to return and try more off the menu!"
2476,"This restaurant is amazing !! I've never had Ukrainian food before, but I was so happy to try it out. I came here on a Friday night with my mom. It was a bit crowded, but understandably so, as now's a great time to show support to this business ! The line moved up pretty quickly and we were able to get seated right away. The decor was cute as well.For starters, I ordered the Matzo Ball Soup, which was delicious. For our main courses, my mom and I ordered the Fried Short Rib Pierogi, Potato Pierogi, Cheese Pierogi, and the Potato Pancake Combo Plate with Veal Goulash. The food was so flavorful and cooked perfectly. I had to order seconds of the Short Rib pierogis because that's literally how good they were. The pierogis left me wanting more in the end and I was very satisfied. For dessert, we ordered the Medovyk cake, which had a very soft texture and tasted freshly made.Overall the food was reasonably priced and the service was great. Can't wait to come back here and try more items on the menu. Highly recommend checking it out !"
2477,First time trying Ukrainian food & it was so good!! The pierogies were yummy & reminds me of chinese dumplings! Love that it came with different fillings & the one we got was short ribs & it was good! The beef stroganoff was also so unique & yummy. Didn't have overwhelming flavors & perfectly seasoned! Definitely worth the visit & has earned it's popularity!
2478,"40 years a dedicated go to for the best of Eastern European food. Mushroom barley soup is awesome, indescribably delicious, a healthy and satisfying meal.Pierogis are handmade in house and the meats are all locally sourced@The East Village butcher shop across second Ave."
2479,"Really, really solid Ukrainian food. Ordered the mixed meat platter on a cold rainy day and it was the perfect comfort food.- Borscht (5/5)- Potato Pierogi (4.5/5)- Beef Pierogi (4/5)- Cabbage Roll (3/5)The Borscht was INCREDIBLE. Probably one of the best I've ever had. Super flavorful and rich- and the beef in it was tender and oh so soft. Only wish I got a whole bowl of this. The pierogis were both delicious as well, although there was maybe a little too much wrapper for my liking. The cabbage roll was okay, but the filling wasn't super flavorful. Would love to come back and try the rest of the menu!"
2480,"What can I possibly say that hasn't been said in the thousands of reviews prior to mine?! It's obviously a great slice of Pizza. I'm all for the grandma/square type of pizza. If anything, this is for the staff. I'm sure you're yelling out hundreds of orders a day and that you get tired of doing so from time to time but it does go a long way to make a customer happy when the line is 40min and any additional minutes on top of that is torture having to wait simply because one couldn't hear you calling out the order. I drove specifically from New Jersey to Brooklyn, to your place to try the pizza and I was handed a lukewarm slice because I didn't hear the order being called out. I'm sure there's much to be said about me for not paying attention after 30+ min waiting - but simply install a speaker and the problem is solved (o:"
2481,"I grew up in the neighborhood and went to Difara before they were famous. I knew Dominick and he made a great pie at that time too. When he made his new pies with 3 types of cheeses great olive oil, Basel and oregano. The pizza was the BEST I ever tasted. I hardly went there the past few years cause I'm getting too old to wait a long time. I was there a few weeks ago and Dominic (I think has retired) I ordered my favorite square and one triangle. I was very disappointed. However I ordered the square pie which I loved at one time. My wife and I ate a few slices. It was dry and didn't taste good at all. We threw out the rest of the pie. My days at Difara are gone. Bye Dom."
2482,"I left a review. Not sure If there are 2 DiFara pizza in BK but the score was 3.5. Plain slices were phenomenal. I could eat one a day. They had a very unique taste about them (in a great way). The square pie was a big letdown, especially for the hefty price tag. The pie was burnt, no other way around it. It wasn't charred or well done. It was burnt and that burntness gave it a very unpleasant bitter taste. Next time we are in the neighborhood, we will try the squares as slices and not a pie. Di Fara as an NYC institution and you should make your way over at least once. ENJOY!!!"
2483,"#143.9This spot is a cult classic and was on the bucket list. Line was not bad as we went when the opened at noon.Amazing slice, but not the best NYC slice for me. Great ingredients and the fresh basil is a nice touch. The slice cracked which is a must for me. Great balance of sauce and cheese. I did feel like the crust was very different which may be why everyone loves this slice. Enjoyed the crust but felt like it was a little more dense than it should be in almost a focaccia style way."
2484,Went here once because of a friend's recommendation. We paid $28 for a regular pie with basil that tasted like any other pizza (this was many many years ago it's prob gone up now). Don't get the hype.
2485,"Regular slice was my fave. Crispy crust, good ratio of sauce to cheese to crust. Square piece was also good with more sauce than the regular. Basil was prominent on these slices, so it wasn't lacking flavor."
2486,"DAMN! That was my exact reaction biting into this pizza at Di Fara's. I'm not sure what it is but they do something to the thin crust pizza, along with the sauce, and the basil? on top that makes it so good!! I was blown away with how good it was after the first bite. I had chosen to add sausage on top and it was definitely worth it! Make sure to grab a slice if you want the best in Brooklyn!"
2487,Solid pizza but definitely not worth the wait and hassle (wait and journey). Crust is thin and holds the sauce and cheese. Add Fresh garlic and basil makes the pizza pop. If you're around and don't mind waiting a minimum of 45 minutes then maybe a must. Overhyped press and definitely been to better establishments closer or within Manhattan. Expensive pizza...over $30 wo toppings. The pizza actually tasted better the following day reheated in a pan with butter. Definitely a one time adventure for me.
2488,"I have heard rave reviews about this Brooklyn hotspot for years--so I decided to venture here today for lunch--I I was able to call ahead and pick it up. I was late, but nonetheless, I still received a warm pie.The pizza was a little on the salty side but otherwise, it was perfect. I'm not sure if I want to venture all the way to Midwood, deal with a one hour wait and pay $30 for a pizza pie, but if I'm nearby, I'll definitely return here."
2489,They have excellent pizza but the down side is when it's delivered because I live in dyker heights it comes so cold from Uber delivery it still tastes good cold but I wish it was semi warm if it wasn't over an hour wait for pick up I'd choose that option but don't have the time for that hence the 4 stars
2490,"Why would I give Trattoria Trecolori two stars, when my guests and I thought most everything was delightful?  It was because of my strip steak.  I asked for it to be cooked very rare.  It was not, and the waiter took it back to the kitchen.  I don't know why, it wasn't as if they could cook it any less.He returned with the cook's answer that it was the rarest they could cook the meat.  First of all, that's not true.  I've cooked meat, and I've been to better restaurants than Trecolori, and know it's possible to have it rarer.  If it were a question of it needing to be a certain temperature which precluded it being served very rare, I should have been told when I ordered it.  But somehow, I don't think that's the case, since they serve thinly sliced raw beef.So I tried a bite.  I should have quit sooner.  It was hard to cut, because of tendons or ligaments.  My friend offered me her steak knife, but that didn't do it either.  I carved around the stuff I couldn't cut through, and put a piece into my mouth.  And I chewed it.  And chewed it somemore.  And finaly swallowed it, thinking it just was not going to get any more tender.The meat was substandard and should never have been served.  And it should have been taken off the check when I complained about it the degree of doneness and they didn't offer me other one.So, I asked them to wrap it up, because I wanted to take it home.  For my dog, I added in a slightly raised voice.And as soon as the money is deducted from my debit card, I'm going to put in a claim with the bank for $32, the price of the steak. Otherwise, the drinks were great, we enjoyed the Tavola Tricolori, the lamb chops, the veal chop, and the pastaccio tartuffo.And Eli, my dog, found nothing wrong with the steak."
2491,Stopped here for drinks at the end of the night. Service was excellent and the outside seating was perfect. Right by Times Square.
2492,"Sooo happy we stopped at this restaurant. This cute restaurant is tucked away in the busy area near Time Square. The service was fast and the employees were very polite and kind.  The food was ""UHMAZing"". One thing is the bill will add up quickly lol, but it's worth it."
2493,"The rigatoni I pasta was good - 5/5. Very flavorful and good portions. A bit overpriced but good nonetheless.Strawberry G&T was also good - 5/5. Good pour.The desserts were what really brought down the review. We ordered the tiramisu and the chocolate mousse cake and both were terrible. The tiramisu was too dry and the chocolate cake was overly sweet with not enough of that ""mousse"" creamy taste. 1.5/5 for the desserts. Would not recommend."
2494,"Food was excellent,  staff very pleasant and accommodated us quickly without reservations on a Sunday.  Will definitely come back again."
2495,"Absolutely loved it here. I did a search for best Italian near me and found this gem. Squid ink noodles are one of my favs and not a lot of restaurants I've been to have this dish on their menu. I was ecstatic. Tasty, savory, and generous on seafood portions. Every bite was perfect! I'll visit again soon. Thank you for the perfect afternoon lunch!"
2496,"Our 4th visit over the past few years.  This time we sat outside and our wonderful waiter was Carlos.  We had the special, a cheese ravioli, on the recommendation of a friendly regular sitting at next table.  Drank Old Fashioneds, served up, the way I like them, and they were excellent."
2497,"Outstanding service, outstanding food. Clean, staff was great and happy.  They do not rush you"
2498,Great food with excellent service. So glad we found them. It was within walking distance of our hotel on 45th and the Schubert Theatre. The salmon and vegetables were terrific and we shared a wonderful tiramisu for dessert. Will go there again the next time I'm in NYC.
2499,OMG!!!  I mean so delicious. Vegan options. I had Veal Marsala. Went for my bday. Pricey but you get a lot of food!!!  Ambiance so nice.
2500,"Cafe Mogador reigns superior! This is a quicker review because I normally will order on DoorDash for lunch or dinner. It's a quick healthy option that is ALWAYS delicious. My go-to order: Chicken pita wrap (chicken, hot peppers, cucumber, tomato, hummus with a side of spicy sauce and tahini) with a greek salad. I also like to order the hummus and another a la carte for the week (eat it with chips or pita etc). It's always packaged neatly and ready to go. Delivery is pretty quick too! They've become that reliable restaurant for Greek eats when I'm craving it. I haven't ate at the restaurant in a while now that I live on the other side of the pond but I always suggest it when friends come from out of town and want to eat somewhere fun for dinner. It's delicious food, good portions and not too pricy. Always impresses :) Great neighborhood too, right in the heart of EV!"
2501,I went here with a group of friends and have a medical condition so I had brought a little bit of a side dish with me. The waiter stood over me and said we don't allow outside food. I said I have a medical condition.I complied with the policy but the waiter stood over me no watched me to make sure I did it. He stood there lingering just staring at us and made All Three Women at the table feel Uncomfortable. The managerThen came up and didn't apologize she said that he was just doing his Job. she then said you guys want to getThe check and leave. I felt unwelcome and also not accommodated. Do not go here. IfYou want to feel welcomeIn a resteraunt this is not your spot.
2502,"This place service is not the best. It has been here for quite some time so people come here but honestly service is not great. Our app came then after 15 min drinks then in the middle of app our entree came. Second time we explicitly asked the hostess to seat us outside. She said 15 min wait. After 1 hour she seats us inside and then the most appalling part was she gave us attitude as if we are wrong. It was the one with curly hair. Anyway I have been waitress so I get it. But come on dont give customers attitude if you're too dumb enough to not understand how to do your job. If brunch shift is too much, work slow nights. Swearing off this place for good good."
2503,"Bring back the steak, cowards!Use to come here once a week. They removed the steak and haven't gone back since."
2504,"Stopped by here for late breakfast on a weekday after my yoga class. The place was fairly full for the middle of a weekday, but not overly crowded. I was able to snag the last small outdoor table, which is a well enclosed structure. I had a cappuccino and the middle eastern breakfast. Everything arrived very quickly. That cappuccino was one of the best I've ever had. The zaatar pita bread was soft and warm, the tabouli salad was so so good. I'm always reminded by how simple and yet delicious an Arabic salad is! The total came to about $25 with tax and tip, which I thought was plenty reasonable. I will definitely come back and would recommend for breakfast!"
2505,"I came to Cafe Mogador for dinner with a friend pre Omicron and this was my second time here and her first.  We ordered Moroccan mint tea, the calamari appetizer, matbucha (tomato and garlic mezze) that came with pita, lamb tagine and meatball tagine.  To be fair, I'm not a fan of lamb so I'll be using my friend's input for her take on her meal.I greatly enjoyed the hot tea since it had been getting cold out and we were seated outside.  The tea had a lot of mint in it so this may not be for you if you're not used to drinking tea with loose leaves.  If you don't mind and like mint, then go for it!  The calamari was grilled and stuffed with couscous.  There were some tomatoes and herbs sprinkled in as well.  Flavor wise this was enjoyable enough though there weren't too many pieces in total (around 4-5).In her words, ""the lamb was delicious. The lemon preserve and olive sauce was quite good and different. The lamb was super tender and buttery. I'd give them like a 4.2 or 4.3. A very solid choice for good hearty food.""  She did feel as though the couscous could have had more sauce though.  The meatball tagine unfortunately wasn't quite the same experience for me.  Though there was no lamb in the meatballs and the texture was fine, there was plenty of sauce but the meatball itself was a little dry and the meld of flavors was not to my liking.The matbucha was a recommendation from our waitress and that was delicious!  Usually we get hummus, babaganoush or labne when we eat Mediterranean together but we wanted to try something different this time.  It was a tomato spread made with garlic and oil (and potentially red peppers).  When paired with the pita, the garlic and tomato came through in each bite.  The same way that bruschetta works well, so does matbucha, though this is far less crunchy and a much softer bite.Overall, if you're a fan of lamb this would be the place for you.  If you're like me, I'd consider getting the kebabs since that worked out better for me the first time.  The matbucha is a must!  They have plenty of other mezzes that you can choose from as well if you'd rather have a greater assortment of options."
2506,"This place has been on my list to go for a while now! It was snowing on a Saturday morning so I thought this would be the best time to go, and indeed it was. We get there and were seated immediately. Service was great and the restaurant was super cute. I got the Moroccan mint tea, and it was so soothing and fitting for the weather. I loved the strong mint flavor. For my brunch entree I got the Sabich. It was good, but not the best I've ever had. The eggplant could've been cooked and seasoned more. All around I think the sandwich was lacking some flavor comparatively to others I've had. I would want to go back and try some of the other dishes in the future but I'm not dying to go back anytime soon."
2507,"A stable brunch spot to check out at least once! This brunch spot is honestly really cool looking and it kind of reminds me of Morocco because of the similar decoration items they used here and the ones they have at restaurants in Morocco. I got the Eggs Blackstone which is good but nothing that amazing about it. It's what you would expect of a typical brunch plate with poached eggs, bacons, english muffins, green salads, and roasted potatoes. If you're looking for a new brunch spot or just haven't check out this place yet, it's definitely worth it for at least a one time visit."
2508,"I've been here twice: the first time was several years ago for a weekend brunch and the second was just last night for dinner. I can't remember the brunch experience very well, so this review will be about the dinner instead. We came here sorta late, around 9:30pm so there was no wait for a table for two. After checking our IDs and vaccination cards, we were seated at a table in the back. Now, I love ambience as much as the next person, but the lighting here is super dim so be prepared. I ordered one of the tagines: the lamb casablanca which was raisins and caramelized onions, with a side of couscous. So good! I'm not normally big on lamb, but this was so tender and literally fell off the bone. My boyfriend ordered the bastilla, which came with a side salad. I got to try some of his, and it was delicious. For dessert, I got a creme brûlée as I'm a huge fan. It was good, but the temperature was uneven so some bites were warm while others were lukewarm or cold. I'm only docking one star because of the service. I think our waitress left halfway through our meal, so there was someone else who gave us the dessert and check. He seemed to be the only waiter in the restaurant with at least 5 tables, so things were a bit slow towards the end. But I would still come here again and recommend it - the food was so good and I love the neighborhood."
2509,Malawah!! Brought me back to my childhood. Not your average brunch. Tons of options that give a little extra umph because of the Moroccan / Mediterranean flair. Food 12/10. I was kind of annoyed they only serve whole milk and oat milk?? Two very polar sides of the spectrum. So if you don't drink regular 2%+ milk you're obviously forced to get oat milk which they inform me would be a 2-3 dollar up charge. If you're going to serve only one alternative please don't charge it. I don't even like oat milk it's the most unhealthy milk alternative lol. C'est la vie. Definitely coming back for the food but grabbing coffee elsewhere beforehand.
2510,"What an outstanding brunch! My wife and I met my daughter on a Saturday afternoon at this restaurant and had such a great time. Love the neighborhood, very nice decor, and service was attentive and friendly. We started off with drinks and the Halloumi cheese appetizer. The cheese, tomatoes, and onions, served with delicious pita bread was excellent, and went well with my Coney Island IPA. For entrees, my wife ordered the Country Breakfast (she loved the labne), and my daughter and I ordered the Middle Eastern Breakfast with poached eggs. The meal was fantastic! I especially loved the hummus with pita bread. If you're in the East Village, give this Moroccan restaurant a try, you won't be disappointed!"
2511,"Visited on Sunday during lunch time. Wait was about 30 minutes. The street is blocked for pedestrians. Outdoor seats were available on the street. It is packed and crowded, so expect some wait time. They check vaccination card and id. Food is amazing! 5/5. There are lots of middle eastern restaurants in nyc but this restaurant is one of the best. Meats tasted really great! Very flavorful. Turkish coffee was very interesting. I have never tried it before. It was great! Warning, very flavorful with different spices. It does not taste like a normal coffee."
2512,"I walk past Cafe Mogador almost on a daily basis, but this time Rozena and I went it to verify whether it is as good as the reviews say it is. And the answer is a resounding yes.The decor is fantastic, and works well for a romantic dinner. I like the display of North African items on the walls, coupled with dim lights. The service is very good, as well. We ordered an item off the special menu, which featured a chicken with a creamy yoghurt sauce (comes with a spicy -- not so spicy, actually -- basil sauce, naan, arugula). It was delicious and we wanted more! The lamb shank Tagine comes with rice, and the only complaint was that the rice wasn't sufficient for two to share. Otherwise, the lamb itself is fantastic! I love how it easily it slides off the bone. The meat is tender and full of flavor, and so, this is a dish I highly recommend.Will be back soon, for sure. Perhaps, for brunch!"
2513,A quaint spot a few steps down off St. Mark's that has a great selection of tasty Morracan flavors w/ a fitting playlist to boot. The staff is wonderful by the way. Emma and Robin were pleasant and very attentive. Will definitely be coming back.
2514,"It was pretty crowded when we got here on a Friday night, but we did not have to wait too long. Really enjoyed the food here, especially the Falafel, that's definitely my favorite, try it and you won't regret it. We also ordered the Moroccan Tagines Chicken. Can't wait to go back again."
2515,"Get there early or you will be waiting in line! Had no clue this place was so popular... and even local East Villagers are seen flocking to this place. Imagine a quaint, authentic, traditional moroccan restaurant infused with the flares of East Village and hipster-ness: that's Cafe Mogador in a nutshell.Their food is delicious and very high quality. Their halloumi dish is well baked with za'atar, olive oil, diced peppers and onions. Their vegetarian couscous dish is a mountain of raisins, sliced vegetables and chickpeas blended in well flavored couscous. The plates themselves are not presented fancy nor elegant, but you will leave here feeling full and satisfied! Besides, the restaurant is well situated, less than a block away from Tompkins Square Park making it a nice stop through your trek in the bustling East Village neighborhood."
2516,"I had a very positive experience eating lunch here. Our server was upbeat and friendly, so that was a great start. I'm not much of a tea person, but I absolutely loved the Moroccan mint tea. Our food was delicious - both the chicken kebab, tagine, and hummus mezze were bomb. Everything tasted so fresh, the only thing that could have made this better would be more veggies with the chicken kebab."
2517,"Seating and restaurant as a whole is so cute(: I million plants!!! Pita bread and drippings were yummy. The hummus was more on the flavorless side and the bean flavor was strong! Personally, I would've liked more flavor but everyone has their preferences.I ordered 10 minutes before pick up, and it was ready so fast! Yelp said it would be ready at 12, but by 11:40, the food was ready to go!"
2518,"The food is good, but a bit overrated in my opinion for the wait time. I want to come back for brunch because I think that's where a lot of the hype is around. The salmon cous cous was very flavorful, but not the best salmon I've ever had. The interior is also a bit noisy which left me with a headache when leaving. Will be back to try again, but I think brunch and happy hour might be better than dinner."
2519,"Great experience! I ordered the lamb tangine in the choloulla sauce. The lamb was cooked well and the sauce was delicious, and the side of couscous paired well. The Turkish coffee was also one of the best that I had, including compared to those in Turkey. Service was great as well."
2520,"Cafe Mogador is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I have been here many times over the years. The food is always consistent. The falafel, hummus, tahini, and lavender are always great starters. I love the chicken kebab as a main and the side salad. There tends to be a wait for a table so come early. The pita is made fresh and comes out warm and is hard to stop eating."
2521,"Stopped here for brunch with the girls on a Sunday, at opening there was a line to get in. We got a table immediately but by eleven, the majority of tables around us were filled. We ordered Moroccan Mint Tea to start, it came with an entire pot and cups with fresh mint. We couldn't finish it. Our appetizer was the hummus platter with falafel. The hummus platter came with schug and two pita breads--there wasn't enough bread for the three of us, but the platter was delicious all in all! I ordered the Moroccan eggs without the meguez sausage. It came with pita bread, two poached eggs, and the spicy tomato-pepper sauce. I thought it was delicious! They don't give a spoon though, so once you run out of bread to dip it in you're kind of left helpless. Friends ordered the country breakfast and French toast. They loved their meals as well. All in all, we mentioned we would come back when in the area for brunch."
2522,"this restaurant is awesome!! staff/hostess was very friendly and attentive, and the food was amazing. we ordered:-hummus and falafel platter-babaganoush -labne yogurt sauce-lamb shank tagine in an apricot sauce-mixed grill with grilled sausages / chicken skewers-fries w harissa ketchupmy favorites were the hummus/falafel platter, the pita and dips, and the lamb shank tagine. OMGGGG that lamb is soooo good. the apricot sauce they cook it in is AMAZING and the meat is fall off the bone. i will come back many times!"
2523,"Wow I loved Cafe Mogador!! This place has been on my list for a while and I finally stopped by for dinner. I started with the watermelon cocktail, which was super refreshing but super light on the alcohol unfortunately. Hummus was the first thing we got, and it was solid, nothing too spectacular. I did like how they gave a very generous portion of hummus. As for entrees, we got the Kefta Kebab and Chicken Tagine. I really enjoyed the flavors of the kebab, which were served with veggies, pickled red caggage, and a yogurt sauce. I've never had a tagine before but loved how tender the meat was! Cous cous was a great complement to the tagine as well. I'd for sure be back and try out the other options here."
2524,"Ordered for delivery via uber eats. The estimated delivery time is like 50 minutes so I ordered ahead of time for delivery later. The order came on time to the estimated. It was nicely packaged in plastic containers and the side dishes were packaged separately from the main dishes.Food:Lamb shank tagine (with Casablanca sauce- chickpeas); had cabbage and couscous on the side in separate containers. Lamb was falling off the bone and sauce was plenty-couscous soaked the sauce so it was yummy, nice dip in addition.Mixed grill: the mixed grill came on a bed of rice, the rice had a smoky flavor from the grilled meat. There was a lot of meat- two chicken skewers and another skewer of roasted peppers, the meat quality was good and can really taste the grilled flavor. Overall really liked the way the different dishes are very distinct in flavor, good balance of protein and grains / vegetables. Good quality but was a bit pricy ($29 for the grill and $27 for the lamb)."
2525,Been eating at Mogador for years and it's always been deliciousOrdered seamless for a family of 7 and the food was just as good as in person dining.  I highly recommend.
2526,Came to Brooklyn to attend a friend's art show. Decided to stop by this place for a bite after the event as it was close to the event space. We waited a bit to get sat. It's a cute establishment with low lighting and a casual ambiance. I also love the use of lots of plants within the place. I ordered the special which was salmon and it came with a side salad. I enjoyed my meal a lot. Service was also very friendly and attentive.
2527,"Came in last week with a friend. Wasn't the greatest experience. They have very few tables (there were 5 when we were there) and so we had to wait for a few minutes when we first got there. Only about 10 minutes which wasn't bad. We went on a Thursday around 6, so I can't imagine a day that's more crowded! They just don't have the space. Our waitress was really hasty about taking our order and we felt rushed. I got the chicken couscous and my friend got the hummus and falafel platter. The couscous was very underwhelming. Not very food. My friend said the hummus and falafel were good though! When we were wrapping up, our waitress was literally hovering us to take the check. We felt so rushed. My friend hadn't even finished her food. The a guy who I guess was waiting for our table was standing right next to us staring at us to get up. Just really annoying. So not a great experience."
2528,So so good! Clearly all the great reviews are we warranted. Came here by recommendation from a friend and it did not disappoint. All the seating outside was full so we decided to sit inside. The tables were well spaced and ventilated. We started off the meal with the spicy chicken wings which had the perfect amount of spice and the yogurt sauce that came with it was the best combo. I ordered the lamb shank (fall off the bone good) and my friend got the Merguez sausage. You will not be disappointed if you come here.
2529,"TLDR: lovely little cafeHad a great time eating brunch here with some friends. Cocktails were stiff and tasty and the food was excellent. Service was fast, would come back again!"
2530,Service is slow but food is pretty good. Cute indoors and I recommend the mint lemonade! Everyone where's a mask
2531,"Tagine, Tagine, Tagine, TagineI'm begging of you please don't take my manTagine, Tagine, Tagine, TaginePlease don't take him just because you canYour juiciness is beyond compareWith flavor profile that knocks you off your chairWith couscous soaking up the juice, so it seemsOne bite is like a breath of springYour the meat is tender like summer rainAnd I cannot compete with youTagineHe talks about you in his sleepAnd there's nothing I can do to keepFrom my mouth watering too when he calls your nameIG: @globaleatsinnyc"
2532,"I came into this place (doesn't take reservations & expect a bit of a wait) excited for a different type of Mediterranean food, and it delivered. The Turkish coffee was poured out of a small steel bottle, and the regular eggs breakfasts had a great blend of spices to it. I ordered the Malawach, which was billed as a Yemeni flatbread, but pretty much was a paratha with a few different dipping sauces. I don't really know what I was expecting, so while I was a bit underwhelmed, it was delicious. I would come back here to try some different stuff."
2533,Cool spot for date night vibes. The chicken kebab entree is my fav. The drinks were delicious. AJ was our server.
2534,Was recommended this place by a friend and always make it a point to visit anytime I'm in Brooklyn. The hummus and eggs are my favorite!
2535,"My friends brought me here as a local favorite, and the food and ambience are really lovely. I got the sabich plate and realized that I don't love hummus quite this much, but it tasted clean and healthy, and the eggplant was good. My friends enjoyed their food and then we also shared a pot of mint tea. We had a hilariously awkward encounter with our server but he was otherwise very good and we had a great Sunday morning here."
2536,I've been twice. Both times were busy. They don't take reservations so come early. The first time I just got pita and hummus with a cider. All was good. I came back a different day for lunch and got a falafel pita. That was yummy. It's too bad it's only a lunch thing. I would come back if in the neighborhood but it's nothing too special. The French toast the people next to us were eating looked and smelled great.
2537,"Cool little place, was immediately sat on a Thursday night. We had the hummus and pita to start, which was disappointing - generally not great. Then we had the lamb, which my dad appeared to enjoy. We also ordered a Manhattan and mojito and they were strong pours! Waiting staff was very nice, generally a nice meal!"
2538,"I truly enjoyed this authentic Moroccan restaurant that I had accidentally stumbled into and good thing it was early because it had filled up shortly afterwards.They place is very cozy, and in the background they play light  French music and the occasional Moroccan jams. It wasn't gaudy or expensive feeling it was the perfect middle ground of what I love in restaurants.The service was alright nothing extraordinary and things came out quickly which was great.   My party and I truly enjoyed the mint tea and babaganoush which came with naan but we also order roti with it as well. Then we had the lamb tagine with Casablanca sauce another one with chermoula sauce, chicken with chermoula sauce, and mixed grill with assorted meats. Everything just hit the spot perfectly!For dessert we got the baklava and knafeh to top the perfect starters and dinner.High recommend this place for everyone!"
2539,"Chill brunch spot recommended to me by a friend. Great food, great service. I'd definitely go again"
2540,"Oh my. Yelp did us right on this one. Some of the best Mediterranean food we have ever had, with that Moroccan spice flair. We got Moroccan iced tea, lemonade, halloumi, Greek salad, hummus, and the mixed grill with kefta, chicken, sausage, and grilled veggies. It was all so amazing!"
2541,"My restaurant week pick up order of chicken tangible was FANTASTIC. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and moist. The accompanying cous cous had an excellent chicken flavor. I loved the hummus! It was a very comforting, filling meal especially on a super cold day. Glad I learned about this restaurant through the restaurant week offerings! I will now become a regular! Definitely recommend!"
2542,"I was nervous about finding a table here on a Saturday at 11am (since you can't make reservations) but surprisingly, there were still tables available.  My friend didn't come until 30 minutes later (I was annoyed) but I was able to find a seat at the bar and have a cold brew while I wait.  At 11:30am when my friend finally arrived, we were seated immediately.Having 30 minutes of wait time means I had plenty of time to go through Yelp reviews and see what I should eat.  I had the Moroccan Eggs with a side of Merguez (sausage).  My friend had another entree with hard boiled eggs (I can't seem to find it in the menu).  The food was amazing and reasonably priced!  I will come again!"
2543,The best effing falafel of my god damn life. It is crunchy and fluffy and falls apart. I refuse to order falafel from any where else ever.
2544,"I ordered the lamb shank tagine for brunch and super enjoyed it! It was super tender and beautifully seasoned. Everyone at my table enjoyed their food as well, I liked the tomato sauce in the Moroccan eggs as well. The hummus was popular too. The restaurant itself is really nice and cutely decorated. The music was a fun mix of the Beatles and Arab music. We saw a few famous people (VS model and a famous Insta illustrator). Was a very pleasant brunch, would recommend! And they have a covered area to wait if the wait is long, which was nice on a very cold NYC day."
2545,"The decor, music, service is 100 percent for me maybe plus I like my date lol. I got Moroccan mint tea and he got mogarita to drink. Moroccan fish cake as appetizers and organic blackened chicken for entree. So yum will definitely come back feels like local gem restaurant."
2546,"Their hummus is delicious.I got the middle eastern breakfast and my bf got the chicken tagine. I liked mine better lol. The hummus was amazing. I've never really like hummus from restaurants before, but this one was sooo good. The zahatar pita and side salad were also delicious. I would come back and just order the the pita and hummus because it was so good. The tagine was alright, I though it lacked flavor and the chicken was a little dry. Overall solid for my dish, my bf's on the other hand was just okay."
2547,"My wife and I decided to get brunch here and boy were we impressed. The service was great and the location has really nice outdoor seating since it's on a relatively quiet street. The foods the real star though, we got a middle eastern breakfast with sausage and it's so juicy and flavorful, absolute recommend it! The halloumi eggs was also phenomenal and you should also get that as well because YOU'RE worth it. Come here if you want to have a nice casual breakfast/brunch with nice ambiance with delicious and unique cuisine."
2548,"Fabulous restaurants, good food, friendly and attractive staff. At 2pm on Friday afternoon Cafe Mortgagor was a little bit busy and f you get the chance to visit and try the Moroccan cuisine you'll understand why!This place was teaming with a mix of trendy singles, young families, yuppies, and well coifed senior citizens. Located in the Williamsburg part of Brooklyn, Café Mogador is the quintessential hip Mediterranean restaurant with leafy green plants, a garden room, and Beatles music playing the background. It's family friendly, so expect lots of baby strollers. The place is really nice comfortable looking with many plants on the back.The food in this restaurant is amazing. Great flavors... They have outdoor and indoor seating. Tables are a little small. It would be nice if they offered hooks, to hang your purse so you don't have to put your purse on the floor; because it definitely doesn't fit in that small table. The service was ok. The waitress was a little snooty at first, maybe because we had asked to move tables. But after we ordered the bottle of wine she started warming up to us. She offered us a tasting of the wine which was a good thing because we were ordering a bottle. We chose the Grillo that went very well with my lamb with Apricot and prune sauce. The Arabic salad was so delicious! I definitely could eat a big plate of that alone!!My friend ordered the Tagines chicken Casablanca (chickpea, raisins and onions) and I got the lamb with apricot and prune sauce. I'm not really a ""lamb person"" however, this lamb was out of this world! The meat was so tender and fell of the bone. The flavors were amazing. Right combination of sweet and savory. The Tagines chicken was good, but my lamb was delicious! Next we ordered the chocolate souffle which is perfect if you don't want an overly sweet dessert. It has the right amount of sweetness without being overpowering. I would like to come back and try other stuff in the menu, but I might just end up ordering the lamb again. Definitely worth the visit.We had a really nice and delicious lunch."
2549,"My friend and I stumbled upon here on accident but I'm glad we stopped by. We were just looking for a quick breakfast before work and they did not disappoint. We came in around noon on Tuesday so it was a pretty chill and relaxed environment. Service was great, everyone was very attentive and kind. We got the Morracan eggs and french toast. Both were delicious and I would recommend both for anyone looking for breakfast food!!"
2550,"I tried the pink velvet cookie with frosting and sprinkles. It was a really good, slightly chewy cookie. The cookie went really well with frosting and the crunch of the sprinkles was nice. It was also huge, I split it with another person and we still had leftovers."
2551,"City cakes is a beautiful open air bakery. Once you walk in you can see right through the cake decorating area of the bakery, which is fascinating to watch them at their craft. They have a beautiful display of all the desserts they make in house. From huge cookies, pretty cupcakes, to perfect cake slices, and slices of pie that look to die for. So far my favorites have been the dark horse cookie. It's a deep chocolate cookie with a sprinkling of charcoal fleur de sel. It's crunchy on the outside but still remains soft on the inside. It's perfect when you warm it up and pair it with a glass of cold milk. The red velvet is one of their filled cookies and it's so spot on! It's my boyfriends all time favorite. If you haven't tried their ginger cookie and are into ginger, I suggest you give it a go. It's the best ginger cookie I have ever had. Perfect ginger flavor and the best crunch from the sprinkles. They rotate some of the flavors of the cookies out and some of them are gluten free for those that have an intolerance. The tarty party cookie with fruity pebbles is my new favorite. Perfectly balanced, not too sweet and has a great texture to it with a lemon curd filling YUM. The staff is also super helpful and very sweet. They make insanely good lattes and always offer their suggestions if needed. If you are in the area this is always a great option. I know I'll be ordering a cake from them for sure, edible art at its finest!"
2552,"Came here for a Yelp Elite event!We got to cheese a cookie and a slice of cake, Emmy bf picked out the double chocolate cookie with chocolate frosting and I got the Nutella chocolate cake. The double chocolate chip cookie was really delicious, especially warmed up like they suggested though I do think that the icing was a bit too rich combined with the cookie. The Nutella cake was good too, more moist when heated up than eaten cold, however the cake again like the icing was a bit too heavy and sweet for my personal taste-I more prefer sponge cakes with a whipped cream icing. However if you're craving something rich and decadent, I would recommend checking this place out!"
2553,"I came here for a Yelp elite event. I must say Ot was a wonderful experience. So frost the lady who assisted us was amazing. We got a chocolate cookie and I must say; it was too sweet for me. Now this is my opinion but I was not a fan of it. Now the cake was amazing and it made me rethink my cake place. I got the confetti cake which was delicious, so soft and airy. They had the right balance of sprinkles and the frosting was not overly sweet. The bakery is also beautiful and the service was great. The cakes inside are beautiful and are truly works of art. I would definitely go back and try more of their items."
2554,"Since I was here two years ago, I have rescinded my 3 stars because their cookie game is back full throttle (this isn't related to them also moving locations). I tried their almond matcha cookie and seasonal pumpkindoodle pie which were both awesome. Maybe I just came on an off day last time."
2555,"First of all, their new location is beautiful! It feels like cake wonderland. I came here as part of my birthday weekend as my best friend placed a surprise order for me! I was handed a huge bag and couldn't wait to see what was inside. Got home to a beautiful carrot cake, golden candles included. Also found a cinnamon roll and a pecan roll. I love cinnamon rolls but then pecan one was absolutely fantastic! The carrot cake was as delicious as it looked - made sure to include a cross section here for accurate description. The cake itself had the right amount of spices and was not too sweet, perfectly balancing the sweetness of the frosting. Really enjoyed this cake, can't wait to try other treats from City Cakes!"
2556,"I've heard for years how incredible City Cake cookies are and how they're some people's favorite cookie in NYC.I'm not going to try to convince Levain lovers that this is a better cookie. Everyone has difference cookie preferences. You can even like different cookies from different shops equally but for different reasons. All I can say is that I absolutely LOVE the half pound cookies here. I've tried the chocolate chip, red velvet, snickerdoodle and pink velvet. They are so indulgent, flavorful, chewy in the middle, slightly crisp on the outside. They're also super addicting, so you've been warned."
2557,"The cookies at City Cakes don't really suit my taste, but I believe that they suit many other people's. There are a lot of unique flavors, which is pretty cool. I tried the Dark Horse Double Chocolate Chip and the Pumpkindoodle Pie-filled (seasonal) cookies. I actually really enjoyed the double chocolate chip. It was quite rich and decadent. I guess the reason why I don't love these cookies is because I prefer cookies that you can finish eating one and then eat another and another. This is one big cookie."
2558,03/16 - Providing an update. Ive been back to City Cakes on several occasions in the cakes are moist. Marc (Owner) really did step up to make things right. The cakes are now better than my initial experience. I'll definitely be back to try more cakes as there are new innovative flavors to try.
2559,"The cookies are moist, huge and delicious. The service is  great (the staff is so kind) and the drinks are expertly made. The setting is like a museum, everything is so clean and pretty. The cakes are sitting in a display case and shown off really well. Everything is colorful and we honestly couldn't choose what we wanted for the longest time. Everything looked so good. We settled on the rainbow doodle and the trans pride dark horse cookie. Both were great (good the next day too, as they were so big I couldn't finish it). Worth the price for sure. They looked so good someone walking down the street asked where we'd gotten the rainbow cookie. The guy who was serving us was incredibly sweet. He completely made our experience worthy and went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied with our order."
2560,"I came to City Cakes to pick up my Yelpie's Swag Bag and my mother in law and husband came along.   We were immediately impressed and amazed by the design and layout of the store, along with the various displays and decors.We could not pass up the opportunity to buy some cakes and cookies so we purchased a few cookies and got some cake slices as well, along with coffee.The half pound cookies are amazing...I loved the snickerdoodle and ate it over a few days because it was so big.   The Vanilla Bean cake was my favorite...I loved it!   We also got coffee, which was perfect for the snowy day outside.The really fun part was seeing our cake and cookie orders coming out on the conveyor belt.   The staff working was amazing too.Can't wait to go back and get some more delicious treats!"
2561,Got a stomach ache from all the sugar from the massive pieces of cake and it was 100% worth it. I wanted cake to celebrate my birthday and went searching for cake by the slice - I got the funfetti for myself and chocolate for my partner. The vanilla bean frosting with chocolate ganache on the chocolate cake was next level. The funfetti was light and delightful (I wish it had as much frosting on the outside as the chocolate though!) and I devoured it without second thought. I ordered ahead and the pickup process went smoothly. Can't wait to come back!!
2562,"I highly recommend the Strawberry Champagne cake. It's a sugar bomb (what good cake isn't) but it's got a delicate strawberry flavor and it's simply pretty with the gold leaf accent. It's also got a good, moist, dense crumb. Their slices are GINORMOUS. Mine lasted 3 days because I ate a layer a day. So good. I missed it when it was gone. I also got the Hearty Oatmeal Raisin Half-pound cookie. With coffee it's a whole meal. Big cookies are only good if they are not over baked. These do best when reheated so the inside gets cooked just a tiny bit more without losing any moisture and becoming a brick. So definitely eat it warm! Their iced coffee is OUTSTANDING. I would come here just for the coffee, it's that good. Get the large and just wallow in it. Dammit. Now I'm jealous of the people who can just pop in for a coffee on their way to the train just feet away. That would make my whole commute. If they have indoor seating once everything gets back to normal, it would be worth the trip. In the meantime their delivery service was brisk when I was there. I can imagine the increase in small family gatherings and the need for delicious cake has gone a long way during this complete disruption in our lives. And they deliver anywhere. That's a big plus. It would be insane to have coffee delivered every day, right? Right??? Dear God don't ever make me rich. I'd blow it all so fast on coffee and cake."
2563,"Thank you Yelp NYC for highlighting this ultra modern bakery called City Cakes.  Upon entry in this new space, it immediately exudes clean.  You're greeted by a display of imaginative cake artistry, all enveloped in glass, steel and colorful aesthetics.To add to the artfulness is the magical conveyor belt, smoothly delivering your chosen desserts packaged neatly in contrasting Black and White and labeled all things City Cakes. My dessert choices were narrowed down with the help of the Friendliest City Cakes server Genesis. I decided on the decadent, not overly sweet, Killer Red Velvet 1/2lb Cookie, which once warmed beat out all my other choices.My haul also included the Chocolate Chip half pounder, a humongous slice of the Champagne Strawberry Cake, which was a bit cloyingly sweet for my taste, yet enjoyed by others. And a square of PBJ Power Bar which was satisfyingly rich and thick. The great thing about desserts, especially City Cakes gargantuan desserts, they are made to share and in turn introduces others to their establishment.  The Nutella half pounder. While viewing CC's Yelp page photos prior to my visit, this cookie enticed me, but unfortunately is no longer an available option.  I was also enticed by their pie selections and walked in hoping for a slice or two, but they won't be available for another few months. A reason to return.  If you are so inclined, City Cakes offers cake decorating classes in their well rounded facility. Opening a brand new establishment during Covid deserves your support, so pay them a visit if you can.  Thank you City Cakes for making yourselves available to distribute our Yelp Crews Yelpie Awards!"
2564,"Best Decadent Chocolate Chip Cookie Ever! The half pound cookies are so big you must share as one shares a cake (koekje). I cut the first cookie in four pieces to share, and froze the remaining cookies for the future. They come beautifully packaged with instructions on the box. We got the rich chocolate chip and the double dark horse salted chocolate chip cookies. Yummy!! City Cakes did a wonderful job of making the pick up process of the Yelp Elite Swag Bag delightful. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. The products are delicious. The shop is well designed. Each Yelpie winner received a choice of cookie, a slice of cake and beverage to go with the swag bag. We will definitely return and try some more flavors in the future! Happy Yelping!Thank you!  Dankeschön! Merci beaucoup! Grazie mille! 谢谢 ! Arigato! Muchas gracias !"
2565,"The Yelpie Awards came to NYC for the first time in 2020, and after winners were announced I learned that I was a runner-up in one of the categories. I received word from my CM that arrangements were made to pick up a goodie bag here at City Cakes; as I have never been here before, I was excited to try out a new spot *and* pick up some swag. I learned that City Cakes has been around since 2007, but has recently relocated down the block from their original location into this much larger space. Walking in, the aesthetics are ultra modern - lots of clean lines with neutral tones offset by the pops of color given off by the baked goods in the display case. They have a number of their more ornate decorations on display, and you can partially see a window that leads to the kitchen and production area. I noticed a long hall down the center of the space but I'm not sure where it leads - employee area? Sit-down space when it's safe to do so? Such a mystery.  Anyway, part of my prize was a free cake slice, cookie, and coffee beverage - but now more than ever it's important to support small businesses so I decided to pick up a few more things (also I wanted more because sweets). In total I picked up two cake slices: confetti and pineapple coconut, as well as three cookies: Reese Pieces, double chocolate, and chocolate chip. Their ricotta-Nutella scone looked intriguing so I also got that, and an iced coffee. The cookies were by far my favorite baked good of theirs - they were advertised as a half-pound each and handling them I could totally believe it. They were huge, warm, crispy on the outside and nice and gooey on the inside - a total yes. The cakes were also great - many times with such intricate flavors and designs you get style over substance, but it was good quality and very tasty. I didn't love the scone - it was too bready and dry for my taste, not really scone like; I was looking for more Nutella flavor as well. The iced coffee was solid. The staff was awesome, everyone was super nice and my order was really very quickly. Overall, I really loved my first experience at City Cakes - thank you to the staff as well as Yelp NYC for making me aware of this wonderful business. Now that I know they're here in this big beautiful space, I'll definitely be returning to explore more of their menu."
2566,"Thank you again to our CM Katey G. for your generosity in organizing such a sweet and stimulating event at City Cakes. You Rock girl!!!From doughnut baking, cookie making, cake decorating, to just about everything in between- come to City Cakes. I was already excited to pick up my Yelp goodie bag, but walking inside was sweet (pun intended) and stimulating in every way. The irresistible but subtle smell when you head inside opens up your senses. But there's no denying- for me it was the sheer pleasure of eating something fresh out of the oven and expertly made with the correct flour to butter to chocolate to moistness ratio- in just that one cookie. City has an industrialish/minimalist style- but not the type of 'industrial' that screams ceiling pipes. Style is modern with metal accents and light pouring into City's space. There's a baking school on the premises- but because of COVID, not sure when classes resume. I was greeted instantly and then the visuals in front of me, hit me. Chef Marc had an awesome attitude that matched what he's putting out. Gave me loads of information behind City Cakes' cake designer- Benny Rivera who's hailed as a leader here. Cakes are 'Latin-inspired' (as I was told) in that they're dense and not airy as Italian cakes. Not only did City Cakes offered a cookie (picked the Stuffed Pink 1/2lb Velvet Cookie), cake (chose the Amaretto-soaked cake slice and was told it'll be discontinued), and drink (water for me) on the house, but I happily trailed off with a delectable 1/2lb Chocolate Chip Cookie (wished I had another), Nutella Sconut AND a Raspberry+ Almond Scone. Chef Benny Rivera and his team are knocking out a good thing here especially with those damn 1/2lb super moist cookies. Muchisimas Gracias City Cakes for opening a new location in the new year during COVID AND seizing opportunity by the reins!"
2567,I think I ordered wrong out of desperation. So I will be going back to have the cheese corn muffin. But visually the cakes are stunning artforms. My only critique is that the counter person should listen carefully.  I ordered a bunch of items more and never had them make it onto my order so I gave up. It is louder in there or maybe it was music or perhaps he was just tired. But it was a lost opportunity.  I will return to give another straightforward cupcake and cookie a chance.
2568,"Wow! City cakes opened up their newest location this week and I had a chance to visit while picking up my Yelpie award (yay!)! I also got to choose a slice of cake, cookie and a drink. I love the feel of the place and the colorful cakes, cookies and even drinks they have to choose from. You can also have icing and sprinkles added to any cookie! They are boxed beautifully and come out to you on a cute conveyor belt. I was also really impressed by the cake creations they had on display. The cookies and cake were sweet, fresh and absolutely delicious. Open now with safety measures in place. Please support your local businesses!"
2569,"A new City Cakes location opened on 18th St between 5th & 6th Ave on Feb 1, and it's a beautiful space with lots of cookies & cakes to choose from! We ordered:1 - PINK VELVET half lb cookie stuffed & topped with sweet cream cheese frosting (note: you can top any cookie with frosting!) 2 - STRAWBERRY CHAMPAGNE with strawberry buttercream and white chocolate frosting 3 - Latte with oat milk Also check out the Alice in Wonderland creations! Covid safety measures were all in place too. Can't wait to come back and try more!"
2570,"**CITY CAKES HAS MOVED!** They're now between sixth and seventh aves; still on 15th street though. New location is incredible - it's basically Willy Wonka's chocolate factory but for cake and cookies. Orders come out on a fancy conveyer belt, and there are glass walls through which I imagine you'll eventually see cakes being made. Bio wall is very pretty, too! Most importantly, they've got a ton of new menu items (and they're continuing to roll out even more options) and a coffee bar now. Space is gorgeous and huge; a far cry from the little basement that could. Some recent offerings I've tried:Carrot cake slice - greatYogurt berry oat bar - perfectMaple apple oat bar - also perfect Raspberry almond jelly scone thing - pretty dry, needs workApple scone - also a little dry but good flavor Almond Tricolor Wonder Cake Slice - amazing, even better than the cupcakeLow-Fat Chocolate Truffle Muffin - secret hit, don't miss this!! It's like really dense and delicious chocolate cake!!Strawberry champagne cake slice - excellent Drip coffee - greatSideways sticky - amazing, I only wish it were bigger. Should have bought two. Like a Pecan sticky bunWord on the street is that they'll be adding pies soon. I also need to try the coconut lemon cake, vanilla bean confetti cake, the brownie, etc etc etc."
2571,"After entirely too many months of living here and going to many other dessert shops I finally strolled my butt over to the newly opened City Cakes Hq. The good 2 it's a mere two blocks. The bad ....it's a mere two blocks. The service was kind and attentive, the space was immaculate and the sweets were tasty. I also got a hot tea with their Chinese flower green tea as I may go back and purchased a tin but wanted to try first. To start; the sideways sinna was delicious although slightly on the small side for price compared to the side of the cookies and there price. But nonetheless I enjoyed it. But the cookies were the star for this round. I got the choco chip for the boy and the matcha for myself. Both were delicious although I think - for the first time ever -I chose a non choco chip as my favorite. The matcha was just so different and yet so dang good. I already know I'll be back in a few weeks to get a cookie stack birthday cake. Can't wait to try more of their very large selection of goodies!"
2572,"This is a brand new location, please don't merge it Yelp, but I know you probably will since it's only a block away from the tiny tiny original one.This space is MASSIVE, especially compared to the tiny underground closet that they've been somehow operating out of for 13 years or so.It's gorgeous and they have the same amazing cookies and cupcakes plus lots of new stuff, most exciting being individual slices of cake, plus scones, bars and more."
2573,"The owners have opened this new, larger location an avenue away from their former spot, and it's gorgeous and spacious and immaculate. All cookies and orders slide down a conveyer belt to you, cake-making classes will be taught in an all-glass classroom, and their whimsical custom cakes adorn the entrance. Plus, they now sell massive slices of their famous cakes! So it truly is a cookie-cake-cupcake to-go shop.My one request: please redeem all these punch cards we've collected from months of supporting you guys through the pandemic. We've got about 7 free cookies that weren't redeemed, and we'd love to collect 'em now!Congratulations on this gorgeous spot. 5 stars!!!!"
2574,"UPDATE: Went back for a second try and was pleasantly surprised! Got two cookies (cinnamon and matcha) and they were OH so good - no hard ones in sight - they were both soft, moist, and warm. Can't wait to go back and try more!Was very excited to try the cake and cookies based on all the great reviews but was disappointed by both. Had the strawberry cake - sponge was dense / stale / cardboard-y and overall waaaaay too sugary (but understand that's subjective). The cookie was again hard and stale though I liked the hits of salt. Maybe I'm too used to Levain and their soft gooey insides *shrug*. Oh well. Service was great!"
2575,"To be honest, I feel pretty comfortable saying these cookies just taste life changing. I'm so so happy I stumbled upon City Cakes! Was craving some cookies, Yelp helped  & now I'm pretty thankful for it. This place is so easy to miss, but it's still so worth it. I got the: Rich Chocolate Chip, Pink Velvet Cream Cheese Stuffed & the Red Velvet Cream Cheese Stuffed. And to be completely honest, I have 0 complaints. The cookies quite literally blew my mind. They're huge and taste legit AMAZING & are spectacular in every sense of the word. Please go to this spot, and get all the things. You will not regret it one bit!!"
2576,Great establishment!!! Wonderful atmosphere!!! The staff is friendly and professional. The cookies are a whole meal and the cakes are delicious. Can't wait to try out the holiday pies. Highly recommend it!!! ????
2577,"Stopped by this decently big pasty/cookie shop and tried a red velvet cookie. Overall, the cookie was good! I'm surprised as to how big this location is. I want to come back and try the cupcakes! Their specialty pastries look amazing."
2578,"What impresses me the most about this place is its innovative menu! The flavors of all their desserts, not just their famous cookies, all sound incredibly unique and yummy. However, while in the area, I knew I couldn't pass up the chance to try their half-pound cookies. I ended up getting their ginger spice molasses and dark horse (described as a combination of double chocolate chip, brownie, and oreo, enough said) and they were just as indulgent as they sounded with a very enjoyable chewy texture on the inside. They were so rich that the cookies ended up lasting me three days, since even a chunk satisfied my sweet tooth craving."
2579,"Caveat: this is a review based solely on customer service.  But after the amazing experience I had, you can bet I will be loading up on a bunch of goodies the second I can make my way down to City Cakes.I recently concluded a custom cake inquiry process with one of City Cakes pros (should out to Katie!).  It was more involved than I thought it would be, though that was solely because my vision exceeded my budget and Katie worked so very diligently to find a way to honor my vision while coming as close to within my budget as possible.  Through every step of our process Katie was super positive, understanding, thorough and professional.  But what really stood out to me is that there was never a pause or hesitation after I shared my concept, which included sensitive aspects of gender and queer identification.  This was a concern of mine when I did preliminary research to find a safe bakery to commission.  Based on my experience, City Cakes is showing up as an open-minded ally of a business where a person can safely have their vision fulfilled.  That, my friends, is gold.Had another option which I couldn't pass up not have come into play, it would have been a lock with CC and I'd also be speaking about those divine looking om nom noms.  But you can surely expect that update at some point in the future, as City Cakes is at the tops of my list the second I'm Chelsea-bound."
2580,"I've been here twice and I can't wait to go back! The brunch menu here has such a wide variety of options that you'll probably want to order a tons. If you're going to The Smith really hungry, you'll most likely eat your whole plate, but if you're not, the plates sizes are good for Sharing ( at least I think so).The food tastes amazing and the staff are so friendly and attentive. It does get a little loud inside depending where you sit, however I would still describe the ambience as calm (Very NY lol). You don't have to go dressed super fancy, which makes it a great last minute restaurant to dine in if you're in the area. And if you're not in the area, make some time to go because it's just that great. Did I mention their brunch is great! Lol I would so recommend The Smith. Specifically the one located closest to Lincoln Center."
2581,"I came here for brunch this past weekend with a group of friends. Very Covid friendly with outdoor dining, dividers, and heaters!Everyone also enjoyed their food. I got the avocado toast and thought it was very good. It was lemony, not spicy, and came with a basic but good side salad. The fries I shared with my friend were also really good! The coffee was good as well. Just wish the waiters were a bit more attentive they never filled our water containers until they gave us the bill."
2582,"Unenthusiastic and incomplete service accompanied by room-temperature to warm entrées made for a dissatisfying experience. (Told our waiter. Declined an entree rerun because we were starving). Two stars are for the bussing staff who were attentive and for having a zero wait time. Foretelling? So disappointing to have this experience in a city known for great eating experiences.Out of Ingredients to a signature cocktail at 10:00 pm? Sat with empty drink glasses until finally able to flag down the waiter for either a dessert order,  a drink order,  and when we gave up on the above, the check. First time ever, ever, ever leaving no tip. Here for the weekend only. Gave the two-free cocktail coupon to dining neighbors since we're leaving Sunday. Sad to have wasted an NYC dining experience here."
2583,"Lots of space and the food was good. Service was good.Noise was average. Good for big parties The bathrooms were interesting because it was one room with all unisex stalls which meant everyone washed their hands together in the sinks outside of the stalls. I've never seen that before, so it was interesting."
2584,"Classy, sophisticated, upscale environment with a menu that features healthy and non healthy comfort food. Their French toast, pancakes, and shrimp and grits are amazing. But call about brunch hours first since they don't offer it all day.I decided to take the healthy route and ordered the Little Gem Caesar with roasted salmon. It was a generous  portion, perfectly seasoned with a crispy Parmesan frico. The salmon was cooked just enough with a light pink middle. Delicious. My friend had the omelette with slow roasted tomatoes, goat cheese, soft herbs. Both dishes had quality ingredients and were flavorful. The coffee was wonderfully strong and they offered sparkling and tap water on the house. Staff was very responsive and helpful. Hosts greeted you as you walked in. During the pandemic they check your vaccine card upon entry. Also there was a plastic glass that separated each table. It felt safe. The menu looked scaled down from pre-pandemic times but the dishes were still delicious. Great place for big groups of family, friends, and coworkers."
2585,Came here for Brunch. The place was very nice. Pleasant setting. Very busy on a weekend at-least. The service was quick and food was great. Overall experience was very nice. Would definitely like to return.
2586,"We have been to this location two times. Each time we arrive, there is a long wait. The first time, we sat inside the bar as it was quicker to be seated. The second time, which was a few days ago, we were able to sit in the outdoor heated area. The service is good here and I appreciate the nice, heated outdoor space. We ordered the same thing the two times we have been here. Food is delicious here! There are other locations which we have yet to try. I ordered the benedict eggs and my husband ordered the burger. To drink, we both had their coffee which tasted fresh. I would recommend this place and would definitely visit again."
2587,"Cosy and nice atmosphere for dining. Pasta was so delicious. Even though I don't like spicy food, I really enjoyed it. Staff was very nice and helpful."
2588,A nice place for brunch and more. It could be pretty busy especially during the weekends. I would suggest to make the reservation.Foods are really nice. I never get tired of their Benedict. Mac and cheese are to die for. Thumbs up
2589,"Updated review 4 years later: The Smith is a staple in NYC. It is great for brunch, lunch or dinner. If someone is coming into town, The Smith is always the first place that comes to mind. No matter what location you go to, their quality remains. I 100% recommend their burger - it's the real deal."
2590,Highly recommend The Smith! The ambiance and food were fantastic but the service is what made it so special. We had Sam as our waiter and he was truly so delightful! The manager also came by our table to check in on us and he was equally so lovely. Can't wait to go back!
2591,"I stopped by for lunch on an Indian Summer day and ordered the Mac and Cheese. That's the only thing I ordered because I know I will feel like I ate a 5 pounder and would probably fall asleep when I get back to the office. Because they give you a huge portion. And they pile on the cheeses, some cheddar, fontina, gruyere, and top it with off reggiano they will get slightly crisp and burnt in the broiler.It does taste good but I wich it had more cheddar. I just love it when I can just stab it with a fork and get a waterfall of mac stuck cheese just oozing down back into the pie dish for my photo op and on looker just stare in amazment."
2592,"Yummy food options! Loved the oysters, house chips with blue cheese fondue, and the shrimp and grits! Easy to get a reservation and felt safe eating there!"
2593,"Disclaimer: We probably didn't have the full Smith experience as it was just an entree for each of us, no drinks. I thought the experience was just fine. The vegetarian bibimbap that I ordered was pretty bland copy of the original. I wasn't expecting an authentic experience but I think it lacked a creative spin for the price. The salads and dressings were really good though! Wished they were able to split checks, though you can scan a QR code on your check to pay online.Note, the outdoor seating is a night precarious as you/the waiters have to be aware of the busy bike lane that crosses between the sidewalk and the seating."
2594,"The first rule of the macaroni club is you don't talk about the macaroni club. If they had not already won an award, I's present them with one! But really everything I've ever had from here is great: the gnocchi, the Caesar salad, the pancakes, etc."
2595,"Order:- Braised Short Rib Cavatelli (4/5)Pros:- Good tasting food - Very large and spaced out indoor set-up and a lot of seating outdoor Cons:- Pricey - You are required to wear your mask even at the table if you are not eating and whenever the server comes by. While I understanding the reasoning, it did get tiring to constantly pull my mask up- Service is slow because they try not to come by the table too often (because of COVID)Overall: While the food was good, it was pricey and it seems like the made the menu smaller"
2596,"This is a great place for happy hour. My co-workers and I came here Friday afternoon around 3pm. Happy hour ends at 6pm. We ordered hapoy hour cocktails and beers. Our favorites were the Great Gatsby and Slushie.They have the burger & beer happy hour deal, which I ordered. I was also able to get a side with it like fries, salad, or grits. I ordered grits. It was a cheesy jalapeno kind. Delicious!My colleagues ordered the squid ink pasta, beef bolognese pasta, and steak with fries. My colleague and I split the burger and beef bolognese pasta. You would not be disappointed with their pasta. The only downfall was the butterflies and birds entering the restaurant because they have retractable doors. And they kept certain doors open which made it easier for the waiters to serve indoor dining and outdoor dining customers. However, the cigarette smell would come through depending on who passed by.We are definitely coming back and perhaps asking for a seat away from the opened doors. :)"
2597,Good spot no matter which location.  Happy hour here is worth the visit alone with good bites to accompany solid cocktails.
2598,"Worst experience ever. Our server was extremely rude. We arrived 5 min after bf ended and asked another server who walked by if they could accommodate breakfast and he was extremely nice and said let me check. Well our server comes and ask for our order. I reply with we just asked the sever who walked by if they would accommodate Breakfast, he got upset and said I already told you breakfast was over and walked away. He comes back and gives us a lecture about how if we want bf we need to come early in the morning. Then said we can do it but your food is going to be rushed and won't be that good. So i said that's fine we won't order bf and I order a grilled chicken sandwich with fries and everyone else orders. Well everyone else got their food and I'm waiting. He comes back and I let him know I'm still waiting on my food and he's like you didn't order food. I reminded him that I was the first one to place the order and he looks at me like I'm lying. I repeat my order and he leaves without saying anything. Im on vacation and really don't need the attitude from someone. Im a paying customer who wasn't asking for anything crazy."
2599,"I have been to The Smith several times. Recently, we came for dinner. We enjoyed the salmon -- well cooked and light, vegetable bibimbap -- a simple play on a cozy, Korean, classic, jalapeño grits -- creamy and delicious, blueberry pie -- delicious. Our server did not check on us and the atmosphere was chaotic. Overall, we enjoyed our experience, however, it was lacking in service and organization."
2600,"Came here for restaurant week and wasn't disappointed.  Seated right away upon arriving and the service was fantastic.  If my memory serves me correctly, I got the Lychee martini, and my date got the mojito.  Apps were the fried calamari & burratta....dinner I had the filet, and he got the NY strip...his was better for sure with the hot plate and butter sauce.  Then tiramisu and gelato for dessert. I will keep this place in mind for a future date night, very cozy and intimate."
2601,"Came for a business dinner with our board members.  The atmosphere is business appropriate and the service was great.  The seafood was great per comment from our guests.  Most of them ordered the tuna as main.  I tried the oyster Rockefeller.  They were just the right size and tasted wonderful. For main I has the 20oz ribeye.  This was the only disappointment.  I double checked with our server that it would be prepared just as well as Benjamin's.  Unfortunately, no.  I ordered it rare and the steak was medium.  It also lacks the char crust I liked at the Benjamin a few blocks down.  So they were not the same.  So while I would be back again for business dinner, I would not order the steak."
2602,"came here for their restaurant week '22 menu and made a reservation. it still took over 30 minutes to get seated while we waited at the bar. the bartender didn't take our order until after about 15 minutes of us sitting there and trying to get her attention. she was still very nice once she got our drinks, but I don't think people should be waiting so long if they made a reservation. there was a group in front of us who was seated after ~35 mins as well so we know it wasn't just a one time thing. moving onto the food- the grilled calamari tasted burnt which made it so hard to eat. I had to cut off the really burnt parts and ate more of the inside which was a disappointing way to start my meal. the lobster bisque was actually really good and my bf savored it until the last drop. the oysters were so delicious we ordered another dozen and quickly finished those too! the filet mignon was not as good as a I was hoping. I asked for medium well but it still looked pretty rare to me in some areas and the outside was pretty burnt. I couldn't really finish it even though it was such a small piece so I took it to go so I could cook it some more at home. the cream of spinach was so good, but the dish was very shallow so there wasn't much in it. my bf ordered the branzino and hers fries which he really enjoyed. although the branzino tasted a bit bland to me. the desserts (ny cheesecake and raspberry sorbet) were pretty good as well, but nothing too spectacular. glad I was able to try these during restaurant week, but I can't say I would come here again."

2604,"A truly 5 star experience and best dinner I've had in months! Came here for Valentine's Day dinner on a restaurant week promo:Appetizer:Calamari: AMAZINGGGG! Absolutely the best calamari I've had and there was so much flavor and a generous portionBurrata: so smooth and the flavor was great. The sauce paired with it was perfectEntree:Branzino: very flavorful and the fish was cooked well so that it wasn't dryFilet mignon: a nice cut but I ordered it medium well, which came a little burnt. The small potato and tomato on the plate was well seasoned and delicious as wellSides:Definitely recommend both: creamed spinach and truffle mashed potatoes. Soooo good and rich. The truffle mashed potatoes is a must!Dessert:Cheesecake: definitely not the best we've had but a nice finishing touchComplimentary coffee and tea was very nice and usually not included in other restaurant week menus! Service was perfect. A bit slow on our food since the two couples next to us sat down much later but finished about the same time as us- their food seemed to come quicker. I will need to come back and order the bone in Sirloin or NY strip. Squid ink pasta and the NY strip was very popular!! Love potion cocktail was the best of the 3 we had. Thank you for a great experience and hope to be back soon!"
2605,"Came back after a wonderful restaurant week experience. Thanks to Victor the experience was equally as good as the last time. Unfortunately we had a 7:00 pm reservation and although I asked for a back corner table, I was seated in the middle of a very very noisy restaurant. I could hear my wife so we were going to leave and Victor found us a table at the bar that was considerably quieter. We had the bone in NY strip, spinach and trufffle mashed. The food and service were outstanding, but once again thank you to VICTOR!!"
2606,"Classy, sleek atmosphere. Awesome drinks  fresh seafood  will definitely come back. Waiters are attentive. Many seafood selections on the menu."
2607,"Service was poor, food was good.They took one hour to seat us (we had a reservation) and then 30 minutes to serve us the appetizer.  We did enjoy the oyster and the tuna."
2608,"Late entry: Visited this amazing spot on 2/5/22 during restaurant week. Nothing negative to say as everything was on point. Next time I'd want to be seated outside of the ""opera room"" just so I can experience the difference. The opera room had a much quieter, sophisticated vibe. Made reservation on the same day and luckily there was availability despite being restaurant week. Everything we had was fresh and delicious! Can't wait to return and try out some oysters! Our waiter wasn't so pleasant/friendly at the beginning but warmed up towards the end. Looking forward to the next visit."
2609,"I came here last night Friday January 28th, 2022 for a belated birthday dinner. (If it's January we still celebrating) We had an 8:30pm reservation. My dinner date and I had a drink at the bar while awaiting our table. We were seated and offered delicious bread and spreads for the bread. We decided to do a bottle of Prosecco as I would have made it through a few glasses anyway so buying the bottle was better. We were informed it was restaraunt week and given two menus. After perusing both menus we opted to order from the restaurant week prix- fixe menu. For an appetizers I had the Bibb Salad which was delicious and shared some of the octopus which also delicious. I had the salmon with the truffle mash while my friend had the steak sirloin with the fingerling potatoes. We both thoroughly enjoyed our entrees 10/10. For desert we had the cheesecake and sorbet. I wasn't a huge fan of the cheesecake. The sorbet I was told was good. The restaurant is beautiful and dimly lit but overall an excellent atmosphere. The decor is def a nice steakhouse vibe. Service 10/10Food 9/10Ambience 10/10 It's street parking in the evening hours though I'm sure you can find a parking lot as well. Credit cards are accepted. I will definitely return as I had a great time, the food was exquisite and the company even better."
2610,"This place was amazing, especially with the restaurant week deal! Each course was super flavorful and filling! Didn't realize how nice of a place this is but the atmosphere is definitely a little dressier than my typical day to day wear but it wasn't a problem. I got the sirloin for my main entree and it was amazing! If you're thinking about coming here, I totally recommend it!"
2611,"Food was good but they do NOT Honor reservations. The front of the restaurant was madness packed with people waiting for a table. I arrived at 8 for my 8pm reservation and wasn't seated till 9. Others complained of the same. On open table every time frame is available! How is that possible? And I over heard them taking walk ins as well. When a guest complained, they said rebels were taking ""longer to eat, what do you want me to do about it?"". I would prefer you not over book! Nonetheless, the meal was delicious. Benjamin steak is always great. I will skip sea fire grill though."
2612,"Did some research online for seafood restaurants in NY and this one came up as a potential. It was definitely worth the visit.  We had an early dinner reservation on a Saturday and the restaurant was still packed with a healthy line of people waiting by the time we left. Service was polite and efficient. Restaurant a little dated, small dining room and older washrooms. Cocktails standard selection but properly done. We had the lump crab cake, oysters on ice, squid ink pasta and Maine lobster broiled. They really know seafood here. Lump crab cake nicely done meaty and minimal filler. Not exactly to my liking but a good representation of lump crab cake. Oysters were really fresh. Squid ink pasta was nicely done not overly salty and cooked perfectly. The lobster was perfection. They can do either steamed or broiled. Chose the broiled option and was really blown away from the cook on the lobster and the presentation. I've eaten a lot of lobster and they know how to broil it exactly. The lobster comes broiled perfectly not overly done and not under which happens at a lot of restaurants. The lobster was just right and perfect. Meat was moist and cook just to the turning point from raw and doesn't cross over to being overdone. They also present it and precut the lobster in a way that you can extract the shell like an expert. I was able to crack the huge claw and it came out intact. Scottish salmon was a nice thick cut and came out steaming hot and was also cooked perfectly to well done but not over done. As I looked around the room I was enticed by the the seafood platters and surf and turfs being served. If you love seafood and steaks this is the place for you. Overall solid old school steak and seafood restaurant dining in Manhattan NY."
2613,"We came here for my parents birthday, they were able to sit 9 people for our reservation with ease.  The staff was very accommodating and friendly.The food was delicious.  The blackened swordfish and branzino are highly recommended.  The lobster squid ink pasta was also incredible.This is my 2nd time here and would definitely come back!"
2614,"Oof where to start with my night at The Seafire Grill...I came to the restaurant on a Wednesday night (8 PM) for a talk. They seated our group inside a private room. The room was super cold - they just kept blasting the AC without a care in the world. Service itself was so slow and just terrible during the whole experience. When I first arrived there was no drinks or anything offered until at least 10 minutes later. They took our orders probably around 30 minutes after that. And we had to wait even longer till we got our food. Afterwards, each course took ages to arrive. I got there at 8 PM and didn't leave till close to 10:40 PM due to the terribly slow service. Additionally, at the end they didn't clean up our dinner dishes in one go it took multiple times and over a long time span to get them all cleaned up. They also didn't bring our desserts over until we kept nagging them to. At the end of the meal, we never even got our coffee and tea because we had to leave. The food aspect was nothing better, I got the:--LOBSTER BISQUE: My soup had been sitting out for so long that it started to develop a film on it (see picture). Additionally, the oyster crackers haphazardly thrown on the soup were stale. The flavor of the soup was nice but they were very skimpy on the amount of lobster chunks added to it. --ORGANIC SCOTTISH SALMON: The salmon was well cooked but bland. Additionally, portion control needs to be worked on because my salmon was tiny and the girl next to mines was double the size. The black rice it came with was not fully cooked either but flavor was good. However, the yogurt honey mustard sauce it came with was delicious. --TRUFFLE MASHED POTATO: Nice mashed potatoes but too heavy on the truffle oil - it was too overbearing--BRUSSELS SPROUTS: Sprouts were cooked well and the glaze and nuts it came with really complimented each other well. --MACARONS AND ASSORTMENT OF PETITE FOURS DESSERT: The dessert didn't taste too fresh and was just okAll in all, just a very disappointing and non-impressive night."
2615,"This is my go to steakhouse, as you know, there are other steakhouses in the city but as an avid seafood lover as well, this one, for me, is the best. At my most recent visit at Sea Fire Grill, the hospitality was a 10/10 as usual... but the food actually managed to be even better than I remembered. The seafood was amazingly fresh, the steaks were cooked to perfection, and the complimentary port at the end was a very nice touch. Until next time, Sea Fire Grill - I hope I don't wait another year again to drop back in!"
2616,"Was here for restaurant week and definitely wasn't a bad value for dinner. We also added some Kumamoto oysters which were okay, not my favorite types of oysters but it was either that or blue point, which was a bit disappointing. Apps: Spanish octopus and burrata Entrees: Squid ink spaghetti and sirloin steak Dessert: Cheesecake and sorbet Everything was tasty and cooked well. RW is such a hit or miss sometimes so I was pleasantly surprised. Not sure I'd come here with their normal pricing though since it's pretty expensive for the type of food you're getting, but can't go wrong with trying for RW."
2617,"Fancy restaurant- very classy interior. Definitely higher end, around $50 an entree, sides are extra. The calamari and octopus were so delicious! Cooked to perfection and flavorful. I got the swordfish dish but that was a mistake. It was dry, greasy and not very flavorful. It was a huge piece of fish but not worth $50. My friend got the lobster squid ink pasta which was much much better. It was full of flavor and had big chunks of lobster. Service was slow but it was very crowded. My water kept getting refilled so that was good. Glad I was able to experience fine dining in NYC but won't be back because there are too many other places to try!"
2618,"This is my second time visiting this establishment and both times the food and service were outstanding. Dined here for a birthday dinner in late January and we both enjoyed our time. The steak cooked to our liking, the lobster, the crab cake, the octopus, it was all delectable. Thanks to Diar and Victor for making the night fantastic."
2619,"This was my lunch before my flight (on my week1 trip to NYC for Restaurant Week) and went here without high expectation.  It was a good thing because it turned out to be one of the places I'd bring my bf and highly recommend to others.One Yelp review was right about the bread! Omg, it was buttery not too dry, easily chewed on the mouth. The dip was to die for! As one review said ""spreadable topping that tasted like the best kind of umamix mix with ricotta"". Good thing I didn't have more bread or I'd not stop eating. The calamari appetizer was filling that you could make this as your main entree. Lobster ink pasta was also aplenty that I had to take it home. And don't you ever miss the cheesecake! It was divine! Just the right amount of cheesiness, not to overbearing on the flavor. If this is typical NY cheesecake then I've been missing out! Service was great, I had to move to another table as my table outside has some water drippings from above. This place is now one of my need to go back places in NYC."
2620,"My girlfriend and I were looking for a place to go for restaurant week, and she found Sea Fire! We are both so glad we went. All of our selections (minus drinks) are from their restaurant week many, which runs $39 per person (not including drinks). Drinks:I got the gin/lavender cocktail, and she got a cucumber/vodka cocktail. Both excellent!Bread and butter:Usually I wouldn't even include this in a review but it was so good! There was this one spreadable topping included with the butter that tasted like the best kind of umami mixed with ricotta - we could not stop eating it.Appetizers:I got the burrata and thought it was very good, although I wish there was something else on the plate to compliment the flavor and texture of the cheese. But still, really delicious. My gf got the Spanish octopus, which was tender and delicious, mixed with capers and cooked peppers.Mains:I got the junior NY sirloin steak, which was delicious and cooked to perfection. Came with a very nice sauce on the side that almost tasted like a horseradish cocktail sauce that I would usually associate with shrimp, but it worked great! My gf got the squid ink pasta with maine lobster - not a ton of lobster but a very flavorful dish overall with the pasta dressed in a light clam sauce.Dessert:I got the cheesecake and she got the chocolate mousse cake. Both were delicious and very substantial! I also got a coffee, which was included in the prix fixe.Overall we left our meal very full and very satisfied. Not to mention the service was quick and friendly!  We would totally come back, and talk about an amazing restaurant week value!"
2621,"I would give this 4.5 stars. We got here around 5pm on a Saturday night before our 6pm reservation to grab a drink or two at the bar. We had the entire bar to ourselves which was nice. The cucumber nimbus was yummy and refreshing. The space is lovely, but the bathrooms feel like a school's bathroom which just felt out of place considering how nice the rest of the restaurant was. Not a problem, just odd. Our server (I wish I knew his name) was fantastic. He was funny and made great recommendations for us, paced the meal so we never felt rushed and was attentive. Onto the food . . . we started with a dozen oysters (6 east coast, 6 west coast), the oysters rockefeller, grilled calamari, and tuna tartare with caviar. The oysters and oysters rockefeller were some of the best I've ever had. The tuna tartare was also great. The grilled calamari was just fine in my opinion. For entrees, we split the alaskan king crab legs which came already split and the squid ink pasta with lobster. The server offered to have the crab legs cleaned for us but it was easy enough for us to do on our own. The crab legs and pasta were fantastic! The couple we were with ordered the strip steak and some sides (fries, brussel sprouts, and mushrooms) which they enjoyed very much. Desserts were good (chocolate molten lava cake and pecan pie), but the other food definitely stood out more. We will definitely come back again and look forward to trying some new dishes."
2622,"Just came here last week for the first time, it was easy to make a reservation even though we had 7 people. Waiters were really friendly and had knowledge for recommending great wines.We ordered Spanish Octopus for appetizer and it was a little bit salty. Steak was super tasty. Chocolate Mousse Cake was just a but too sweet. Cheesecake was okay. Overall everything was great.Would definitely come back again."
2623,I'm here for their restaurant week menu. Quiet and Elegant ambience. Fancy date worthy. Had the Spanish octopus for appetizer and steak for entree finished with chocolate mouse cake. Great service will recommend
2624,"This place was excellent for our anniversary. We had their restaurant week prefix menu. For appetizers we had Spanish octopus and burrata. Entrée it was the squid ink spaghetti and sirloin steak it's so soft and delicious,  the steak sauce omg to die for its so so good. For dessert we had the chocolate mousse and cheesecake. We bought a bottle of their Pinot Noir and we got a complimentary Moscato which was very sweet Thank you all , definitely coming back."
2625,Dined here for restaurant week with a friend and overall I'm very impressed! The octopus was so delicious and the highlight of both of our meals. For entrees I ordered the sirloin and it was cooked beautifully and the steak sauce was a great compliment to it. My friend enjoyed her pasta as well! The service was very great and we felt comfortable and welcomed as we dined here. Only reason for the star deduction was that the dessert did not reach our expectations as the chocolate mousse was way too sweet and we are avid chocolate lovers. The cappuccino we ordered also was warm when it got to the table. Overall the first two courses alone are a steal for the restaurant week price and I would stop by again.
2626,Good and fancy place but at the end they rush me out put the bill and my bf and I didn't finish our food yet so disappointed.?food was ok but not super great not worth money. Don't recommended
2627,"My boyfriend and I went to The Sea Fire Grill during restaurant week and my favorite thing about the restaurant was the ambiance. You really get the fine dining experience. I ordered the burrata as my appetizer, black ink pasta with lobster as my entree and the chocolate mousse cake for dessert. The burrata was really good, I only wished I was given bread to accompany it. Once I asked, they did bring it out. The pasta was underwhelming. I wish I would've ordered something else off the menu. The cake was very good. Definitely something to share if you're not huge on sweets. My boyfriend got octopus as his appetizer and it was AMAZING. We had finished it before I could remember to capture a picture. He wasn't very impressed by the steak (his entree) but equally enjoyed the the cake."
2628,Me and my lady stopped her randomly after leaving a meeting and we were pleasantly surprised. Great date night ambiance and the meal was good. A little on the pricier side but what do you expect from a seafood based fine dining establishment. Highly recommend the lobster bisque.
2629,"We had a great experience here. Service from the second we walked in. We were seated right away for our 7:30 reservation. Our Server Diar was very attentive to us from start to finish. We were given bread with some oil, butter and a white fish spread. It was excellent. We then started with some west coast oysters, and a tuna tartare. I had the branzino and my husband had the tuna steak. Our drinks were great too. We will definitely come back here."
2630,Terrific evening as always the specials were varied and we tasted the grilled shrimp with garlic and white wine. Excquisite.    Back again for a revival.  The experience as exquisite as always. The octopus and bisque were terrific as was the service and ambiance
2631,"Wow. Their name says it all, talk about fresh seafood at it's best. Food prepared perfectly, no complaints. Shared many apps all of which were outstanding, every plate cleared. Spanish Octopus and Crab Cake were my faves. For main I opted for the special of the night: Dover Sole(de boned table side) -- I would say it was pricey as the dish only came with the fish with no sides. Dishes seasoned well especially the Bone in Ribeye.While there were plenty of laughs and a lot of catching up, we ended the night sharing some amazing desserts: Chocolate Cake, Creme Brulee, and Key Lime Tart. Oh, did I mention free Creme Brulee with Yelp? Please do yourselves a favor to check in, well worth it.Overall, table for 5 on a Friday night, service went smoothly, the girls and I had a great time."
2632,"Went to Seafire Grill last night and it was better than ever. Food Service quality 5 star!Restaurant was full, but exercised Covid safety protocols and all diners were very comfortable.Almost like pre pandemic dining.One of the best restaurants in Manhattan and rare to be able to eat a fantastic steak dinner at a seafood and fish restaurant!"
2633,"So when price is no object, this is a pretty good place to go. We came for a quick business dinner. Service was proper and just the type of excellent service you'd want. Attentive without being nosy. Ordered a Caesar salad (so standard it's not even on menu) and it was delicious! Just rich ingredients. Who knew it could taste so good?But then we ordered the whole red snapper for two that was a special. At $140(!), it's not cheap. BUT, it comes with two sides. Oh who am I kidding, it's just a ridiculous splurge. And it was awesome. Buttery and rich and textured and cooked perfectly. With a huge piece of fish and all of it delish. And loved the shishito peppers. We were too full for desserts. But a nice place in midtown is hard to find."
2634,"Stars : 3.5Our food was great. I like the lobster ravioli. It had caviar in the sauce. Yum!  Mildly seasoned and filling portionMy couscous had too many peppers in it. It's watered the dish downWe enjoyed the atmosphere and decorThe staff was gracious and professional yet super rushed. Made us feel uncomfortable.  It's my birthday and I wanted to feel the ambiance and enjoy ppl watching. It appears they want you outta there at a fast food type of timing rate. After much pressure and not even an hour there, we left. Came, saw, done."
2635,"All of the dishes I've ordered were delicious. Their chef is not cutting corners when making the food. Steak was done just right, without too much fried or salty flavor. Atmosphere is pleasant as well."
2636,"I was excited to see that the restaurant had reopened, as it was next to the hotel I was staying in. The staff was very friendly and attentive. My waiter offered several suggestions on drinks for me and was so pleasant to speak with. My steak wasn't the best, but the lobster bisque appetizer and cheesecake dessert more than made up for it. If you're in the area you should stop in for a drink or meal if you have time. I will be back my next trip."
2637,"Had an amazing lunch the other day. I was craving raw oysters and saw this restaurant had fresh west coast oysters (my fav). I sat at the bar, the young lady who helped me was so sweet and attentive. I ordered the oysters, glass of white wine, and the crab cake. It was so good, probably some of the best crab cake I've tasted in a while. A gentleman ( I believe was the manager) came over to come to check on me as well, I appreciated that. He also pour me another glass on the house, which I really didn't expect but was super pleased. Overall it was a great experience, will return with my coworkers"
2638,"1st time eating here with some friends on restaurant week and must say, what a place!!! Awesome food, service and atmosphere.  No dissapointment at all.  Perfect fixed menu for restaurant week..."
2639,"The most disappointing restaurant experience I've had in a long time.  While they were very accommodating for our timing, the service ended there.  We sat at a high top, which was very loud from its proximity to the bar and kitchen.  Since they accommodated us for a different time before  our actual reservation, I was totally fine with this.  The service was subpar, with several mistakes being made.  The server literally said, ""I hope I can remember everything.""  We had a table of 4.  I wanted to respond with, ""I hope you can, too"" but I just smiled and hoped for the best.  They brought out the wrong salad and wrong appetizer, and then had to take our steak back to cut in the kitchen for sharing (server knew it was being shared when we were ordering).  The worst part was the $70 ribeye was undercooked.  We asked for medium rare and it came out purple and rubbery on the inside.  Since they cut it in the kitchen, they saw this themselves but chose not to be proactive about it.  I was starving and didn't feel like waiting so I just kept it.  The outside was charred and had no seasoning.  Had I ordered the $120 porterhouse I would have sent it back, gotten a salad and left.  This might be the one and only negative review I've ever written on Yelp... I was so taken aback by how bad our experience was, especially given the awesome reviews, I felt I had to share.  Maybe they were just having a off-night.. Additionally, the lobster bisque was bland.  The seafood platter, however, was really good.  Oh, I just remembered.. they checked my coat, which was nice, however, no one was there when it came time to leave.  I had to go through the costs myself to find it.  I really expected a lot more from Sea Fire.  Unfortunately, we won't be back."
2640,"The pork and chive dumplings are pretty good! The dumpling wrappers are thicker than ones that I've eaten elsewhere but it does have a nice texture/chew. Overall the pork and chive filling was good, and the dumplings are pretty big so you get a good bang for your buck. My wife and I ended up buying a bag of the frozen shrimp dumplings to-go. Also the workers are super nice here!"
2641,SO SO yum. Got the veggie wontons in chili oil and a piece of sesame bread. The wontons were AMAZING I'd eat them any time. Like really any meal any time. The bread was also delicious! Sesame is my favorite flavor ever and this was delicious. My friend got the Dan Dan noodles and said the dumplings were better but still enjoyed them.
2642,Cheap and yummyIf you are looking for something high end this is not the place but I definitely recommend
2643,My favorite place to get takeout dumplings from. You can get frozen ones but i like to order the veggie dumplings and edamame with chili oil!!!
2644,"Went to the authentic chinatown location even though it was the farthest from my apartment- probably the best decision I made and it's a little cheaper than any of the other uptown locations. Since it's still pandemic times, there is no indoor seating but there also isn't a line to get in. There is a park nearby you can go to, to sit and enjoy this delicious Chinese cuisine. I highly recommend the spicy wontons- the chili pepper oil sauce that the restaurant adds to this dish is the bomb dot com! Probably the best item in the menu if you like spicy food. Also got the chive and pork pan fried dumplings, pork fried bun and the special noodles with meat and bean sauce (dry). The pork fried bun is a little misleading- it says on the menu that it comes with three but in fact it only comes with one big bun- was not a fan. The noodles were ok as well, tasted decent with soy sauce. Will be back!"
2645,"Although I wasn't planning on coming here for lunch, I'm so glad that my change of plans led me to Vanessa's! I've been wanting to try Vanessa's for quite some time but never actually made it here until now.I stopped by on a Saturday around 2:30pm and there are a few people waiting inside and outside for their orders. I scan the QR code on my phone and place my order online.We ordered 8-piece Vegetable Boiled Dumplings (~$7), 8-piece Shrimp Boiled Dumplings (~$7), Basil Chicken Fried Dumplings - Whole Order (~$6), and Spicy Beef Dumplings (~$7). I probably waited about 20 minutes or so, which wasn't too bad considering the amount of people waiting.They are only doing to-go orders right now and although they package it well, I highly recommend eating it as soon as you get it. The dumplings are made fresh, and you can really tell! They were good quality and with the soy sauce, it was delicious *chef's kiss*. Especially on the cold day that it was.I have to say my favorites were the Basil Chicken Fried Dumplings and Spicy Beef Dumplings. Both the chicken and beef had great seasoning and were super satisfying. The Shrimp Boiled Dumplings & Vegetable Boiled Dumplings were pretty average, in my opinion. The shrimp was plentiful but there was not other flavor aside from shrimp. I think even some chives would have made a big difference.Honestly, shared between two people, the portion was solid! We actually had a bunch leftover so I think 3 people can share these 4 orders (obviously depending on your hunger level). Vanessa's is serving up some delicious dumplings! There is so much good food in the Chinatown area, and Vanessa's Dumplings is definitely on that list! I highly recommend checking them out."
2646,These are HANDS DOWN the best pan fried dumplings I have ever had. They were so crispy yet soft and highly affordable. Vanessa's needs to be one of your stops if visiting Chinatown.
2647,"My husband and I really enjoyed this place. We stayed right around the corner from it during our vacation and it didn't disappoint. Very tasty, really good flavor with the spicy sauce and garlic topping. Quick and easy!"
2648,"Really good dumplings. We had the boiled chive and pork and the fried chive and pork. The first order we made the mistake of not ordering the spicy garlic sauce. Add the spicy garlic sauce it's only $1.50 more but it makes the dish. We also tried the pork sesame sandwich and that was also pretty good. Walked an hour and half for these, it was worth it."
2649,Ordered the chicken basil and shrimp dumplings to go. The packaging was nice and it came with directions and the dumplings were affordable at around 30 dumplings for $12-14. The dumplings had a nice wrapper. The chicken basil was good until there was a tiny hard piece. The shrimp was chopped/mushy and had a fishy taste. I stopped next door and got a bag of dumplings to compare since people rave about those.
2650,"Ordered the sesame pancake with beef ($4) & some fried dumplings ($5). From what I hear they raised their prices significantly (dumplings used to be $1-2). I loved the sesame pancake. I really liked that they toasted the pancake as it gave a nice toasted sesame taste, as well as crunch. The beef was soft but a bit bland in flavor, I think adding hoisin and sriracha would complete the taste. The pickled carrots and veg were perfect, not too acidic or sweet, and rounded out the pancake perfectly. The dumplings were alright, they had a good crisp to it but the pork filling was a bit mushy & not my type of texture."
2651,"Ordered the chicken and chive dumplings, Peking duck sesame pancake and beef sesame pancake.  The pancakes flavors were very good and on point.  The chicken and basil dumplings I believe they gave us the wrong order and we received the pork and chive dumplings because it didn't taste like chicken or basil.  Price was a little bit expensive but overall wasn't overpriced since it is Manhattan I suppose.  As for if I would return I possibly would for the Peking duck pancake and perhaps to try their noodles."
2652,"I have an obsession with Vanessa's dumpling house. I come here embarrassingly often. Pre COVID they were always packed to the brim with people and it took some time to order and eat. Now they don't have any seating and lines are shorter but rest assured they are still as tasty as always! I always get the spicy wontons (pork and shrimp). It is incredibly flavorful and has a great amount of stuffing. Have a bottle of water prepared though, it is quite spicy.I also always get the sesame pancake with beef. It is full of veggies and very filling. Pro tip: it also saves well in the fridge so I sometimes buy an extra one and heat it up for lunch the next day. I've also tried their beef noodle soup and their other dumplings which are both good but not too special compared to the wontons and sesame pancakes. I dream about their wontons and pancakes all the time. Can't wait to be back!"
2653,"Ok, drove from CT to NYC. My best friend told me Venness's is open. We have purchased bulk frozen dumplings from here way before the pandemic and before they were shut down due to NYC (F) ratings. But the dumplings were delicious. 50 count for $9. Fast forward to Monday 7/2021 I drove down to New York and found out they have reopened. Without hesitation, my best friend and I got 2 Bags of cabbage & pork and 2 Bags of chives & pork. So, here is what has changed since my/ our last visit there. The frozen dumplings are 25 counts for $10. I guess this brings new meaning to less is more. The dumplings are smaller in size compared to our last visit. But, who cares...right! After all, the dumpling is delicious right? WRONG! My friend made a batch and text me stating the dough is thick and has no flavor. I said what? Yup, thick dough, and no flavor, furthermore said they were smaller as well. Fast forward to today Thur 7/2021 I decided to boil 6 dumplings. Yup, the dough was thick, not a fan of thick dough dumplings, but it's a preference. But even stranger, the dough color has changed to grayish/ purple color. Now the red flags go up. Ok, I will give it the benefit of the doubt. So, on the plate, it goes. Dressed it up with a splash of soy sauce and sprinkle of sesame seeds. Cut one in half and examined the stuffing, I guess I was looking for a purple piece of cabbage, but not one sliver of purple in the stuffing. So, now the moment of truth, the Taste,! OMG...A B S O L U T L Y SUCKED!I am truly disappointed and dissatisfied. ""F"" rating for sure. Now to find a new location to shop for the best dumpling in NYC. Let the search begin. Please feel free to share your thoughts on a dumpling house with your best-tasting dumplings remarks. Remember, I am looking for bulk frozen dumplings.Now on a positive note, the service was great. Thanks and Buen provecho"
2654,"My rating is a reflection of two of its products, the sesame pancake sandwiches and the spicy wontons. For a place called Vanessa's Dumplings, their worst product is their dumplings. They are very basic, similar to so many other dumpling houses throughout Chinatown and the Lower East Side. Many of them are stuffed with pasty ground meat with little flavor. Their Wontons however are excellent. The Wontons are topped with a load of chili and scallion and the chicken and shrimp wontons are full of chunky chopped meat and chives. The pasta shell/wrapper on the wontons are very thin and folded in a way so that they always scoop up that delicious chili oil. And don't forget their sesame pancakes. They're huge, and stuffed with slivers of fresh veggies and slabs of juicy meat."
2655,"So so so tasty.  solid staff, and they move you through quickly.  Just buy everything, including frozen dumplings to go for later!"
2656,"Fantastic, fresh dumplings at an amazing price, that's what I'm talking about! Ordered the shrimp and the cabbage/pork dumplings and both were delicious, so well seasoned. Bring cash and keep your receipt until you get the dumplings. Really glad I decided to try this place out!"
2657,"This place is amazing! We tried some of the most popular items on the m eh based off of several of hundred of reviews and we were not disappointed. The dumplings seem to all be amazing but the pork and chives was by far the best!! Excellent flavor combination. The duck pancake was also delicious and very light! The boiled wontons in the spicy sauce was my wife's favorite, as it had a nice kick to it. They have a lot of options on the menu but definitely go for the dumplings"
2658,"I was told these are the best dumplings in the city and my oh my are they good. You can also get a bag of 25 to take home with you (frozen) so you can boil/fry on your own. Awesome. Get the shrimp ones, you won't be sorry."
2659,I'm excited to say they finally have vegan meat dumplings! The beyond meat dumpling and pan fried veggie dumplings are really good! They take cash and card with a minimum of $15 (I believe). The sesame pancakes are tasty as well!
2660,"The true reason I gave Vanessa's 5 stars is not just because of its notoriety in the city but more for its wonderfully simple yet savory Sesame Pancake Sandwiches. What a fantastic (and filling!) meal, perfect for a weekday lunch!Ordered the dumplings as well, which are done really well. Flavors are perfect and you really couldn't ask for more when dipped in the sauce they provide. The steamed pork bun (bola bola siopao as we'd call it back home) was superb and took me back to my childhood breakfast of choice. No outdoor dining. I wish they had an upper Manhattan location but since they don't I have to pick it up in Chinatown and bring it uptown to eat. Worth the trip and the wait though!"
2661,"This place is so overrated. I don't know how the white hipsters decided this was the dumpling joint when literally 2 stores down there is Fu Zhou Cuisine, which has amazing dumplings that are also cheap and fast.For those who don't know, your dumplings should not be falling apart when you dip them in sauce. Also, raw chili oil, soy sauce, and vinegar as a dipping base at the table are so much better than Sriracha. I really encourage everyone who thinks this is a good dumpling spot to try another nearby. I guarantee it will be like night & day for you and your eyes will finally open to the true tastiness dumplings have to offer."
2662,"It took more than 20 minutes to get a single order of dumplings when it wasn't even busy.  They're not hand-folding them or anything, so this is completely unacceptable for how much they now cost.  The taste isn't bad, and the toppings are nice, but it's not worth the cost and wait.  Especially not with five people behind the counter giving pretty poor service."
2663,"The pork cabbage boiled dumplings were delicious, especially with the chili cilantro sauce."
2664,"6.8/10fried dumplings: quality not consistent, one batch had a nice sear and the other had non sear at all (refer to picture); decent crisp (on the one with sear), but could certainly be better; the filling was too heavy on chives, very little pork; relatively heavy on oil as well, had to dump oil before taking second bite of every dumpling; above average dough; overall, not a terrible dumpling, decent flavor, but can certainly use some quality control and be more generous with the pork (although understandable due to times we're living in)"
2665,"Ooooo....We Love their wontons with hot oil.  The noodles w/ spicy beef is very good too.  We also get vegetable sandwich and I save it for breakfast.I love it that I can buy iced-coffee, iced lemon tea, taro teas, etc.Sometimes, there's a long line and sometimes it is not. Either way, Vanessa's Dumpling House is DELICIOUS. We also get side order of steamed bok choy along with the dumplings. My friend drives from Westchester County to buy food from this place with me!   Not a joke."
2666,"I recently have been into dumplings and so was really excited to see what Vanessa's Dumpling was all about! It's a small restaurant and it was very crowded when we went. The food smelt soo good I was super excited to taste it. The home-made dumplings are SO GOOD!Fried Dumplings Cabbage and Pork: These dumplings were filled with a good amount of meat. The dough was crispy, but also a little thicker than the ones I had before. With a little soy sauce and sriracha, the dumpling was perfect!Boiled Dumplings Cabbage and Pork: When i first saw the dumplings, it looked really soft and tasteless so I was not sure if we should have ordered the boiled dumplings. Then on the first bite into the dumplings it was SO JUICY inside!! It was not doughy like I thought. In fact, it was pretty thin layer of dough around the meat. Sesame Pancake with Roasted Beef: The sesame pancake was so fresh and crispy! It was a very neat way of a sandwich. If you love sesame and crispy sandwiches you will not be disappointed with this!Would definitely recommend!"
2667,"I got fried chicken & basil dumplings, as well as the coconut milk tea, and i can honestly say these did not disappoint. the dumplings were rich in flavor and the bubble tea was delicious. i definitely need to come back here to get them again. 10/10 for both items."
2668,"I used to get Vanessa's often from the Williamsburg location and wanted to fulfill my cravings because I've never been to the Chinatown spot, assuming it would be better (it's the original location).  I ended up waiting 35 min for my order outside and also they increased prices (I understand because of hard times); they should have updated their menus with the new prices because a meal that should have costed $23 from their old menu was $35 (before tip..with tip was $41).  Pork and Chives Dumplings that were $2 are now $5 for example.  There were about 4 people in the kitchen and when I peeked in after 15 min they were just standing around not cooking anything.  The food was not as good as I remembered (from the Williamsburg spot) and we both had stomach aches after.  Won't be coming back to this location :/"
2669,"Craving for dumplings yesterday, so we stopped by lower east side for some old good dumplings. I can say, I've had better, but for the price? This place is good enough. It was ready, waiting for us when we picked up and still hot enough. The pork and chive dumplings were the tastiest; the chicken and basil were hardly discernible, meaning I couldn't tell if there were basil in it and I love the taste of basil. We got fried wonton with spicy sauce. Again, the only thing I tasted was the spicy chili which asked for taro bubble tea and Gong Cha was nearby. Anyhoo, I might still go back for the pork and chives."
2670,"This was one of my bookmarks to try for the longest time. Every time I tried to get a table, or make a reservation, they were booked. So tonight, my friend and I decided to stop by to see if we might be able to get a table. They seated us right away. Ambiance: Lively/ crowded Food: bon chon consisted of dried pollack, kim chi, crab salad and potato salad.Small plates: grilled eggplant with ricotta tofu- 4 stars - It was so delicious! Fried chicken - 4 stars - Tender thigh meat with good flavorLarge plate: Grilled Beef - 5 stars - the beef was tender and the dressing on the side salad was really good.Drinks- 5 stars - Mint Garden and I'm Pine were really delicious! I'd definitely go back with more friends and hopefully we'll have luck to get a table right away again!"
2671,"So freaking good. I would definitely recommend coming here. If you know you want to come, I would suggest making a reservation. I didn't make a reservation and had to wait ~50 minutes. My friend and I ordered the kimchi pancake and it was amazing, so perfectly crisp and different from what I expected. We also shared one of the spicy seafood pots. I was nervous it'd be too spicy but it was actually more sweet. We were stuffed and had some leftover for both of us. Price isn't too unreasonable and I felt like the service was wonderful. Will definitely come back :)"
2672,"GET THE BOSSAM!Loved this place so much for brunch that I came back for dinner and it was v tasty. We came at 5:15 and a line was already starting to form and it got filled up within minutes of us being seated when they opened for dinner at 5:30. Definitely recommend making a reservation or coming early. Kimchi pancake: 3/5, liked the crispiness but was a little too bland for my tasteBossam: 6/5, show stopping, divine empress of the whole menu. It was so good and I would absolutely get it again.Budae Jjigae: 5/5, you can't really mess this up. It wasn't anything incredibly special but it was perfect for a cold rainy day.Dessert:Black sesame ice cream: 4/5, really liked the green tea biscuits as they paired really well with the i cream. I was not a fan of the strawberries paired with it though. Big portion.Tiramisu: 5/5. Definitely recommend over the ice cream!"
2673,"I came here for lunch with my best friend while we were visiting the city and BOY WAS IT PACKED. Definitely MAKE A RES if you are planning to dine here. They have a set menu for their lunch so looking at the menu before was a bit misleading, but the food was nevertheless good. We both got the chicken kalguksu- so heartwarming on the cold day we went. The dumplings we got as an app were good but nothing extraordinary. Such a cute small restaurant with a great homey ambiance. Definitely recommend!"
2674,"Made a reservation for the Spot on a random Tuesday for a catch-up dinner with my friend. Little did I know that it was actually the restaurants birthday! Service was so hospitable as a line of people bowed to greet you into the restaurant. They also gave every person a little gift box with a small jar with a sugar, ginger, lemon solution. For our meal my friend and I ordered the following:0) Peach Blossom + Jeju Island: Both these drinks were GORGEOUS. Like wow. And my drink (the peach blossom was delicious too. A bit floral and almost juicy tasting but not too sweet. (4.5/5)1) Boneless KFC w/ Sweet and Sour Sauce: Instead of tossing the KFC in sauce, this place just serves it on the side. This means the sauce doesn't cling onto the breading as much to create that unique texture. Dipping it works fine and the chicken is moist and crunchy so it's still delicious. It just lacks that sticky goodness of traditional KFC (4/5)2) Corn and Cheese Croquettes: Just the perfect amount of well seasoned potato and a crispy crunch. The corn and cheese filling work very well too. Just a solid croquette all around (4.25/5)3) Raw Calamari w/ Perilla Leaf Pesto Muchim and Pickled White Wood Ear: I can't quite explain why I wasn't a fan of this item. I enjoy all the parts individually but there was just this strange sweetness and floral flavor. I didn't hate it but I found that I couldn't eat more than a couple small bites of this at a time and the portion is sizeable. I did like the lightly pickled white wood ear on top though. (3/5)4) Bulgogi: I've never had a bulgogi quite with this texture. It's almost like it was roughly mashed then regrilled for extra crispy caramellization along all the extra surface area. It's also fall apart tender. (4.5/5)Overall my visit here was very enjoyable. The kind service, good food, and nice atmosphere just make for an all around pleasant experience."
2675,"This place is eye-popping good. One of those places I marked as a 5-star in a heartbeat. It was a cold winter night and the waiting list was long. You can leave your number and walk around but be sure to reply and be there promptly. Our mistake was we didn't reply because we're already heading there and they sort of crossed us out. Thankfully the host was accommodating enough to put us back and give us the next ready table.Anyhow they serve Korean food but I would say it's more modern. We ordered gejang (spicy marinated raw crab), black sesame tofu, and Galbi Hot Pot. All of the food were amazing and delicious! The presentation was really pretty too! I can't even pick a favorite because everything was so good. It's a little bit pricey but definitely still within expected range for the quality and the service. Superb!"
2676,"Great spot for lunch if you're in the Ktown area! I usually don't make reservations, they always seem to have seating. Their lunch options are pretty good and service is always quick and friendly. Prices and portions are very reasonable and taste isn't bad either. Def worth trying for a quick lunch!"
2677,"This review is definitely overdue and we came in late September. I had forgotten to publish this review and noticed that they are closed until the end of the month. This was one of our first dinners in NY and we absolutely loved trying all their different items and drinks.For their drinks, we got the yuzu beer, jeju island, pomegranate sangria, lychee cocktail, peach blossom, and one more. These were great and we enjoyed all of our drinks. They were presented well.As for the food, we ordered their seafood pancake, pork belly, japchae, black sesame tofu, veggie bibimbap and dumplings. There was nothing too unique with any of the dishes besides the black sesame tofu. We really enjoyed this dish and thought it was unique, this is definitely a must try.The total came out to be $195 with 20% gratuity which was reasonable for the drinks we ordered. Nothing was too filling but we had a good time in our own booth outside."
2678,"This review is a little overdue. I came with my parents as an early little Christmas family dinner. We made reservations online and were seated right away. I would recommend making reservations as there were a few parties waiting outside and by the time we left, there was an even larger crowd. The inside was pleasant and bigger than expected. I will admit that it was pretty decently filled but we were in the back next to a wall so there were not people on all sides of us. Let me just give a shout out to the service here because they were incredibly efficient and observant. Of course, they were also polite. They had our orders out so quickly, were on top of removing plates and such when we finished, and got the check to us quickly. Really, they had it all running so smoothly!Now on to the food of course. We got the black sesame tofu, pork belly (large), fried chicken (small), kimchi pancake, grilled bulgogi, and to finish it all up, the spring garden. I mean the hundreds of other reviews kind of show that the food, to no surprise, was good. I particularly liked the bulgogi, so tender and the marinade was not too sweet. Also, aside from the bulgogi, the spring garden dessert was right up my alley! As I grow older, my ability to handle and enjoy the sweets I did as a kid has diminished. Of course, I still enjoy my desserts, but I can't take loads of sugar in them anymore. I liked how this was not overwhelmingly sweet or incredibly rich. Would definitely be interested in checking out some of the other dishes. While I enjoyed the meal and could see myself coming back, I do admit, this place is a bit more on the pricey side...at least for me. It is not like dinner will break the bank or anything but, could you get these same or at least similar dishes (albeit maybe not as nicely plated and all together) of similar quality at a cheaper place? Probably."
2679,"NOTE **They are closing for a month starting in January 2022 for renovations**Her Name Is Han is a hidden gem near Koreatown, offering key Korean staples in a modernized, upscale environment.  I came here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by how delicious everything was.RESERVATIONSWe didn't have reservations and it was pretty packed for a weekday.  The wait was about 30 minutes for a table.FOODAs for food, they offer lunch sets which I highly recommend trying.  It comes with soup, green & potato salad and a variety of small side dishes (tofu, kimchi, etc.) which were all incredibly tasty. We opted for the:* Han Dumpling ($8)* Slow Cooked Pork Belly ($14)* Garlic Chicken BBQ Lunch Set ($17)* Bibimbap w/ Beef Lunch Set ($18)I would personally reorder everything other than the dumpling.  While the dumpling was tasty, I didn't think there was anything special about it, especially at its price point.  All the meats we tried were tender and aromatic.  The soup in the lunch set was also a favorite and I enjoyed the broth very much.SERVICEDishes came out in a reasonable manner but I wouldn't say that the service was outstanding.  The restaurant was very busy so it's understandable.Overall, I highly recommend giving this place a try and would come back to give their dinner menu a shot!"
2680,"FYI - CASH ONLY!!Shu Jiao is probably one of the best restaurants I've been to in NYC. With so many food options in the area that's constantly tugging at your attention so you can check-off your never ending bucket list, I find that Shu Jiao is the one that's worth going to more than once. The first time I came here summer of 2019, I was blown away by how cheap the dumplings were here. Almost three years later, the prices have barely gone up. You can get 10 super juicy, flavorful, and PHAT boiled dumplings for $4.Let me emphasize, they're really BIG dumplings. The ""Pork and Cabbage"" dumplings are my favorite (with a slightly sweet flavor from the napa and other seasonings) but you can't go wrong with ""Pork and Chive"". The dumplings come out extremely quickly and they are hot and fresh - dumplings don't taste like they've been previously frozen.If only I lived in NYC, I would for sure buy a bag of 50 frozen dumplings to go so I can eat them during lazy days when I don't want to cook. I really can't emphasize how tasty these dumplings are."
2681,"Yum. Affordable and delicious.The Sesame Noodles are amazing, their dumplings are pretty good and you just can't go wrong with the soup noodles.I ordered 50 frozen dumplings to go for only $12!"
2682,"If you're looking for an inexpensive (cash only), quick and delicious meal - this is the place to go! I've been here many times over the years, and have tried mostly everything on the menu. Strongly recommend the following items:1) Item 4: Dumplings, especially pork and chives2) Item 5: Wheat noodle with peanut butter sauce3) Item 8: Beef tripe soup4) Item 12: Pork ball soupI usually order a large order of dumplings or noodles, along with a small soup. I didn't especially enjoy the noodle soup dishes, but rather order the soup separately.Also they sell frozen dumplings and fish / pork balls - the prices are more reasonable than ones that can be purchased from Flushing."
2683,The #5 (wheat noodles with peanut butter sauce) is amazing. The peanut butter flavor is just subtle enough. Service is quick. I can't wait to go back to try the dumplings.
2684,"Ordered the large chicken and chive and pork and chive dumplings with the beef tripe thin noodle soup. Only $13! It was a really warm meal for the cold NY days. Literally melted my whole body. They're not the most flavorful dishes, but there's plenty of sauces at the tables so you can fix them up yourself. It was hard to tell whether I waited for my meal at the counter or just sat and waited to see if the cashier guy would make eye contact with me because I didn't have a number to be called or a name so that was confusing as a tourist. But I just waited in both areas for some time and my food was ready in minutes so not a bad experience. Just a bit confusing!"
2685,"For the price it's definitely 5 star. We ordered chicken and chives dumplings and pork and chive dumplings and beef noodle soup with 2 diet cokes for $15. That's amazing.The dumplings were a good size for 40 cents each, it comes in 10 for $4.  This is definitely a hole in the wall, but worth it. It is cash only.  If you want to buy frozen dumplings, you can - 50 for $12.99.  This is one of my regret, we bought 4 orders of cooked dumplings on our flight back to San Francisco, when we were waiting for our order, that's when I discovered the frozen dumplings and my husband was worried about the already ordered dumplings. But since we had a long wait in the airport, we were able to eat the 3 orders and consciously saved the 4th for our daughter back home. Even at the airport we were regretting not getting the frozen ones."
2686,"Shu Jiao Fu Zhou is very much a hole-in-the-wall eatery, located in the Lower East Side. the interior is messy and gritty, especially during busy hours. it is very divey and actual. there are some tables if you want to dine-in. order at the counter, tell them whether it's takeout or dine-in,  and wait for your food number to be called. it's CASH ONLY. was here recently and order takeout: fish ball soup (small) as well as the wheat noodles in peanut sauce. both hit the spot on a cold winter evening when i got home. a light dinner that was satisfying. the fish balls came in a clear flavorful broth with 6 fish balls. the fish balls were tender, carb-y, had the fish umami, and were filled with a little pork. the wheat noodles in a light peanut sauce were really good--they had those carb-y fatty calories that your winter hunger wants. if you come here, order the steamed pork-chive dumplings as they don't miss. the fish ball soup (small) and the wheat noodles in peanut sauce are $2.75 each. staff are quick and my food was packaged and bagged neatly. drops mic cuz noodz are life i outzzz"
2687,"Just saw this place on instagram from a foodie blogger and it happens to be 5 mins from my hair salon where I had an appointment today (1.30). Decided to stop by for lunch prior to my appointment. 1. This place is cash only2. There are only a few tables, but I asked some guys if I could sit with them,  the table was big enough that it wasn't awkward. 3. Everything is so cheap! I got the large size pork & chive dumplings for $4, and wheat noodles with peanut butter sauce for $2.75. I only ate half of everything before I had to leave for my appointment but was craving it the whole time. Mid way through my appointment I shoveled the now room temp noodles in my mouth,  and I think they might have even tasted better this way! 4. I did notice prices were a little higher if ordering takeout/delivery.  Definitely recommend for fast cheap eats in Chinatown. Support your local Asian restaurants!"
2688,"Good food at cheap prices (albeit is cash only)!!! The place has a decent amount of seating, and you don't have to wait too long for your food. Also a bonus, their bathroom is much larger than the average NYC bathroom! Pork and chive dumpling - got the large size, 10 for $4. Had a great flavor, and was slightly sweet. Definitely recommend. Wheat noodle with peanut sauce, $2.75. Also good. We had to mix it a little bit cause the top was a little under flavored. My husband liked this more than the dumplings, but I liked the dumplings more."
2689,"Ordered: Large Pork & Chive Dumplings (10 pcs) ($4), Large Pork & Cabbage Dumplings (10 pcs) ($4), Large Pork Ball Soup ($4.50), Large Fish Ball Soup ($4.50)They recently moved to a new location and it's a well-deserved upgrade! There's plenty of seating at the new location, so you can enjoy your food inside the restaurant. The staff was friendly and the service was quick!  Dumplings - Huge fan of the dumplings here! They were reminiscent of my grandma's dumplings I ate growing up. The skins were pretty thin and the dumplings were stuffed full. Each bite was bursting with flavor! They're more well known for their Pork & Chive Dumplings, but I enjoyed both! They also sell bags of frozen dumplings for $12, which are an even better bang for your buck!  Pork Ball Soup - Although their most popular items are the dumplings and peanut butter noodles, don't sleep on their Pork Ball Soup. It's my favorite dish and I get it every time I stop by. The pork balls were so good and reminded me of when I had this dish when I visited Fuzhou. The soup had a subtle vinegar flavor, which I loved.   Fish Ball Soup - The only item I wasn't really a fan. The soup was bland and the fish balls had minimal filling.  Overall, highly recommend checking this place out some authentic and delicious Fuzhou cuisine!"
2690,"Shu Jiao Fu Zhou Cuisine Ratings: 4.7/5Food: 5/5 - Heard this place has the best pork & chive dumplings in the entire NYC, and hands down we totally agree with this statement. This place has become our favorite place now in Chinatown for some FJ dumplings or peanut butter noodles. - Pork & Chive Dumplings [GET]: Blew my mind away, and probably the juiciest dumplings I have ever had in my life. The dumpling skin is thin and chewy with an amazing texture, super al dente. The filling-to-wrapper ratio was also on point. The pork filings tasted heavenly, literally so tasty that we had to order a second round. My sister and I can easily eat 6, nothing like what we had before. This was perfection, and you will need to try it yourselves. - Chicken & Mushroom Dumplings [GET]: Not my favorite thing of the day, but it's definitely something new. I really like the chicken and mushroom fillings, thought they were a good pair and compliments each other. Flavor was good, well-seasoned, and chicken was tender. The only downside was the dumpling skin was not as chewy as the pork & chive dumplings for some reason. - Fish Ball Soup [GET]: Great quality fish balls with a good bouncy texture. The dough was packed with fish flavors, fresh, and the pork fillings are delicious and flavorful. Pro tip is to add vinegar to the soup, definitely a game changer. This dish pairs well with the whole wheat noodles with peanut butter sauce. - Wonton Soup [GET]: Classic wonton soup at all FJ restaurants. Wontons are cooked well. Wonton skin was thin and delightful. The fillings are great and the size is just right, perfect snack on a cold day in NYC. Also, the same pro tip as the fish ball soup, which is to add vinegar to the soup, because it elevates the flavor profile of the soup. - Whole Wheat Noodles with Peanut Butter Sauce [GET]: Noodles are well-cooked and not soggy. I like the sauce. Definitely taste the peanut butter, soy sauce, cooking wine, sesame oil, which is fabulous. This is probably the better whole wheat noodles with peanut butter sauce in Chinatown.Ambiance: 4.5/5 - They recently moved to a new location on Grand Street, so the interior is a lot more spacious and cleaner. There are plenty of seats, so you can enjoy the meal in peace and not feel squished. There's a big menu displayed on the wall right next to the register, and it is simple and a small menu. This place can get crowded, loud, and with people walking in and out of the restaurant. This place be bussing most of the time, because the food is just that good and cheap. Price: 5/5 - This place is insanely cheap and amazing VALUE for fresh food. My sister and I ordered 6 items total, an each items are $2.75. The total came up to be around $16.50 with tax already included. They only accepts CASH.Service: 4.25/5 - Do not come here to expect good service, but do expect efficient and prompt service and friendly staffs. There aren't much interactions, it's because they are busy. However, the ordering process was easy. You basically tell the cashier what you want by telling them the corresponding numbers listed on the menu, and they will call your order number once the food is ready for you to pick it up. BLUF: The best pork and chive dumplings in NYC. The most SOUL satisfying meal you will ever have in Chinatown, NYC. A must try spot, and as a FJ, I approve of this place. Say no more, and just go try it out yourself."
2691,"Ah - I finally got to come back here after things recovered a bit from covid. I'm so glad to see they are not only back but also they are renovated and thriving! I was so sad when they closed during the pandemic and hoped they would survive through it.I always always get the peanut noodles and dumplings. They are SO SO SO FREAKING DELICIOUS. The noodles are savory and full of umami... the dumplings are perfection - the skin which is not too thick or too thin, chewy, and fragrant pork + chive filling... my mouth is watering as I type. You just have to go try. And you honestly can't beat the price. I love Chinatown. I hope these establishments thrive and stay forever."
2692,"Such a cheap spot for some tasty noodles and dumplings! The portions of the noodles are so big and makes for a nice pair with the dumplings. The peanut sauce gives it a savory taste. I really enjoyed the pork and chive dumplings, they were excellent quality and each bite was delish.This spot is cash only, so make sure to bring some bills! At such a cheap price point, you are sure to get your moneys worth.The order:-Wheat Noodles with Peanut Butter Sauce ($2.75)-Pork and Chive Dumplings 6 pcs ($2.75)"
2693,"My favorite were definitely the dumplings here. The pork and chive dumplings are such a good deal and they're so good. The outside is thin and soft but not too soft to the point of falling apart. The meat on the inside has good flavor from the chives and they come with a good amount of meat. The tables have vinegar, sugar, and hot chili oil. I wanted to try the fish ball soup since fu zhou is a city in China that is known for fish balls. I liked how they had an inside meat filling, and the fish balls were soft and flavorful. I ordered the large portion of the soup, but I was expecting/hoping there'd also be noodles to go along with it. I've seen other photos with fish balls and noodles so maybe you can request that? The fish balls were decent, but I wish the soup base had more flavor to it.My friends tried the peanut noodles and loved them so I'll try these next time I'm here!"
2694,"We went to Shu Jiao Fuzhou to get some yummy dumplings. They're known for very cheap yet good dumplings.We got Pork and chive dumplings (10) for only $4!!! That is insanely cheap!!! It was good too! They provided soy sauce, vinegar and chili oil to dip with. Service came out fast too!Wonton soup and Beef tripe soup were only $2.75 each!!! Our breakfast from here alone was just less than $10 between the two of us. Soooo cheap! The broth was good too! Wontons we're teeny, tiny. I can barely get a taste of the meat before it was all gone in my mouth. The tripe was plentiful and good.Pros:-very cheap yet good food-has indoor seating-provides plastic utensils, napkins, condiments like soy sauce, vinegar and chili oil-provides takeout containers-checks vaccination cardCons:-no restroom -slightly dirty and old but who cares! Typical Chinese restaurant that services good and cheap food.. that's all that matters!"
2695,"In todays economy, I'm happy this Chinatown staple- closer to Little Italy, is still open.I got a soup, noodles and wontons for under $9. The food was fast, flavorful and the place was packed as usual. I was happy to find a vacant table (although they do open cafeteria style- so be ready to share tables if your in smaller parties). Everyone is friendly and seem to be concerned with their meals- as told by delightful eating dances and 'mhmmm' sounds that fill the somewhat chilly restaurant. Make sure to add the chili oil or sriracha provided at the table to spice your life up. Glad there's a clean bathroom you can use too- especially helpful in the area- when looking for a good bite to eat and exploring the area."
2696,"Not sure why I rated it a 4/5 the last time I was here some years ago... especially since I've always raves about this place to other people.Welp, I came back and it seems like the place had a renovation as there's much more space and it's much cleaner haha! There's no longer any bar seating by the window, but definitely way more tables available. The turnover rate is quite fast so while it may look very full inside, you shouldn't need to wait too long for a table to be available.Seems like their menu became a bit smaller compared to years ago. My go-to orders still taste just as delicious as I remembered -- peanut butter noodles and their pork chive dumplings. *drool*They sell frozen dumplings of I think it was 50-100 count and it is SO WORTH IT!!!!!!"
2697,"There's a reason why this spot is so popular with the locals. It's a no-frills, hole-in-the-wall spot with unbeatable prices and all the staples. The food is ready in seconds! The fish ball soup is less than $3, and you can get a large plate of 10 fresh dumplings with perfectly thin skin for just a few bucks more. There are also several noodle options."
2698,"First off I love how early they are open (8:30am) and that their menu are reasonable and their food is absolutely comforting and delicious! Usually I like to come here before work so I can pick up my meal for the day. It's so close to the M15 bus on Allen Street so that just makes it so much more easy for me to visit this place. Inside is spacious. They do offer plenty of seating so you can comfortably sit in for a quick meal and leave especially when it's super cold outside. This place is perfect.  As for their menu, it's easy to choose from. They have it posted outside and inside in big bolded letters so you can easily read and it's listed by numbers so you can just tell the guy which number you want. I highly recommend their #4, dumplings and chives and their wheat noodle with peanut butter sauce. It's an absolutely perfect combo and will definitely hit the spot. Monetarily they are very affordable and it won't break the bank. If you're ever thinking of doing a dumpling crawl with a group this place is also one that I would definitely recommend.  The only thing that I would they would offer is more different choices with dipping sauce. That would totally take their dumplings to a whole new level and it would be a game changer in my book."
2699,"One of my new favorites in NYC! This place is the epitome of cheap eats x comfort food. Each item is like $2-3 so you can have a full meal for $5. I tried the wheat noodles with peanut sauce and the beef tripe soup - noodles look really simple but it is so flavor packed and delicious, SO worth the $2.50. Beef tripe soup is great too especially on a cold day! I also bought the frozen dumplings (pork/cabbage) which are priced similarly to other stores I've tried in Chinatown, and it was by far the best one I've had bc it's so juicy and savory. The store has a decent amount of tables inside. You order at the counter and they call your receipt number out when it's ready, and then you take your tray to any table. Service is pretty quick, I think I waited only 5 minutes. Would highly recommend this place and can't wait to come back!"
2700,"Absolutely amazing lunch spot on cold days. Loved the food, cheap prices, quick service. We got 2 dishes: 1. Whole wheat noodles peanut butter sauce:Amazing noodles for people who like peanut butter. It was a delight on a cold day. $2.75!!2. Chicken and Chive dumplings:Must try with their chilli oil. Best we've had in weeks! $4!!Cheapest and the most soul satisfying lunch in Chinatown. A must try spot."
2701,"A nice, cheap eats place in Chinatown. Got all 5 plates below for $13.75 total ($2.75 per plate)!  - Pork & Chive dumplings (small = 6 pieces)- Chicken & Chive dumplings (small = 6 pieces)- Wonton soup- Wheat noodle with peanut butter sauce- Fish ball soup (small)I recommend trying the pork & chive dumplings. Surprisingly tasty and juicy. The chicken & chive dumplings were not memorable so... shrugs* Everything else tasted pleasantly simple, if that makes sense. - Quick service (waited 5 minutes) - Cash only- Must show vaccination card for dine-in.- Restrooms to the far left of the counter. - Dirty indoor dine-in area but there are plenty of tables with disposable utensils"
2702,"Sunday evening, came by here after a couple failed attempts at dinner spots in the area. At first had gone to the original location, which was obviously closed, and ended up finding their new location one block down.Despite it being dinner-time, the line wasn't too bad here and still available spots to sit and eat. Ordered the Pork & Chive Dumplings ($4), Pork Ball Soup ($2.75), and Wheat Noodle w/peanut sauce ($2.75). Tremendous value overall with all the items coming out fresh in only a few minutes. Dumplings are twelve to an order - thin casing stuffed with pork and chive balls. Simple and easy to eat, especially with the sauces provided at each table. Pork ball soup is similar, as there are about twelve balls with even thinner casing swimming in a light meat broth. Warming and perfect for a cold day. Only drawback were the wheat noodles which were basic and chewy (also the only only vegetarian option on the menu).Abrupt no-nonsense service and cash only. Bang for the buck, easily a top choice."
2703,I understood there is a lot of hype for this place due to PRICES but what I didn't realize this plate of noods and dumplings would instead be a bomb of flavortown on top of ridiculously cheap fare for my wallet. Came in the middle of October when sweater weather was starting to hit the streets. Dumplings and noodles sounded like a good snack and were nearby. We opted to eat inside since it was warm but I will say inside is very bare and typical of your mom and pop establishments. They were busy and food came out not the quickest but not too long either. My favorite bit was def the noodles - it was so soft without being soggy. The sauce had hints of peanut without being overpowering. Sizers were perfect. Loved the dumplings as well with the sauces. Probably one of the better places I had.
2704,Tried thin wontons & round wontons. Loved the former one. Inexpensive but hard to find tables. Cash only.
2705,"This is the type of you place you visit once a week for the rest of your life. It's a small menu but what they do offer is outstanding. The pork and chive dumplings are fresh, made in house and absolutely stuffed. I think their peanut noodles pairs well with the dumplings. Just add some of their outstanding hot chili oil !"
2706,"Not the best place to sit down at, but the food was so cheap. The noodles in peanut butter were pretty good and covered almost the whole plate. My favorite was the pork and chive dumplings which were only $4 for 10, boiled instead of fried. The beef tripe with rice noodles were okay. The soup was fairly bland, so you will need sauces. I would get take out next time instead of sitting at their tables."
2707,"I loooved the Pork and Chive Dumplings! I would come back and buy a whole bag of them frozen in a heartbeat. The Wheat Noodle with Peanut Butter Sauce was good too, but not sure if I'd order it again. The peanut butter and oil were really fragrant, but I felt the overall noodles were still lacking salt/flavor/spices. For a total of $5.50 for both orders, this is probably hands down the cheapest place I've gotten a satisfactory-sized meal (aka enough food to even be considered a meal) in Manhattan. There is a good amount of seating indoors, but it does get busy so you may have to wait a bit for a table to clear up!"
2708,"Great value. Best boiled dumplings I've had in the US, which says a lot considering that I live in the San Gabriel Valley. Thin skins, great filling-to-wrapper ratio. They pack the dumplings filling as much as I do when I make it homemade. You really can't beat the price and value. Couple of tips:- Cash only.- Limited inside seating. - Don't come here if you're looking for 5-star service, come here only if you want 5-star food.If I lived in NYC, I would frequent here often and also have a pack of their frozen dumplings in my freezer at all times."
2709,"So, i'll start by saying we bought a bag of frozen dumplings and for the most part they were very good.However there was one dumpling i bit into that had a broken piece of plastic in it (see photo). So as much as i want to come back here and give them another review, you'll understand if i cannot."
2710,"Ahhhh this place is amazing! This has been on my list of Chinatown eats forever and we just happened to walk by it one day while hungry. You can literally spend $5 here and fill your belly! The peanut butter sauce noodles were perfect to share for two people, and we got pork and cabbage dumplings as well. It was sooo good. Dumplings were super fresh and juicy, and for such a good price. Will 100% be coming back for all of this."
2711,"DELICIOUS AND CHEAP FOOD. Can't go wrong ordering anything here - soups and dry noodles aka my definition of comfort food.No frills, self-serve, easy to miss. Amazing how they can keep these prices in nyc although no one is complaining.Actually YUMMY food - cheap is a plus. CASH ONLY."
2712,This location has a lot more room for people to dine in. The menu is pretty cheap for 2022. 10 dumplings for 4$ tax is already included. Made fresh when you order. Wait time is about 5minutes.
2713,"Great place to get dumplings! Wonderful and will come back all the time to get my dumpling fix. Also got the peanut wheat noodles, and while good, I would save stomach space to just get more dumplings.Note:Cash only"
2714,"I love coming here to buy frozen pork & chive dumplings. $12 for 50 is such a good deal. Their fishball soup is good too, and only $2.75 for a small!"
2715,"This place serves really good dumplings as the dumpling skin is ""al dente"" . it's like it's got a firm yet supple skin to it. The dumplings itself are pretty meaty as well as it is like 20% larger than your average dumpling that you get frozen. The food comes out extremely fast as well, so you'll be pretty happy.Have a venmo account or bring cash to pay!"
2716,"Oh man. I don't really have much else to add other than encourage you to just try it out for yourself. The reviews are pretty much on point. I had seen this on every food blogger's Instagram in NYC and bookmarked it. I'm in Chinatown a lot and surprised it took me 12 years of living here to try it. However, in my defense, it's a little out of the way, not anywhere near where I do my business in Chinatown. Today I made it a point to go here specifically and I'm really glad I did. I tried the popular wheat noodles in peanut butter sauce and chicken and mushroom dumplings. The noodles are a good portion. If there had been more, I wouldn't have complained. The dumplings were good too, although they weren't anything to write home about. They had a chili oil of sorts on the tables that went great with the dumplings. The two dishes set me back $6.75 which is a stellar deal in my opinion. I'm glad I don't work anywhere near here or I would be 5 times heavier in a short span of time."
2717,They moved location but they still have the most delicious dumplings for amazing price!!  Still my favorite dumplings pork and cabbage are my favorite and they go down so easy.
2718,"I ordered for pick-up for the following items: thick rice noodle with peanut butter sauce ($2.75) and a large size of pork and cabbage dumplings ($4), and these were quite a steal!!I have walked by this spot a lot and seen many ads on Yelp but I did not really think much because I have seen and been to plenty of dumpling spots. I thought that this shop was not going to be any special, yet when I looked at the menu again, I was quite surprised. Everything was cheap and affordable, which made me think that the quality would be compromised. However, based on the many positive reviews, it seemed quite unlikely.I got the noodles and dumpling yesterday for lunch and they were pretty delicious.The noodles were not overpowering with the peanut butter sauce. It was sufficiently nutty (no pun intended) and was still warm after getting the food for pick-up. I am not a fan of peanut butter but this dish was quite a nice snack.The dumplings had a thin skin yet they were very stuffed. I was surprised in the amount of filling, and it was not bland with the meaty taste. I'm not sure if there was soy sauce added in the mixture or if it was meat juice spilling out of the dumplings, but the dumplings strangely tasted different and more appetizing than the ones I had before. Also, the dipping sauce was amazing. It's not the traditional soy sauce; there was an element of spiciness (spicy oil added perhaps; thank god,  no sriracha). The spiciness was sharp and it cleansed my palate. Most dumpling shops or dim sum locations dilute soy sauce or use the original salty soy sauce; however, this dipping sauce changed the game completely.Altogether, I had assumed the two items would become just snacks and not appetizing BUT they were super delicious and refreshing. I wasn't bored from eating ten dumplings (large size) and switching between these two choices coupled with the sauce cleansed my palate for the next bite. Overall, I may return for a second visit to try their other items!!"
2719,"CASH ONLY!!!!!You know the food is good when it makes you miss your hometown. Am I right, or am I right? We had 3. Sour vegetable with noodle soup; 5. Wheat noodle with peanut butter sauce(BOMB) and 7. Wonton soup (you have to add some vinegar in the soup to make it next level, trust me on that). They were all so tasty and enough for the 2 of us.  I almost wished the portion was smaller, so that we could order more things to try.  And 3 only $9.50?!?!?!?! With how expensive everything costs nowadays, this place is definitely a bang for your buck.Why don't we have one like this in the Bay Area??? I'd probably go every week!!!"
2720,pork and chive dumplings 5/5so affordable. 40 cents each. not the biggestbut delicious. tasty. lovely.come!
2721,Great place to satisfy your dumpling cravings!I always order these whenever I'm craving homemade Chinese food or feeling under the weather. All the dumplings taste great. The skin is thin and the filling is flavorful. Soups are light and refreshing. Order the noodle soups if you're looking for something more carb-y. Great meal without breaking the bank!
2722,"MY GOD the value. Getting twenty dumplings and a wonton soup, having it taste good, and it all being $10.75 is simply unbeatable in manhattan. It is only cash only but you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't stop by"
2723,"cash only or venmo!!For $3 for 10 dumplings and noodles for $2.50, I do not know where you are going to get a better deal than that. They offer eat in and also frozen take home for those days that you are just too lazy to cook. The portions are big and you are going to be very full for under $5. For NYC that is going to be hard to beat.I got the pork dumpling and wonton soup. The flavor reminds me of dumplings grandmas would make and it is very tasty."
2724,"Best dumplings I've ever had. Not even exaggerating! I thought I was here for their Buckwheat Noodles (Sesame Noodles), but I devoured the dumplings instead. Pork and chive never fails but these dumplings were special. They're extra plump and so juicy - I can tell they use a lot of fat in them. I enjoyed them so much that I bought 50 frozen ones, and they are so easy to boil at home. I think the total cost of a meal between my friend and I was about $12. This cheap eat is definitely one of the gems in Chinatown. Can't wait to come back!"
2725,This is tasty cheap Chinese food in Chinatown. We got the pork ball soup and the noodles with peanut sauce. For a total of $5 can't beat that! We were able to grab a table at lunch on a Monday but it was pretty packed with a line to the door.
2726,"Wowee Wow!!!Not much to say.Inexpensive, a small menu, popular with the locals, everyone incredibly friendly & welcoming.Pork & Chive dumplings, homemade and very delicious.Wheat noodles in Peanut Butter Sauce, fresh, hot, delicious. Sauce was a little thin but, I left full for $5. So no complaints here, if I'm in the neighborhood, I'll return."
2727,"Wow! This place is not only CHEAP but delicious. **CASH ONLY / indoor dining availableOutside of the restaurant looks a bit run-down, but it's not bad inside. Restroom is clean! haha.We ordered:Wheat noodle with peanut butter saucePork and cabbage dumplings (boiled)Total: $5.50!!! I am SHOOOKED! The wheat noodle was quite bland, but tasted freshly made. It was basically just wheat noodle with peanut butter sauce + soy sauce. If we could add protein for additional cost, that would've been great. It was still good but I wouldn't order again. Dumplings were delicious! I've tried many different kind of dumplings but never had this kind. The seasoning and flavoring were very tasty and different. The two items were pretty filling. I was pretty full for the price of $5.50!Overall, it's worth a try for the value! I would definitely come back to try other stuff."
2728,Visited this place after years and it hit the spot! We got the rice noodle and the wheat noodle with peanut sauce. I love the wheat noodle with the peanut sauce and then adding the chili oil which is at the table. Such a great quick meal for a winter day!
2729,"First time trying their new location! Bigger with more seatings! Had the fan favorite, peanut butter noodles. So affordable, filling, and delicious! Perfect on a cold day, but honestly... I eat it year round! You must pair the noodles with soup. Their wonton soup, fish ball (pork meat in the middle) soup and beef w/ starch soup is so good. Pro tip: add a splash of vinegar to the broths. Fu zhou wontons are smaller but that's how it normally is. This is not a super popular order but the beef w/starch soup is delicious. Don't let the name scare you, it's basically beef in soup. Another must have are the dumplings, this place makes the best boiled dumplings!Each table has a side of sauces: vinegar (remember add it in your broths!), chili oil, soy sauce etc. They have a wall full of photos and names of food so its not confusing!"
2730,"Came here after watching someone on Instagram post that it's really good for cheap in Chinatown.Ordered the peanut noodle, won ton soup and chive dumplings.The peanut noodle was good. I got it with wheat pasta. Not sure if they make the noodle in house but tasted light and fresh. Peanut taste was good but wish there was a little more flavor.The pork and chive dumpling mixed with the chili oil, soy sauce and white vinegar was solid. A good amount of filling in each one. This was my fav dish out the 3.The won ton soup was a fail. Didn't enjoy it. I added some extras- chili oil, soy sauce and it didn't do much to change the taste. I guess I'm used to super wonton Chinese style won ton soup.Overall It was super cheap and a good quick stop. Place is small, could be cleaner, but for china town it is what it is."
2731,"So delicious and inexpensive- ordered 2x wheat peanut noodles, dumplings and wontons for $15"
2732,"Again, another one of my reviews missing - I remembered my previous review I mentioned I was also skeptical coming here to the original location because it looked really sketch and just not a place where I expected to be good.But S mentioned it to me and wanted to come here so I decided to give this place a chance since I never even bothered looking up what this restaurant was all about.Came here to dine in pre-covid and the place was very small but we managed to score a table.We got the peanut butter noodles and dumplings and they're so good.I didn't think I would like the peanut butter noodles, but I was pleasantly surprised and they taste even better with a bit of hot chili oil.I ended up buying frozen dumplings to go.I haven't been to the new location, but I got A to pick up some for me because during the pandemic I missed eating good dumplings and I am not near any authentic Asian restaurants, so these frozen ones are a lifesaver.A told me the new location is brighter and cleaner and bigger!One of the things I miss living in my old hood."
2733,"Saw this place listed on a ""food influencers"" list of best dumplings in Chinatown, so I had to check it out! I got the pork and chive dumplings and the wheat noodles with peanut sauce. The dumplings are soooooooo juicy and moist, the wrapper is just slightly chewy. The noodles were simple and perfect, not overly strong flavors, just enough. This place was very cheap as well! Make sure you have cash, not sure if they take cards. Will definitely come back!"
2734,"If you come here, you have to order the right stuff.  The most popular dishes are #5 and the dumplings. I was NOT a fan of other menu items aside from #5 and the dumplings.Finally, all the menu items are of great value and a good cheap eat in Chinatown."
2735,"Affordable, simple + good food! Everything came in neat containers, good amounts, and the price forget about it!"
2736,"Shu Jiao Fu Zhou takes the crown for best budget eat in NYC. With so many restaurants in NYC continuing to increase their prices, Shu Jiao offers such delicious food for cheap. We tried a few of their different dumplings, as well as the fish ball soup and noodles with peanut butter sauce. The highlight for us honestly was everything, but my fave dish was the dumplings. For the price, they easily could've skimped on the ingredients and the quality, but they were great for the price. Just remember it's cash only. What a great bang for your buck!"
2737,"I love this place! If you're ever in need of a quick and filling meal, please give this place a try. They feature two great items: pork and chive dumplings and peanut butter noodles. For just a few bucks, you get a full plate of boiled dumplings coming out hot and quick. The wrapper is nice and thin and the filling is pretty flavorful. The peanut noods are pretty good too and very filling. This place can get busy, but I'd say the turnover is pretty quick if you're looking for a seat. I also enjoy the vinegar and chili on the side. Hands down one of the best value meals in Manhattan that tastes great!"
2738,"This may not be fine dining or the best place to bring a first date, but you will leave with your stomach (and wallet) happy. It's definitely deserving of 5 stars, considering the quality, price, and service/speed. We literally ordered, sat down, and a few minutes later, our food was ready (they'll call you by number). The food is definitely best eaten hot! Our dumpling wrappers were so thin and the meat was sooo juicy and tender! The peanut noodles were filled with so much sauce and the noodles just melt in your mouth. The restaurant is definitely a no-frills spot meant for a quick bite. As there was a constant flow of customers, it's pretty much expected for customers to eat and leave after they're done (not the best place for a catch-up with buddies).5/5 Definitely recommend for good food that won't break the bank! :D"
2739,"You really can't go wrong here. Super cheap, spacious place to eat, utensils laid out for you, tax free, and  tastes good as well. I went here after paying way too much for food nearby and after eating this, my mood brightened. I ordered the 6 dumplings for 2.75 and I ordered 50 frozen dumplings for $12. A bargain."
2740,"This place is ridiculously cheap. We got 2 bowls of noodles and 1 plate of dumplings for just $13. Really good dumplings but the noodles were kinda bland but they did have a lot of sauces for you to sauce it up to your taste. Overall, for the price tag, this place is really filling and if I lived nearby, I would come just to eat the dumplings everyday lol"
2741,"Easy, quick and cheap. You can get a filling meal for under $7.I would recommend takeout and make sure to ask for chili sauce. This will be a go-to whenever I'm looking for a quick to-go meal while I'm in Chinatown."
2742,"I already ate a half of it. So good. If you never had food here, you don't know what New York cuisine is period"
2743,peanut noodles are the best thing ever. i love them so much and keep coming back. the price for it was amazing!
2744,The best bang for your buck in New York! Great pork and cabbage dumplings and peanut noodles. Knocking off one star because the dumplings stuck to the paper plate they came on and some paper ended up coming with the dumplings into my mouth.
2745,"Probably one of the best examples of a true NYC cheap-eats restaurant that is lower on the radar compared to other Chinatown mainstays. I do not believe there is anything on the menu that is more expensive than $5.I also like their dumplings a lot better than Vanessa's; not only are their wrappers much thinner and more silken, but they also give you much more at a way cheaper price. Noodles with peanut butter sauce is a must-try if you haven't tried this combination before.During COVID, I placed my order outside of a makeshift booth at the entrance, and then waited outside for my name to be called."
2746,Wheat noodles with peanut butter sauce -   ($2.75) I decided to try this because the Fung bros hyped it up. It was just alright. Basically watered down peanut butter sauce and lot of oil. I mean it's cheap but it was also just soso.CASH OR VENMO ONLY.
2747,"Their dumplings are SO GOOD. Got their small pork & cabbage dumplings - coming out steaming hot, chunky, and substantive. Each bite you taste the juiciness of the pork and the umami-ness of the cabbage. Wraps were just the right level of thickness. Eat them with vinegar & chili flakes - the best combination in the world!!! For the main, I got their beef tripe wheat noodle soup. Also came out steaming hot - the amount of tripe in there was generous. Even more generous in the amount of noodles given. Had a fresh, delicious and affordable experience. Will definitely be back."
2748,"Haven't been here for ages and mostly forgot about it, but it's great! Changed location and upgraded the inside, it's no longer dingy and falling apart - there's now proper tables and chairs and lighting, much cleaner feeling too. Surprisingly, prices haven't raised at all in the last two (or more) years, no idea how! My go-to is the large pork and cabbage dumplings which comes with ten pieces along with the peanut butter noodles. Cash only, $6.75 including tax for it all, amazing! The only downside of this place is the excessive use of plastic, which is actually what ""shu jiao"" in the name of the restaurant is. I guess that's how they're able to keep the costs low, but it's really awful for the environment."
2749,"Have you ever been to a bar and wish you could be a regular there? Befriended the bartenders that remember your nickname and your usual drink order as you walked in?That's me to Shu Jiao Fu Zhou. Except instead of drinks, it's peanut noodle and dumplings. And instead of a bartender, it's an uncle.Shu Jiao Fu Zhou is literally a hole in the wall. It's a specialized noodle and dumpling place that can be a hangover cure. The place is small but it can fit a decent amount of customers to dine in (prob 10-15 people). Been coming here since 2017 when the peanut noodle still costs $2.50 (I know right? How dare they raised the price to $2.75 now?!?!)Anyway, dish recommendations:1. PEANUT NOODLEIt's a delicious thin noodle with peanut butter sauce. No, it's not your regular skippy peanut butter spread. It's peanut and butter sauce, a common savory Fu Zhou dish. PRO TIP: eat it fresh while it's still steamy and don't wait too long.2. Pork and chive dumplingsSuperior dumplings. The dumplings that other steam dumplings in the city should look up to. Thin skin, generous filling that is juicy and rich in flavor. Don't forget to drench them with the soy vinegar dumpling sauce.3. Fishball soupI'm not sure why this dish is less popular and underrated. The broth is good and the (S) has 6 fishball with pork fillings. Whenever I feel my noodle started to get cold and too sticky, I just pour some of the broth to it and make it warm again. Winning.I must say I miss dining in in here because to me, the peanut noodle tastes the best when it's served on a plate. There's nothing wrong with the to-go container, it's just the sauce is already mixed while I like to mix it on my own.Really worried that the pandemic affected them badly but the uncle told me they still managed. And when I came here last week the uncle also told me that they're moving to a new location (see pic) which is a block a way I think lol and they'll open for dine in soon! So excited to be back."
2750,"Obao is amazing! It feels like a nightclub, and the vibes are so great in here. The drinks are fantastic -- try the Spring Emotions!"
2751,"Food was the best, came for my friends birthday. Baitong, Palm and Pom provided the best service, made wonderful recommendations and had us laughing the whole time. Highly recommend everything on the menu was fresh and delicious."
2752,Delicious steamed dumplings and drunken noodles. Should totally try their comrade party. Super unusual but tasty!
2753,"Came here with my gf on a cold Saturday evening for dinner. We were able to squeeze in a reservation spot that freed up last minute. We were seated on the first floor, but at a table the closed to the wall. It was a super tight squeeze between other diners. I ordered a cocktail called 1001 Nights ($10), which consisted of gin, fresh blueberries muddled with palm sugar, lemon juice, and Fragoli strawberry liqueur. Fruity sweet drink that tastes great.We started off with Sambal Spiced Calamari ($10) as appetizers. Pretty standard fried calamari served with onions and scallions. The dipping sauce was okay, but I liked the calamari without it.For entrees, I ordered the Short Ribs Massaman Curry ($26), which consisted of a 2 hr braised grass-fed short ribs, roasted sweet potato, shallot, dills, and peanuts topped with crispy shallot. This was simply amazing. The sauce is phenomenal when poured over the side of rice. The short ribs falls apart very nicely. I ended up taking this back home with me for another day. Highly recommend.My gf ordered the Pho Bo ($16), which consisted of 12 hrs cooked beef broth, thin sliced rare beef, brisket, and thin rice noodles served with side of bean sprouts, jalapeno, and lime wedge. The beef broth is super rich. Everything else is what you'd expect in a standard pho.What was not on the menu were Happy Hour Oysters ($1.50 each). You would have not known about this unless you view their Instagram page. We found out as an adjacent table ordered a dozen. They have this everyday 11:30AM - 6PM. We ended up ordering a half dozen.The one thing I had an issue with was how long the food took to get to us. We were one of the first parties to sit down and order. Four other tables filled up and ended up getting their food well before we did. I even order the oysters thinking it would come out immediately while we were waiting for our entrees. They ended up taking just as long as the entrees did. It was also very hard for us to get service due to where our table was situated, crammed by the wall with other tables set up super close to us. Besides this, food was amazing and I'd stop by again."
2754,"Bookmarked for the longest, I finally had a chance to stop by OBAO for a quick weeknight dinner with the Hubs a few weeks ago. Happy hour was in full swing and  it seemed everyone had a drink in hand.  We ordered the kimchi fries to share and although I didn't try the entire menu on my first visit, I'm convinced it's one of OBAO's best offerings.  Seriously crunchy (possibly twice fried) but not greasy.  Just the right amount of sweet and savory.  Sriracha mayo and kimchi provide just the right mix of spicy tanginess and texture.  Fries, elevated, who wouldn't love these?I ordered the vegan sautéed Vegetables  bu'n filled with stir fried mixed vegetables, bean sprouts, soy dressing, and peanuts served with soy sham sauce.  Super flavorful, light and addictive!  There was so much food, I had to take home the leftovers because I couldn't eat anymore.  Hubs ordered the shrimp Pad Thai which was topped with a quite decorative poached egg.  We had the OBAO Sunray cocktail (vodka | coconut rum | lime juice | Thai chili | ginger purée) which was strong, spicy and sweet, I could easily knock back a few of them at happy hour pricing! $10 instead of $15)The restaurant doesn't look large from the front but there's more seating in the back. Fun place for a date or night out with friends.  We'll definitely be back!"
2755,"Food was great! This place always seems to be packed and for good reason. Got the pad see ew and it was delicious. I do have to say that it was a bit on the oily side for me. But the food came out quick and service was great. So close to home, will be coming here again!"
2756,"This is a fancy place that was relatively busy when we went. We were seated pretty quickly though, in around 10 minutes. However, the tables are crammed super near each other so that you barely have a foot in between each seat. They do check your vaccination cards, but it was a little cramped for my taste. The atmosphere is great, and there were mostly people going on dates. The staff told us that someone had placed a reservation for the whole row of back tables, so we had to finish eating in 45 minutes. That was more than enough time though. We ordered the Pho Ga and Basil Fried Rice. The pho was top tier and their portions are huge. The basil fried rice is a little spicy and slightly sweet and has shrimp inside. With the pho ga, you also get bean sprouts, cilantro, and shrimp paste of some sort. The food is really high quality and both the dishes are mildly spicy. I personally thought the fried rice was a little more spicy than the pho, if you don't drink the broth. Service was super quick and our dishes only took around 10 minutes to get to us. This was DURING dinner rush, and they had almost no empty tables! Awesome staff and waiters. Their bathroom is clean and so is the entire restaurant. A lovely aura and great location!"
2757,Obao is a pretty good spot for all types of Asian style cuisine. Mainly Vietnamese and a bit of Thai. We ordered the:VIETNAMESE CRISPY SPRING ROLLS - hard to mess up spring rolls. MUSHROOM DUMPLINGS - tasted frozen but still edible. BÚN BÒ HUE - delicious soup. Only critic is that the posts was a bit too tough. BÒ LÚC LẮC - steak was delicious as well as the sauce. But they did over cook the steak. VIETNAMESE ICED COFFEE - always a winner. This place just saying pretty much always a great spot to have dinner at. Also a epic first date place.
2758,"Petite Thai and Vietnamese fusion spot. We ordered theDRUNKEN NOODLES: stir fried large flat noodles, sliced chicken, egg, bird's eye chilies, kaffir lime leaves, Thai basil leaves, young pepper cornsPAD SEE IEW: stir fried large flat noodles, New Zealand grass-fed beef, egg, and Chinese broccoli served with pickled jalapenosI would definitely come back when it is less packed"
2759,"Lots of good flavors each dish.Papaya salad was average but refreshingDumplings were dry and blandLobster was a bit over cookedPad see eew noodles were soft like housemadeCrab fried rice clean and plentiful of crabMassaman curry short ribs, flavor was comforting but ribs good go longer.Overall happy they serve until 11pm but 10:30pm last call includes alcohol, zonk for that."
2760,"My friends and I went on a Saturday night. We waited awhile to get seated even though I had a reservation.. Waiting area is definitely not spacious and we were feeling crowded while standing. When we got seated, it was always so hard to get the waiter's attention. Getting our water, putting our orders in, and especially getting the check was so hard. The food took a bit to come out as well.. My pad thai definitely was more warm than hot. Maybe it was because they were waiting to give all our dishes to come out at the same time.. Everything tasted great, and the ambiance is pretty good (at a certain time at night they dim the lights even more) but the service made the experience a bit difficult."
2761,"We were looking for a place to eat near Hell's Kitchen during the fall, and found this spot with enticing menu. The inside was not huge, but not small either. I liked the high ceiling that gives the feeling of larger space.We were there for an early dinner, during their Happy Hour, so we started off with cocktails. We ordered Flunk Flink was delicious, I could have it everyday! Obao Sunray had a great ginger flavor. Very flavorful drink!For appetizer, we ordered Spare Ribs with Honey Tamarind Glaze. The ribs were so tender and juicy, fell off the bone! We also ordered Vietnamese Chicken Wings with Crispy Garlic. The wings had the super crunchy exterior, holding the super juicy meat! Finger-licking-good!For main, we ordered Lobster Pad Thai. It was a nice large portion, with a big lobster protecting its delicious treasure. The only thing about this dish is that it is not easy to eat the lobster with just the fork and chopsticks provided to us... I prefer the lobster meat separated from the shells, and then placed it back just for the presentation. Otherwise a nice dish.I wanted a rice dish, so I ordered The Crab Fried Rice. It had jumbo pieces of crab meat in there. They were plump and flavorful. We enjoyed this dish a lot! We added another cocktail order and tried Fig-A-Tini and Buiseberry Mojito. They were both tasty, although the mojito was a bit too sweet for me. When we were finishing up with our food and drinks, our server came over with last call for happy hour drinks. I thought that was very considerate, as we are not always looking at our watch.We had a great dinner here. Good drinks, delicious food, and super friendly and polite staff. Our server took a very good care of us. We enjoyed every bite, and we were very happily full. The portion of the dishes were generous amount, so we did take some food home. I would love to go back and order more of their enticing menu items!"
2762,"Five stars!!! Everything was so good. We grabbed the last reservation on a Tuesday evening - 8:15 - and when we left there were tons of people still waiting to be sat. We loved that the menu was so clearly labeled GF and V - gluten free and vegan. Our waitress even checked with us to see if there were food allergies. We ordered the crispy chicken wings and the papaya salad to share. Amazing!!!! My kids and I decided we all were in the mood for pad thai with shrimp - medium spicy - so we ordered two orders of it and split it between the three of us. If we hadn't eaten appetizers, the amount would have been perfect for one person. Highly recommend. The place was bustling and fun and our appetizers came out quickly. As did my amazing cocktail."
2763,"TL;DR a little overpriced but decent foodFood (4/5) - Pad Thai was a little spicy, as it should be!! The egg was a nice touch :) noodles were just a little on the sticky side.Green curry was on the spicier side but also very good, the rice portion that came with it was a little too small to finish the whole dish. The chicken was pretty soft and tender.The duck noodle was very good, halfway between a soup noodle and stir fry. Probably the best thing we had on the menu. The meat was flavorful and soft, and the noodles were just right.Prices (3/5) - for these portions and the taste, the prices were a tad high ($40 per person) but it's midtown, so what can you really expect?Ambiance (3/5) - a little on the loud side even on a weekday, and it was pretty crowded. Service was prompt but also pretty hurried.There is a bar area and the drinks looked really cute (lychee cocktails anyone?) but we didn't really get a chance to try them out."
2764,"Okay, I booked it because it had a lot of great reviews and it was close to the theatre my gf and I were going to. After I booked it I was a little hesitant that it would be another overhyped ""Asian fusion"" restaurant with more of a party vibe than good food. But it wasn't!!! The food didn't come out instantly but it came out fairly quick and the service was pretty good. We ordered the mushroom dumplings which had a fun soft texture and great flavors with it. The calamari portion was a little small but very good, the fish sauce in the sauce gave it a fun kick.For main courses we ordered the roasted duck noodles, spicy lemongrass short ribs, and massaman curry short ribs. The two short ribs dishes were completely different flavors and textures (massaman was a soft, melt in your mouth short rib) and the lemongrass was a grilled, thinner slice. Everything was so good and I liked that we chose 3 dishes that brought something different to the table in one meal."
2765,"The food and flavor combinations might leaving you saying ""Ob-waow""!  Tried some delicious lychee and ginger infused cocktails; shrimp and chicken dumplings for appetizer, crab meat fried rice and duck over noodles for main courses. Every thing was super flavorful with appropriate portion size. The crabmeat friedrice may look seemingly bland, but it's packed with great flavors and a decent amount of crab meat. All meals could have used some more spice but that's obviously a matter of personal preference.What I love about Obao is their expeditious (without being uninviting) efficient, attentive and super friendly service.  Servers were willing to offer recommendations and ours even reminded us about that happy hour was about to end.I'm going back soon!"
2766,"Came here because of the reviews and ratings but we had the strangest experience. We were told 10 minutes until we could be seated, then we're told 30 minutes. When we were seated, half way through our meal, we were asked to move tables. When we agreed to move, no one helped us move our dishes. The food was ok, but very strange environment. Will not go back."
2767,"Absolutely loved the food and the music at this restaurant. It was also packed on a weeknight, so you can tell it's a hotspot! For drinks, we got Bruiseberry Mojito (rum, seasonal berries, lime juice) and One Thousand and One Nights (gin, fresh blueberries muddled with palm sugar, lemon juice, Fragoli strawberry liqueur). Both were really good, but I think the mojito was the winner for me! For appetizers, we got Vietnamese Crispy Spring Rolls (pork, shrimp, taro, mushrooms, sesame oil served with pickled carrots and daikon) And Spareribs with honey tamarind glaze. The ribs were HUGE! The spring rolls were crispy and stuffed! For entrees, we got Pad Thai (stir fried thin rice noodle with shrimp, bean sprouts, chives, and crushed peanuts; topped with a poached egg) and BÒ LÚC LẮC (seared New Zealand grass - fed beef cube, onion, tomatoes, and lettuce). Both were very delicious! The pad Thai had so many amazing textures. We will definitely be back!"
2768,"Showed up to Obao on a busy Saturday night before a show. The location is perfect to visit before a show, and many of the folks seated nearby also had a show to attend.  When we arrived there was a wait despite having a reservation. In order to accommodate us, they actually opened a closed section of the restaurant to ensure we were seated quickly. Talk about great service!  Our amazing waiter, Baitong, was super attentive and ensured we had everything we needed in time to enjoy our dinner and make it to our destination. The food was absolutely delightful. The garlicky, sweet steamed dumplings were dense and delicious. Our noodle dishes were filled with spice and flavor.  They were a great balance!  The drinks were well made and strong but flavorful. Fantastic all around. I will definitely be adding Obao to my favorite dinner spots in NYC. I highly recommend it!"
2769,"We went here on Sunday (2/20), and it was on a whim to escape the cold weather. The food was good! My pho (with veggies and tofu) didn't have broccoli, which was nice. Kalbi was tasty and served on a nice hot plate. The noodles hit the spot. I recommend the spring rolls! Something we didn't know was the size of the sake. The single glass is quite large. It was perfect for a cold day. The service was excellent! The staff is very attentive and really cares about the quality of their restaurant. I'll be back."
2770,Sat us down almost right away with our reservations. Tables were kinda a little extra too tight together. I mean maybe less than a foot between the couple next to us which was slightly uncomfortable. Food was good. However prime time on a week night and they didn't have any curry which was odd. However other dishes were solid. Nothing out of this world but solid nonetheless. Also interesting they play modern pop music at a Thai restaurant. It's a vibe I guess.
2771,"Food: By far my favorite dish is their pho bò! I've been here multiple times and each time I try a different dish that they offer however I seem to want to always just stick with their pho bò! they also have an option to add on short ribs- taking the dish up another level! Cost: The cost was on the average to slightly higher range. I think depending on the depending on the dish, some dish was worth the price and some could have been skipped. Overall, the cost is not too much of a deterrent to come back. Environment: it doesn't look like it but once you go inside there is a decent amount of room out in the back. The inside is clean, bright, and does not feel too cramped. I enjoyed both eating inside and outside this past year.Service: Everyone was very nice, there were no difficulties putting in orders or waiting too long to receive what we have ordered as well.Uniqueness: located in Hells kitchen, this restaurant is definitely a must try. Especially their pho bò and if you're feeling adventurous add on the short ribs!"
2772,"A classic Thai spot. The decor is so cute both downstairs and upstairs. The service is extremely friendly, and above and beyond. Tony, Ken, and Koiteen were great servers who made our dinner even more pleasant.Highly recommend the mushroom dumplings for appetizers. The pad thai was also delicious and overall all the entrees were tasty."
2773,"First time at this beautiful and cozy place. But nevertheless the best customer service from Tony. Super friendly and professional. Expert with their menu.Obao must be very lucky to have him at this restaurant. Staff are friendly, attentive and kept our table clean. All empty plates are removed quickly,  frequent checks for our drinks. We ordered loads of foods. Everything was perfect to our palate. Food are amazing.  Clean and creative. I HIGHLY received this place.  You'll have a great time with Tony if you get lucky to have him as your server."
2774,"Ambiance 10/10 - Lovely ambiance, perfect for a girls night out or a date night!Food 10/10 - Oh my gosh. The food was amazing. We got Drunken Noodles, Sparerib, Kimchi Fries, and Bo Loc Lac. Come for their Happy Hour and do 1.50$ oysters and discounted drinks!Service 10/10 - Tony was our server and he was excellent! Great recommendations, he anticipated our needs, and was very prompt with everything!Reservation is highly recommended as the restaurant was completely full when we got here."
2775,"PLEASE get the short rib curry, my boyfriend and I unanimously agreed it was one of the best dishes we have ever had in our lives.  The crispy ribs were delicious as well, was not too happy with the dumplings - they were rather dense?  They're open late, which works fabulously for post-Broadway show dinners!"
2776,"My boyfriend and I each got the first pho on the menu and it was good, not mind blowing but still really decent. Really enjoyed that the food came out very quickly and the service was very speedy yet friendly. Was able to come for the happy hour deals as well so we got our Sapporos at a good price. I liked the ambiance of the place -- it's trendy, Asian fusion vibes (and I've been there before for Thai which was also good) -- I just did not like how we were seated so squished in between large parties. I kept getting bumped by the waitress trying to squeeze into a tight space to serve another party of 15 people while I was just with my date. It was uncomfortable and I just wish they sat us elsewhere or just didn't have that table there awkwardly in the middle on the first floor towards the back. *Review: 3.5 stars rounding down to 3*"
2777,"Expect to wait in a tight area, front of the entrance until the entire party shows up. Eventually the hostess let us (party of 5) get seated even though we were waiting on one friend because more people were coming through. I am sad I didn't take photos of the food, but my favorites were beef pad see-ew and chicken pad thai. Fried calamari was good too, but it is a very small dish. About 2 people can enjoy it. We were seated upstairs close to the bathrooms. They have 2 individual bathrooms towards the back.Overall the service is good, but it gets busy pretty fast. We enjoyed the cocktails as well: One Thousand One Nights. I would say the ambiance is beautiful. A good spot for a date or a celebration."
2778,"There's a lot of thai places now that I feel pretty indifferent towards since there isn't anything special, but OBAO exceeded all my expectations. Staff was amazing, ambience was perfect for a dinner with friends, plenty of tables, and the food was AMAZING.We got a few appetizers which were great but nothing that blew my mind. The safe bets to go for are the papaya salad, egg rolls, and the calamari. The real stars of the show were the entrees. But the main one I want to talk about is the Duck Noodles. Because i am still dreaming about them!! The duck was so soft it could melt in your mouth, extremely savory and had a great sauce to it. It paired perfectly with the noodles and was my favorite food from my entire Ny trip. Definitely recommend this place and DEFINITELY get the duck noodles you won't regret it :)"
2779,"Had a reservation and got there a bit early but still got seated right away. Good size menu with options for most I think. Started with the kimchi fries and spare ribs, both were good but wish the glaze was a bit stickier to coat the ribs more. Had the crispy pork belly with Chinese broccoli, kalbi short ribs and drunken noodles. Our least favorite was the short rib, seasonless and bland compared to the others. Favorite was the drunken noodles - spicy and filling but delish. Dinner felt awfully rushed, but we're not in the city often to eat so maybe that's normal? Like I'm bringing the fork to my mouth with a bite and they're asking if we're done with the dish kind of rush. There was a wait at the bar and door, so maybe that's just how they turn tables quickly in the a Saturday night. I'd recommend it if someone was looking for a place in the area, but with so many great places in Hell's kitchen and no superstar dish, I'm not sure we'll be back."
2780,"What an amazing find while we were visiting NYC the weekend after Thanksgiving. Once we arrived in Manhattan, I yelped for restaurants in the area. Turns out I had already bookmarked this restaurant (and I don't remember doing so at all). I must have read an article a while ago for me to save this. Anyways, it was one of the best dining experiences we've had. We ordered 3 appetizers for our main: steamed dumplings with chili soy sauce, Vietnamese chicken wings with crispy garlic and amazing dipping sauce, spare ribs with honey tamarind glaze and an order of crab fried rice with spicy green sauce & chili fish sauce. Each sauce complemented the dish really well, and we can't get enough of it. I must say the chef de saucier at OBAO is truly a master of mixing & pairing spices that make dishes truly delectable. Hubby and I were very impressed with how delicious everything was. From the excellent service to the oh-so-scrumptious food that was laid out in our small table, it's 5++.Some restaurants post beautiful photos of their specials but once it is served, they don't look as good as the photo does. At OBAO, what they served us looked exactly like what was posted on their website. We cannot wait to come back in the spring time as there's a lot of other items on the menu that we would love to try. Actually, we want to try them all so that will take multiple trips, lol. I just read the owner's profile and they are cousins Chai & Ace. Kudos to you two - for melding excellent Thai & Vietnamese dishes together at OBAO. Please, please, please open one in Southern CA ."
2781,"Obao, more like oh wow!! (Sorry I just had to).Okay, anyone who knows me knows I absolutely love Asian food, more specifically Thai food. Obao is a place that offers Thai and Vietnamese food (and top quality food as well). My boyfriend and I ordered the pad see ew and the pad thai. I've had many pad thais in my life and this one was top notch. They only offer shrimp pad thai so you won't have the option of choosing unfortunately but it was definitely worth it. It was tender, juicy, and so flavorful. The pad see ew was not as good as the pad thai but still had tender noodle pieces. Prices for the entrees are around your typical city prices. We loved the drinks we got at Obao. When we went, there was a special drink price so you could order any cocktail for $10. We definitely did not sleep on that opportunity and you shouldn't either. The drinks were strong but sweet, just the way I prefer it.The only down side to the delicious meal was the dessert. They have a partnership with Spot Dessert Bar so I had very high standards ordering the matcha butter mochi dessert. Unfortunately, I was highly disappointed. Not only was the dessert expensive, but the butter mochi did not melt in your mouth. In fact, it was hard and they gave 2 little pieces of mochi and 2 red beans (literally two pieces) as decor. It was very underwhelming and not worth the price. I would skip out on the dessert next time. Decor is beautifully done inside the restaurant and the ambience and service were another plus as well. Overall, I'd definitely come back to try some of the other dishes here. Ambience: 5/5Price: 3/5Food: 4/5"
2782,"Vegan bun: didn't really enjoy it.I was excited to try Obao after seeing pictures of the cute interior and the various Asian dishes they offer... the interior really is warm and inviting, with dim lighting and hanging lightbulbs enclosed in wooden cages. There was also enough space between tables so you didn't feel cramped up against your neighbors.Obao offers a variety of Thai and Vietnamese dishes. It'd be a while since I had a satisfying bowl of bun, so I ordered the vegan bun bowl. I added a spring roll on top for $3.The food came out pretty quickly and it was plated nicely. It was a huge bowl of food with plenty of veggies. I was disappointed once I started eating.. the noodles were chopped into short pieces. Half the fun for me is biting into long strands of vermicelli. I also really, really did not enjoy the sauce. It was super sour when I was expecting a golden, light and sweet nuoc mam.However, I did like the tofu that was included in my bun. It had a lot of flavor and was soft inside. If I could order a dish with rice and just the tofu I think I would be happy. The spring roll was just ok.My boyfriend enjoyed his dish order of roasted duck noodles.The service was good, and our waiter was happy to offer suggestions from the menu. Sometimes we had to ask for things multiple times, but it was easy to flag down the waiters even though it was busy.I think this place is really cute and seems to offer a lot on its menu. It was nice to try, but if I came back I would get a different dish..."
2783,"FOOD: Yes, upgrade to the lobster pad thai. Regular pad thai is great, BUT GET THE LOBSTER PAD THAI. Well worth the cost and it tastes bombbbb. Huge menu with lots to choose from, honestly, I wish I had 3 stomachs to try it all. Worth revisiting just because so many dishes taste amazing. AMBIANCE: Stunning indoor decor. A little snug but still enough personal space. Better for small groups and dates than large gatherings. SERVICE: Super quick witted staff. They notice you needing something right away and checks in on you in between as well! TIP: Recommend having a reservation and eating early! Place can get super crowded!"
2784,"Loved the atmosphere here- though it's a small space, the decor is super hip and modern. Their drink menu is also really impressive. If only I had the tolerance, I would have ordered everything off the drink menu ... lol. I tried the spicy obao and the one thousand and one nights drink (which was my fav). In fact, I probably could have that drink one thousand and one times and not be sick of it hahaha Tried the spring rolls and the pad Thai, which were both really good. This place just has really solid food- I feel like you can't go wrong with ordering anything off the menu. Our waiter Baitong was great, and really all the staff we encountered were really accommodating. So all in all, no complaints! Overall, Obao is a super solid place. I would come back here!!"
2785,"Came here with a group of 8 people and sat in the back. The service was excellent. I ordered the Thai ice tea, which was a bit sweet but delicious. I wanted to order the curry but they did not have the option to reduce the spicy level to mild or low. A friend of mine, who is from Bangkok, ordered the curry and found it too spicy even for her! Good thing I didn't order it. I ended up going with the vermicelli - portion was large, but very tasty. I'd definitely like to come back and try the other Thai dishes when I get a chance."
2786,"You might not notice this spot, especially if you're not venturing out of time square, but I promise it's worth it! We were in the mood for some pho, and Obao popped up. It was very busy, but they seated us (without a reservation) so quickly! The restaurant itself has a great atmosphere, definitely not something you'd find in the more populated areas of the city. Great food & great service"
2787,"The environment is really nice. A good place to chillThumbs up for the Thai ice teas, a definitely order The pork belly was as good as I expected. The skin is crispy but the lower layer meat is dry and hard to chew The juice on the bottom is so tasty! Love it! . U may want to order another rice for  the juice lolOverall, I like it. Next time I will try different dishes. Maybe noodle. They have happy hour for oyster. Check it out The service is really good. The waitress are very kind and willing to spend time to explain  and give you recommendations"
2788,"Was expecting some really good food, but we were disappointed. Calamari was a little bland. Kimchi fries were nice and warm, but not much kimchi topping. Crispy pork belly pad kaprow could've been brought out sooner. It was crispy and very dry. Pad see iew was too sweet for me and the beef was very chewy. A big bottle of hand sanitizer on the bar counter... too bad you can't reach it over the person sitting in front of it. All the staff were wearing mask and a few were wearing gloves. Place was a bit warm and loud even at 6 pm on a Thursday night."
2789,"we went on new year's eve and there was no line ehe at 8 pmwhat we got (in order of favorites):1. pad kee mao (5/5 yums): WOW. was spicy and flavorful and the noodles really soaked up the sauce very well. it was a good portion and was salty, but not too salty2. pad thai (5/5 yums): probably would rank this the same as the pad kee mao. it is on the sweeter side but they gave SO MANY SHRIMPS. it was so good and the egg on top gave it an added creaminess3. pork and shrimp on top of vermicelli (5/5): the shrimp and pork had a char taste and was grilled to perfection. the noodles weren't chewy and were a little bit like crunchy but was still good4. pho ga: DONT GET THIS. had no pho taste and the noodles tasted packaged af. dont.5. thai iced tea YAY was so good but so much ice6. we got a blueberry mojito cocktail i think and my mom thought it was really good and it wasn't too sweet"
2790,"Came here for the first time this evening with two friends. The ambiance was really beautiful, the dumplings were really really good! We ordered 2 more after the first! And the duck noodles and the Vietnamese pork chops were delicious! We tried several of the signature drinks and they were all really tasty. If you're in the area feel free to come by!"
2791,"I really don't give out 5 star reviews, but OBAO definitely deserves it... The quality of their food, the ambiance, and their service were just top notch. We also went during happy hour, and agh, their drinks were so fun and SO good. We got a couple classic main plates and drinks to share, and they did not disappoint. I will say that their high ratings and quality does make it a slightly pricier restaurant, but that's pretty normal in the area, so what do you expect? We ordered drunken noodles and a fried rice which were just slightly above average, but the ambiance and their DRINKS were what really differentiated them from anywhere else! We tried Flunk Flink and One Thousand & One Night and wow, I'm really picky when it comes to drinks but these were dangerously too good... Definitely a must visit when you're in the area!"
2792,"Had a reservation here with my family on a Tuesday night a couple days before Christmas -- got seated relatively quickly. The decor of the place is absolutely stunning -- very dark with light pieces scattered, and an artistically lit giant Buddha statue in the back of the restaurant. The server was quite accommodating and attentive despite the relatively busy night. We ordered shrimp pad thai, duck noodles, and pad see ew. While the presentation of the dishes were nice, the food was quite disappointing. The duck noodles in particular were lacking flavor; the only seasoning I could taste was sugar, and the duck was indiscernible from the taste of chicken. The shrimp pad thai and chicken pad see ew also did not have great flavors. At least the portions were filling!Unfortunately, while the interior aesthetic was nice to sit in, the food was sub-par and so I don't think I would ever come back to Obao."
2793,"Came after a matinee viewing of Dear Evan Hansen since it was just a quick walk down the street. We didn't have a reservation but were able to get right in even though it was pretty crowded. We started with the Comrade Party and One Thousand and One Nights for drinks. We preferred the Comrade Party - the Nights was a little on the sweet side for me. Kimchi fries and steamed dumplings were both great apps. For dinner we shared the Pad Thai with Shrimp and Short Rib Massaman Curry - SO GOOD! The curry has a rich taste, and the meat was very tender. Both portions were huge. We were pretty full so we had plenty of leftovers to take home with us. The servers are very attentive and friendly as well. An overall positive experience."
2794,"Still my go to restaurant when I'm dreaming of pho. Ambiance is great and the food is consistently good. Happy hour is from 11 to 5? And it includes cocktails, wine, beer, sake and their lunch special includes a free appetizer off of that menu. They also have $1.50 oysters during happy hour. Service is always friendly. Will continue to come back."
2795,This is my favorite restaurant so far. The food is great and the ambiance is great. The waitress has been truly accommodating and abides by COVID standards. Would def come back again and would def recommend to all of my friends. Had the crab fried rice and kimchi fries. def recommend.
2796,"Went here based on prior reviews of good food and service. Well, the food was good and out quickly but the service from the wait person was horrible and honestly, felt like it was motivated by something that we weren't aware of, but as brown people we're used to this shady questionable treatment in some spaces. Anyway, let's get to what was witnessed. He checked on the tables to the left, right, and back of us three to four times and never asked if we needed anything after we ordered apps and drinks, not did he come back to see if the food was good. Guess he assumed we did not want to order more drinks or place entree orders as initially stated since I was trying to decide what I wanted but knew our app orders. Like, dude, we were in your direct line of vision and I raised my hand to try and get his attention. But nope. Never going back although I'm in the area many times a year and was looking forward to several dishes. Also, will not recommend. Just disappointed all around by a supposedly good Vietnamese spot being so dismissive of patrons."
2797,"Dropped by on a Wednesday night (630pm) since I was going to see a show around the area. It was pretty crowded already but I managed to snag a seat at the bar (I came alone, 2 person table would have been a 30 min wait). I got the spicy lemongrass kalbi short ribs (which came out pretty quickly). The meat was pretty tender and definitely tasted a hint of lemongrass in the sauce. It wasn't very spicy at all (noticed it wasn't marked Spicy on the menu, even though it's in the name) - but does have a little spice if you bite into one of the peppers. Overall a pretty good kalbi with sauteed onions, but not sure if I agree with the Michelin recommendation for this dish.. It wasn't super flavorful (maybe if they kept the bone in? It was boneless), but still good and no major complaints at all.I do hear a lot about the crispy pork belly here so I'll have to try that next time!"
2798,"Lovely service and good food. Big portions and the drinks were great (would recommend). Tried the pad see ew and pad Thai and dumplings as an app. Seemed to also have nice outdoor seating, as well. Enjoyed the interior decor."
2799,"Happy hour here is sooo worth it! The Lychee drink (Flunk Flink) will never disappoint.When in NY, I'll definitely be backCheers!"
2800,Delicious food and good service . Tony is the best waiter. We have a birthday celebration here and they are good for big party and also very nice ambiance. Food are amazing. They also have happy hours even on sat. I am strongly recommend this place . The best Thai restaurant ever!
2801,"Beautiful.I loved my cocktail and the food was so flavorful!!Great service and we were able to enjoy the ambiance, this Vietnamese/ Thai inspired meal/menu was too much deliciousness to be able to describe in a review. The pho, the pad see ew and my dumplings were alll delightful. I had one of the house cocktails and it literally was so good I had to get another one!!Lucky for the locals who get to come here- I have to wait until I'm in New York again."
2802,"We went to Oboa for my birthday and it was an awesome choice. The food was delicious. I highly recommend the crispy duck noodles and the Oboa cocktail. We all ordered different dishes and everything was wonderful. The staff was so friendly and helped make my day so special. Shout out to Baitong, Pom, and Palm are the best!!! I will be back!"
2803,"Great drinks, great food, and the server was amazing!! Also great location!! I had the mushroom dumplings, crispy fried pork and rice, and the pho - BUN BO HUE!"
2804,"Decided to come here for our last night in New York and so glad we did! For same day reservations we were able to get a table for 4 at 8:45pm on a Sunday. 3 of us ordered the khao soi with crispy duck leg and it was probably the best khao soi I've had. The portion was huge, there was a ton of meat on the duck leg and I was able to save half for the next day.  Definitely get this dish if you love duck, pickled veggies, and egg noodles! My friend also got the duck noodles and it resembled a pad see ew - also really tasty. This restaurant checks for proof of vaccination."
2805,It's our firts time in OBAO we are already planning when to comeback!!! Tony was our food server very helpful and accommodating! He also takes good photos for insta!!! Lovelllllyyy food! Mouth watering! Perfect umami. I will continue to eat and update later! You should come and try it for yourself guys!!!
2806,"Great spot for yummy eats in Hells Kitchen area. We had appointment at 7:45pm and we were seated kinda quick. I was worried with the crowd inside we would be waiting for a while but good thing we made reservations. I RECOMMEND YOU MAKE RESERVSTION. I would give this restaurant a 5 star but the food took really long to come. They brought both appetizers and entrees out at the same time leaving no room on the table. We ordered apps 20 before entree and both came out together. The food was excellent though and came out hot. The crispy pork was amazing. It was already spicy and told waitress to make it more spicy but I probably shouldn't have told her that lol. The wings and kimchi were crispy, great flavor. The lobster and beef pad thai were both delicious and were authentic.  I for sure would come back!!"
2807,"Nice happy hour prices. The drinks were pretty good. For a Vietnamese place, this was lacking in flavor. I got the Bun Bo Hue and it definitely wasn't very spicy and felt like the held back on the flavors. My gf got the lobster pad Thai. Decent but more pretty than tasty. My friend got the pho and said it was pretty bland. Come for HH drinks, the food is not worth coming back for."
2808,"We were quickly seated on a Sunday evening. Nice and large place. Mushroom dumpling (vegan)Do not recommend. Honestly, it tasted like i steamed a frozen dumpling that I bought from the supermarket. The inside was super mushy. Large bits of carrots which made the texture of the dumping unappealing. There was definitely an unexpected peppery spice that sits in your mouth until the second part of the meal comes around. Pho boTHE NOODLES WERE OVERCOOKED! There was nothing more disappointing than having overcooked rice noodles. I've had many pho's in my lifetime. If I don't order it at a viet restaurant, my husband usually does and that's only because I love pho broths. The broth here was underwhelming. Something was missing. I passed this dish over to my husband to finish because it was really unsatisfying. I could name 20 other places that have better pho. Short rib Massaman curry Pretty good but I did find it too sweet. A kick of spice and less sugar would have been perfect. It is a large dish of curry. You can get an extra bowl of rice and share it with your partner."
2809,"This place was a surprise as we had cancelled our earlier dinner reservations.  The appetizers were incredible, especially the dumplings.  The sauce that they nestle the dumplings in had a great flavor to it. We ordered the Pad Gra Prow (with fried Pork Belly), Pho & Lobster Pad Thai.First off, if you are going to try to experience real Thai food, this is not the place for you.  Fusion-Thai is fun and Obao puts the fun directly into their dishes with a flavor journey that occupies your mouth with a war of bitter, sweet and sour leaving you wondering which one won..Washing your food down with a nice glass or red, or a Singha beer is a good palate reset for the next bite.  The decor and ambience is busy but not too overpowering.  Lighting creates a mood that takes you back to a night market dinner on the Chao Praya river on Sunday night in Bangkok.  Hells Kitchen deserves a resteraunt like this and we will definitely go back to eat here should we get that opportunity.  Well done!"
2810,"Came to this super popular place that I saw was top rated for a date. I also love Asian food, especially since my parents are Vietnamese and I traveled all over Asia and have taken cooking classes from many of the countries there.Made a reservation and was seated outside as it was pretty hot and didn't want to be cooked indoors.Got the crispy spring rolls, and they were good but I would like the non-fried option much better if it was available. Feels too much like Panda express. Not really a big soup or noodles kind of guy. If it's Pho, it needs to be made by my mum or someone's grandmum in the motherland for it to be even remotely good. Got the bruiseberry mojito, tasty but weak. Essentially a $15 juice in an over-iced glass.They have ""Michelin Recommended"" Pho Bo. This is absolutely misleading. I did some research because I thought it was interesting that the restaurant isn't Michelin starred, but their food is? The only thing I found was that the recommendations were from about a decade ago, but I also can't seem to find any ""meals"" that are recommended. To the best of my knowledge, Michelin only rates restaurants in their guide. I will give this place the benefit of the doubt. Also, I don't think Michelin would go into poor countries or local streets to compare what a really great bowl of Pho is compared to how they are made in Westernized cities. Regardless, my date ordered it and it wasn't that great. Broth was decent though.I ordered the Pad Thai. It was good for the most part, but the chicken was a bit dry and lacked any good seasoning/flavoring.My date was awful though so it kind of ruined the whole experience. Not sure if this has a direct effect on the stars though, but from my review, it feels warranted."
2811,"Recommended by a friend while i was stopping over in NYC and it was fantastic!They had a lunch special that came with a generous entree and appetizer - the service was OK but the food was excellent. I had the Spring rolls, that were lightly fried which made them extra delicious and the Pho Bo - which by adding just a lot of chili and sides, was some of the best I've ever had!"
2812,"Our overall visit was okay. We ordered a beef pad see ew, khao soi and pho bo. My boyfriend enjoyed the pho a lot and I agreed that the broth was pretty decent. That pad see ew was probably the driest and most bland pad see ew I've ever had in my life. Even the worst pad see ew I've had in Seattle is still better than this one. I couldn't get past 2 bites. The beef pieces were chewy and the rice noodles are so obviously neglected in flavor. Hard pass for this one. My khao soi was okay. The flavor was pretty good but wasn't anything out of the ordinary. I had a hard time finishing this because of how heavy it was. The duck was also a bit chewy and tough and the pickled mustard greens just a little too sour for me. Also, we looked at the appetizer menu and in what world does $10 for three eggrolls make sense? Not in mine!!!"
2813,"Great Thai/Asian fusion restaurant with solid food and a really nice interior environment/atmosphere! I came for dinner and ordered the Pad See Iew. It was a bit too salty but was very flavorful. The noodles and beef were both cooked well. The portion size was a bit small, but the $16 price was reasonable.My favorite part of Obao was actually the interior decor. Both the lower and upper dining levels are decorated with interesting fixtures hanging from the ceiling (among other tasteful decor) and the dim lighting contributes to a more intimate kind of ambiance. However, the music selection was a bit questionable- it was like club music. The atmosphere could have definitely been improved with more chill music. Also, the music volume and other diners nearby made the restaurant rather noisy.The service speed was quick and the staff members were average friendliness. I came on a Friday night and it was busy, but there were still a few open tables.Overall, Obao is a great place for a Thai/Asian fusion dinner. If they just took my few recommendations, I could see them becoming a 5 star place, but for now, I am giving Obao a solid 4 stars."
2814,This is a solid Thai restaurant.  Great drinks and great food.  The wife is a fan of any martini with lychee and the Flunk Flink did not disappoint.  Here's what we ordered:- Chicken/Shrimp dumplings - Phad See Iew: unlike other restaurants had a good portion of beef- Drunken Duck Noodles: my 13 year old loved this dish- Pho Ga
2815,"Obao has very solid Vietnamese and Thai food! The atmosphere is pretty romantic, with dimmed lights and candles, so definitely a good place to take a date... if you have one hahaha. I didn't so I went with friends instead.For some reason, when we were dining that day, the restaurant decided to play super depressing acoustic music, so it made the mood a gloomy. It was also the last day a friend who was visiting would be here, so having sad emotional music really didn't help the mood.We got to the restaurant right before happy hour ended, so we decided to split 1/2 dozen oysters, which were $1.50 each. These oysters were super juicy and sweet and came with a tangy and mildly spicy sauce that also had a unique umami flavor reminiscent to fish sauce.We also started off with a papaya salad. It was alright. I feel like the papaya strips were too thick for my taste and the sauce was not as flavorful as I would like. Finally, it was barely spicy at all :(One friend got the khao soi, which is a curry noodle soup with roast duck. I tried a bite and it was delightful! The broth was rich, coconut-y, and super flavorful. My friend's only complaint was that there weren't enough pickled vegetables!My other friend got the drunken noodles. These noodles are my friend's (and also my) go-to Thai noodles and they hit the spot for her!I got the pork and shrimp bun. This dish was plain vermicelli noodles with pickled radish+carrot slivers, lettuce, raw bean sprouts, mint, and cucumber, topped with grilled lemongrass shrimp and pork. There was also a side of sauce, which was fish sauce-based. This dish was super refreshing, perfect for a hot day. Additionally, there was a generous amount of meat! My one complaint is that there wasn't enough sauce haha.I definitely will go here if I'm in the area and hopefully they'll be playing less depressing music haha"
2816,"Stopped in this little spot as they allowed outside seating. We made the rookie mistake of traveling to nyc during the mandate without proof of vaccine and have struggled finding places with outdoor seating! This was a short walk from time square and absolutely delicious! We came during lunch so each entree came with a free app. I got the pad see iew my dad got the pad Thai my mom got the pho and for apps we got egg rolls , dumplings, and the chicken wings. We were amazed by how delicious! My dad said it was the best food he's had in a while!"
2817,"Colleague and I decided to grab some Asian food to celebrate our last day and this fusion spot looked to be perfect.  After staring at the menu for some quite some time we ordered the Vietnamese Crispy Spring Rolls, Spare Ribs with Honey Tamarind Glaze, Papaya Salad, Pad Thai, Crispy Pork Belly Kaprow, Spicy Lemongrass Kalbi, and Crab Fried Rice.  Our favorite for the group was definitely the spare ribs.  The flavor's great and it's tender, falls of the bone.  We also really liked the crispy pork kaprow.  Two of my colleagues never had something similar and they couldn't stop talking about it.  The crab fried rice is solid here with a good amount of crab meat.  For dishes I expected a bit sweetness, it had a bit too much like the papaya salad and the pad thai.  Even the kalbi was on the sweet side and would've loved a bit more heat.  We all had different drinks and the Comrade Party was my favorite.  Normally not a fan of spicy cocktails for dinner, but that chili salt rim was pretty addicting!  Reservations recommended!  Service was a bit slow and there was a mix up with our drink orders as well (the gentleman delivering the drinks didn't know which drink was which)."
2818,Wasn't a fan of the food here. It's hard to get authentic food when you go to a fusion restaurant. My friends and I ordered a few dishes and all were just okay. We tried ordering Tom yum soup and they apparently ran out. Which is weird because we came to the restaurant a few mins after they had opened. The papaya salad was so sweet. We had asked for all the dishes to be spicy and none of them were. The only thing that was good here was the Thai tea.
2819,"What a pretty restaurant, the food is good too!Recommend getting reservations--I just walked in at 5:30 on a Thursday and there were no tables available so I took a spot at the bar.Ordered the Pinot noir which paired well with the pad see iew. Both great. They have an oyster happy hour (sorry I forgot the time but I think 3-6?) and I ordered 4 oysters which were prepared with a special sauce and fried onions on top. Those were my favorite part!"
2820,"Nice seating Delicious pancakes Steak and Eggs ""OK""Delicious French toast Quick service."
2821,"Decent spot in Herald Square serving traditional breakfast / brunch.Respect that this was a tight space, but we were seated inside right next to the silverware station where the staff seemed to take joy in how loud they could throw silverware from a metal tray into a drawer. Pretty big disturbance and ultimately couldn't wait to leave.Steak and eggs were fine - steak was over-marinated and definitely not medium but eggs were perfect. Service was good. Overall unremarkable."
2822,"Cool brunchy vibe place, service was a little lackluster.Waited a while for water and to be greeted. The place was kinda packed to their defense, still not what I look for in a dining experience. Overall the food was ok, my eggs Benedict was cooked well and the had good favor. The hash browns unfortunately was not, it was burnt and tasted off. I actually think the place has potential and I'll definitely give the spot another shot next time I'm in nyc!"
2823,"Came here for an early dinner ( found using Yelp). We went for the chicken sandwich and banana bread and it was amazing . Flavorful, tangy and the fries were great too. The decor is a little odd but it works ! Def worth the trip !!"
2824,"People who work here we're so kind and thoughtful. We wanted chicken and waffles, and we got it! Such a great way to start off our trip"
2825,"Pretty decent brunch place in NY! Always heard about it and ended up going with my group of friends. Your whole party has to be present to get seated, and it gets REALLY busy during brunch/lunch time. So, you could possibly lose your spot if all your party does not come on time, with about 15 mins grace period. As they get busy, it gets pretty loud and the server could possibly forget about you.. but the food was solid even though it is a bit on the pricier side than other brunch places. I absolutely loved my brussel sprouts and shakshuka. Especially the bread that came with the shakshuka... so good! I also tried some of my friend's Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and they were very fluffy! Portion sizes were fair."
2826,"Pleasantly surprised to have found this gem.We planned to have a steak dinner at a nearby restaurant but the line was so long, so decided to come here. It was a best decision.Steak was perfectly cooked. Fries are seasoned with herbs. We ordered market plate for sides : Brussels sprouts, macaroni and cheese, broccoli and cauliflower. Everything was made perfectly.The best part was 7$ mimosa yappppp we ended up having two mimosas each and totally satisfied.This was a Good Friday night dinner"
2827,"First time at Friedmans and had a very pleasant brunch. Really busy restaurant and it should be as the food is good. Prepare to wait though. This place is like an old fashion farm house styled diner with really friendly staff and good service.The restaurant itself is a bit tight and narrow, there's two doors into the restaurant which I think is redundant. The second door opens inwards which makes it very awkward to enter and leave. There is an outdoor seating as well as the restaurant itself. Vaccination status is checked if you want to dine inside. The interior of this place is nicely decorated and the food itself is good. Ordered a bunch of items like the eggs with style, pastrami hash, chicken sausage, and chicken matzo ball soup. The food came out quickly and it was hot and fresh. The soup itself is a bit bland, not salty at all. There is salt on the table for taste at least. The egg with style is good, scrambled eggs cooked correctly and the toast was crispy. The potatoes itself didn't seem that great, it's not crispy like a hash brown or toasted. It seemed like it wanted to be mashed potatoes but not exactly mashed. Bacon is cooked to perfection, not too burnt, not too soggy, and it's thick cut. The chicken sausage is just okay, it looked better than it tasted.The service here is great, staff is friendly and always checking up on you to make sure you're good. Midway during the meal we wanted more bacon and it came very quickly out of the kitchen.Pricing for this place is good for some and expensive for a few items. For example bacon on the side is 8 dollars but it's only like 3 pieces, chicken sausage is 6 dollars for 2 pieces. The entrees are priced decent, not too over priced. Portion size is moderate, one entree isn't going to be enough to feed you for sure and you'll need to at least order two items. If you're not too hungry one entree will do.Overall, very good brunch place, great service, food is good, pricing is fair but some items I would say are a bit over priced. Cannot speak to parking as there is basically none. Would recommend an Uber, Taxi, or walking over."
2828,"It's good to know people who know places. We were meeting a local friend for brunch, and she suggested a handful of locations. Even though we could get a reservation at other places, we chose this Friedmans because of their location, the menu (especially!), their policy to try to seat you within 15 minutes, and a number of other high-star reviews from Yelp friends. My check-in was further re-enforced by several favorable check-in comments.So about the 15-minutes... it's an attempt, not a guarantee, and on busy weekends, it's a lot easier for parties of 2 to get in that quickly, and we were 3. It wasn't that awful and it was definitely worth the wait. Drink specials helped a lot too, though I do feel that my brunch special mimosa might have been slightly watered down compared to the other full-price brunch drinks at our table. The coffee was also quite good, and my cup was refilled often.I feel pretty safe saying there's no bad here. I had the pastrami hash, because that's something I've not had previously. The amount of the hash hiding under the 2 sunny-side up eggs was pleasantly surprising. I would have been equally satisfied with the French toast, having stolen the last bite of it from another plate. The rest room situation could be better. As far as I can tell, there's exactly 1 unisex bathroom, there was typically a line waiting for it, and the soap dispenser was stubborn. Keep that in mind while you're enjoying the brunch drink specials and good coffee. As this Friedman's is very close to where I typically stay when I'm spending a weekend in Manhattan, it is probably now my new go-to breakfast/brunch place."
2829,"Pretty standard breakfast food. I like that this location serves it all dayService: seemed friendly, slightly inattentiveFood: 1) nova Benny -- flavours were straight forward; however the spinach didn't quite go well with the rest of the dish2) berry french toast -- delicious no complaints thereWill have to try the lunch/dinner menu next time m"
2830,Walked in on Monday was kind of busy not too bad. Was sitted in a tight area however service was good & the food OUuuu yummy The Lemon pancakes are delicious  with a side of hash browns My bf got the French toast always yummy! Definitely visiting again!
2831,"This place was OKWe needed a place to grab a bite before catching a show at the Manhattan Center (The Counting Crows and Frank Turner). We had originally been looking for an Irish pub, but none were close enough*. Their HH sign out front got us to head in, and we settled at the bar for a quick bite. The potstickers weren't bad, and the burger was OK as well, but nothing really stood out, save the incredible wine price. I think it was 30 or 35 for the bottle, which in this part of town is pretty solid. I will say, the chicken sandwich looked pretty solid, and will be on the shortlist if I ever find myself at any of their other spots (they have quite a few in the city). Walking in, we found that the place was about half full and there were plenty of regular tables open. That said, we decided we should sit at the bar due to the lack of time before the show started. Then came the problem.... namely, that the servers seemed very very uninterested in us. We sat and sat and sat before they checked on us...and we were literally directly in front of them. I was about one second away before heading somewhere else before we finally were asked if we wanted anything at all. not great you guys. Anywho, the proximity to Penn and the fresh food make this place ok in a pinch, but the service ......and well the proximity to Penn**... make it a meh in my book. ___________*OK, no decent ones were close enough, there is an absolute abundance of crappy Irish bars around here. **MSG and Penn are an absolute disgrace and should be moved and rebuilt respectively. New York deserves better than the cesspool that this area has become. The aforementioned filth can be directly attributed to the out-of-place and out-of-date/touch structures built directly on top of one another, and we as New Yorkers should be deeply embarrassed that this was allowed to happen. Thanks for coming to my TED talk."
2832,"I've had this place saved on my list for a while, and I finally got to go! I took my sister and mom out for breakfast and we had a great time. I got the steak and eggs, and although it was juicy and perfectly cooked, the seasoning and flavor was a little bit underwhelming. Great eggs and WOW to the fries. Their herb fries are actually so so so good. Crunchy, balanced with the herb and salts. Cleaned the plate. Next time, I would probably try their pancakes. They had a lot of great options for pancakes, and actually the menu over all was pretty expansive and diverse. I feel like there was something to choose from for every pallet. My sister thoroughly enjoyed her B.E.L.T (Bacon Eggs Lettuce Tomato). She's a huge sourdough fan and loves anything with an aioli. Also with fries. She cleaned her plate. :) My mom got the Israeli Falafel. I love Israeli salad and falafel. I thought it was great (she wasn't a huge fan, but she's arguably REALLY picky). Topped it off with an oat milk iced latte with vanilla. 10/10. Thank you for a great time!"
2833,Wow!!! The whole menu is gluten free!! What an amazing surprise.  This place is now on our favorites list for ever my NYC trip. Great kids option and mimosas were delightful.
2834,Stopped in for some happy hour mimosas and bellinis-- they were yummy! They have some great appetizer options to share and i'm sure their entrees are tasty as well. The prices are pretty fair and they offer some good happy hour options!
2835,"3.5/5 stars. Ambiance / interior was great, service was superb, but the food was just .... average. Mimosa was a bit more dry than I liked, but what more can I ask for for a $7 mimosa in the city? The avocado toast on challah with smoked salmon and the nova benny was just okay. There wasn't anything crazy about it. All I can say is that the eggs were poached to perfection. But the lemon ricotta pancakes were pretty good. They were light and fluffy with the perfect amount of tartiness. The entire meal went for roughly $120... and honestly for an average tasting meal for 2... it is kind of not worth it. (There are better brunch spots in NYC)."
2836,"What a great experience! Finally, a real brunch menu that covers offerings from both breakfast and lunch. Two in our party had the Shakshuka and just raved about how good it was. I gave it a taste and it was amazing. I had the pastrami on rye, which I love, and it was just delicious.  As good as the food was, the service was even better. Such a great staff that all help each other out to give you a five star experience."
2837,We lost our minds over this food! Great service as well  try the French toast and the ricotta strawberry pancakes!
2838,"A tasty but pretty average brunch, although was very popular due to a larger lack of good food in the herald square area. We were seating immediately at 11:45am on a Saturday morning, which is always a gamble. There was a wait to sit outside, but they checked out vaccine cards for indoor seating and had the doors open and air circulating so it felt very comfortable. The food was good but semi-average brunch type food. The nova eggs Benedict came on fried latkes which were too greasy and heavy to compliment the rest of the meal. The ricotta lemon pancakes were really good, though. Fluffy and sweet. The $7 mimosas were the best part of the meal, although our first round and second round varied greatly in size. The only big annoyance was how loud it was inside, specifically from the guy clearing tables. He was literally smashing plates together into this bucket he was carrying and it was so distracting when trying to hold a conversation."
2839,Maybe *2.5/5Overpriced but admittedly decent avocado toast.  Decent not delicious though. Also not that filling
2840,"Keep in mind that I ordered take out. Maybe the experience will be different if I dine one. It was Sunday morning that's why I order takeout online. I waited a bit longer than I expected, but it's ok, it's busy. However, I ordered a latte, a chai and ""eggs with style with bacon"". When I saw the food after I got back to my hotel room, I'm super disappointed, even a bit mad to be honest. First of all, I got 2 latte instead. There's no chai. I paid $17 for a regular scramble eggs that can not be more plain (yes, the kind that you & I can make at home), a palm size hash brown and 2 half slices of toast. Oh, yes, let's not forget a small cup of fruit (3 slices of an orange, 4 slices of strawberry, 8 blueberries and a leaf of mint chopped. No bacon, that was it. I paid total of $37 for wrong coffee and a small scramble eggs, potato & toast. They wrote on the box that someone tried to call me about my bacon options. However, the only call that showed on my caller ID is ""Browns Bagels""?! How would I know that Brown Bagels is Friedman?! I thought it's scam and they didn't even leave a voicemail! Anyway, I'm very disappointed. The 2 stars are for the deco."
2841,"Very nice and trendy eatery! Close walk from MSG and Korean Town! Great food, service and many choices to choose from!"
2842,"I finally made it to Friedmans for Sunday brunch. It was pretty packed as I expected, but we were seated within 15-20 minutes. If you have more than 2 people in your party, prepare for a longer wait. I ordered GF berry french toast and chicken sausage, while my boyfriend ordered eggs with style and bottomless mimosas ($7!). I also ordered their GF banana bread to go. Overall, this is the best spot for all anyone with dietary restrictions. Service was the best we've received in the city according to my boyfriend. I do agree, as our server was very attentive/polite. Definitely coming back the next time I visit New York."
2843,"Well done nongreasy clean tasting breakfast , great ambience and service so early in the morning (no wait for tables at opening) that we went 2x in one weekend. 5*BEWARE the gratuity for large party is listed as part of items ordered and not in the subtotal/tax area!!

2844,"The food was good, average brunch menu. But i like the place and atmosphere. The service was good. There arrangment was pretty good getting everyone in even though there were tons of ppl waiting. The plating of food was good also, which is also important."
2845,"A must for anyone on a gluten free diet or with celiac!! They are really great about any allergies. Obsessed with the asian chicken salad it is so delicious--could eat it every day! The grain bowls, burgers, turkey burger and all the sides are amazing. Have to come back to try that fried chicken and waffles !"
2846,"What an absolutely perfect brunch experience. The food was excellent and the staff was so helpful and fun. There were so many delicious gluten free options, I didn't know what to get. I wish I lived close by so that I could eat here all the time. It truly hit the spot. I was able to get gluten free pancakes and gluten free latkas. I was in heaven - I hope to be able to come here again!"
2847,Love this franchise brunch place. Great coffee and food. I loved their fried chicken and their waffle. The waffle is missing the crunchy component as the fried chicken is crispy enough to balance it. The Waffle is very soft but what is interesting is that it has white cheddar that makes it savory instead of sweet like most of chicken and waffle combo. The spicy sauce has a good kick to it to balance the sweetness from the syrup as well.Very well balanced meal.Follow me on Instagram @willeatfood
2848,"We had breakfast and a dinner here. They were incredibly accommodating and knowledgeable about GF foods. I had the classic B.L.A.T on GF bread for breakfast with the fries (they have a dedicated fryer!). It was so good! We also stopped in for a late dinner another night and I got a Greek salad with salmon (I was craving something healthier) with a side of those delicious crispy fries. This a great option if you are craving the quintessential NY diner food and have a gluten allergy. They even labeled my plate, so I know they took care in the kitchen to make sure I didn't get glutened."
2849,"We liked the quick seating and service (although when we walked by there just an hour later, there appeared to be a long wait, so time your visit strategically). The hash was stupendous. Chicken sausage was bland. Berry French toast was sweet and filling."
2850,"I don't know if it's because we were so excited for this place or what. But we got here with a few other people walked through the door was told the wait for 2 would be 15 minutes and the couple behind us were told the same. No names written down no order of how we arrived just told to wait outside. We were seated ordered the $7 mimosas because why not!? Waited over 45 minutes for a ricotta lemon pancake & steak- they sent us apology bread. The pancakes could have used a little more lemon and ricotta in my opinion. The steak could have used a little more seasoning. And although the banana bread was elevated by the waiter is was really just like okay. Overall, not worth the train ride we took to eat here before heading to the airport!"
2851,"Breakfast is very important to me so I looked for something dinerish in the area and found this place. For this area, you know you are going to pay and the food is going to be good and it was. However, the reason for the 4 stars will be explained.The place is very nice and they had rolling partitions between each party. Done very well. It was busy but they kept it moving well. We were told there was a 20-30 min wait and I think we waited 15 minutes, if that. You can view the menu via QR code like a lot of places and you still get a waiter to your table who tells you the specials and takes your order. He mentioned spiked mango lemonade (has a shot of sake) so we had that and coffee. Now the coffee...regular coffee, although it is listed as Drip coffee. Nothing special about it and it costs $5... NEVER AGAIN. That is just ridiculous. I can go to Dunkin or Starbucks and get more and better. That price needs to come down to reality. On the flip side, the lemonade tasted like it had a whole mango in it! So amazing and was very good! Thay was $13 and worth it!To eat, we ordered blueberry french toast,  eggs, toast, hashbrowns, what seemed like a grilled chicken sausage (very plain). Overall, the dining experience was great and I would come back again with some tweaks to what I would not get - The COFFEE! LOL."
2852,"Incredible Food, seated quickly even during happy hour. Would recommend the pancakes and the fried chicken sandwiche"
2853,"Visited for breakfast as it was near our hotel and close to our daughter's apartment. What a nice experience. Lovely outdoor seating but we opted to go inside and eat. I have always wanted to try Shakshuka because I love all things spicy, but have never seen it offered on a menu in Florida before. What a great decision! Spicy tomato sauce with black olives , fresh herbs, a sprinkling of feta cheese with two perfectly cooked eggs nestled in the cast iron skillet! And they give you plenty of perfectly griddled bread to soak up all those delicious juices! Ashley was a great server and lovely to talk to. The place was spotless and we were not even allowed in before showing our ID and Covid vaccination status. Loved the entire experience. I'm not a sweet for breakfast gal, but the chicken and waffles that kept going by me looked fabulous as well!"
2854,The food was good! They have a lot of gluten free options that was plus because of having celiac. The service could have been a little better but all around good time.
2855,"Came on a Saturday at 9:30 AM and was seated immediately. Ordered the nova benny and the lemon ricotta pancakes. The nova benny was great - came with very crispy latkes, some spinach, and poached eggs. The dish is a little on the smaller side because it doesn't come with a side of potatoes or salad or anything - just the 2 eggs Benedict. The lemon ricotta was delicious as well. Not too sweet and not too sour, moist and fluffy. For us it was enough food to not be hungry but we were definitely not stuffed."
2856,"Ordered the granola yogurt bowl and though it was good, the yogurt was a bit fluffier than I would hope for in a yogurt bowl.  Still delicious, but definitely could have done with more granola and a container that wasn't cardboard..."
2857,Was a fan of this spot! Came by with a friend for brunch on a Saturday and we were seated within 15 minutes. They have a bunch of locations but this one is great if you have shopping to do in Herald Square or are planning to catch a afternoon train. The tuna melt was really really delicious and my friend enjoyed her Benedict. The prices definitely match the fact that this is in a busier area in Herald Square but I would definitely recommend it for a yummy brunch! Note that gluten-free options are also available which is always great!
2858,"I'm a New Yorker.  The food is quality is good but way overpriced.  $19 for eggs, hash browns and one link of sausage.  For a dish called ""Eggs with Style"" I expected better portions and presentation than what I got. At least two sausage links and more potatoes! And they left out the fruit."
2859,"Friedman's definitely lives up to its hype. We ordered the Nova Benny (Eggs Benedict with Latkes and Smoked Salmon) and a Fried Chicken Sandwich, and both were absolutely stunning. I personally loved how the Eggs Benedict was cooked--the egg was perfectly boiled and served with a rich hollandaise sauce on top. Paired with the smoked salmon and served on top of a crisp latkes and generous portion of spinach, the Nova Benny is just as good as it tastes. Likewise, the Fried Chicken Sandwich was delicious! The sandwich's light, yet flavorful sauce truly made the sandwich special. My only critique is that the fries were a little soggy, and the Chicken Sandwich was a tad small."
2860,"I lived just blocks away from this place back in 2017, and either never knew it was here or this location was after my time in Midtown. Was visiting NYC and decided to try the lemon ricotta pancakes. Super delicate and soft pancakes, with a lovely lemon scent. I expected there to be more tang from the lemon, but it was more of a perfumed aroma rather than flavor (think lemon rind). Either way the pancakes were lovely. It would be 5/5 stars if there was some sort of combo that included some salty/savory items like potatoes, fries, or eggs without me having to order a separate dish or add-ons because $35+ for just brunch food is a bit steep."
2861,I have been here a few times and not only I like the food but they're also very nice with accommodating my big stroller and my baby. I really like that the owner is so personable with her clients seems that she has something nice  going on.
2862,Beautiful atmosphere and the food is very good! The whole restaurant is beautiful and not too overly expensive. The waiters are aspiring broadway singers and wow their voices are amazing! Highly recommend! I'm 100% going back next time I visit NYC!
2863,"Delicious!! Malik who was our server was an absolute pleasure! He was professional, friendly and timely the entire time. My pastrami rueben was finger licking good. Malik recommended a tasty lavender drink that was to die for. Loved our quick getaway to NYC!!"
2864,"Friendly, swift service and great brunch options abound at this NYC favorite. Check the latest menu at: friedmansrestaurant.com/…Highly recommended: the Nova Benny. Least favorite: the Turkey Burger.The single all-gender restroom is a low point; smelly and not well tended. However, it's nice that they've taken over the bagel shop space so they can have better spacing between tables."
2865,"This place brought me back to life on this super chilly Manhattan day with their chicken matzo ball soup. Staff is excellent, Matthew is a stellar server with no pretentious vibe, down to earth, and just straightforward cordial and normal (no misery vibes here!). This is the type of hospitality that warrants a tip, not a place where you leave a tip by default. Reasonable prices, clean, music not too loud. It was just great for me. Got their French toast as well, delicious!"
2866,"Served food COLD-- French fries and BLAT-- Could barely taste avocado, bacon was so hard and thick. Server was great though I didn't tell her. Seasoned fries were so awesome- don't need ketchup. Even though it was cold sadly could have been better"
2867,The pastrami hash and the lemon ricotta pancakes are amazing. The cappuccino is strong and delicious. It's only a block away from our hotel Eventi.
2868,"The food is the definition of ""'meh"", but our server was really great.I got the Benny nova and my poached egg came out like a hard boiled egg and the food was overall cold. The server brought a new dish which still wasn't hot but had eggs that were at least edible. My partners food was also barely lukewarm.The server was so nice and handled it so well and brought me a new dish. She was also super attentive even though they were extremely busy. Definitely made the experience bearable."
2869,"10/10. I was in NYC with my girlfriend and we're usually very methodical when it comes to eating. We do thorough research before choosing a place to eat (bc of her, I actually don't care). I saw Friedman's and decided we should walk in! I love trying restaurants blindly. It was amazing, I ordered a lemon pancake and I hate lemons, and it was disgustingly good. Can't wait to visit again!"
2870,"I always find it hard to do star ratings on Yelp, and here I'm going with 5 since the current level for the restaurant is 4, and I think it deserves to move a little higher.  Some might argue that this is not great, and I probably could agree with them too.  I think the google reviews have this place higher.Wait - we came here on the weekend.  The wait was not overly long, and probably really close to the estimate they gave us when they took our name.  You need everyone there for them to seat you, and multiple parties were not all there.  That being said they told those parties to just let them know when everyone was there, so I am guessing they just moved them down on the list  after their names came up and everyone was not there.  This is old school paper/pen party wait management that worked well.  I appreciate when there's more technology involved, but honestly this works too.We sat inside, and it sounded like a typical busy breakfast/brunch place.  Nothing particularly notable either way.  There is one bathroom in the back.Service was good, fast and attentive.  We got asked about more coffee at least a few times while we were sitting and eating.We had the lemon ricotta pancakes that were devoured quickly by our kids.  French toast which while it was not filled with fresh berries like many of the photos (it had berry compote), it was still tasty (and did not really require the syrup that was provided).  The pastrami hash was equally good, as was the BELT sandwich.  Having had a lot of breakfast/brunches both on this trip and in Manhattan in general, I think that the portion size is kind of average to smaller.  Some in my group did not finish everything on their plate.  I did, and I probably could have eaten more.  I've been elsewhere that when I was done I was quite full.  The savory dishes are probably more filling (as with most places).I would definitely consider coming here, or maybe visiting one of the other locations."
2871,"I was there yesterday for brunch.  There was one waitress who was very nice and seemed happy to answer my questions.  The waiter we ended up getting was a different person and unlike tha lady, he seemed annoyed or inconvenienced.  I ordered the Nova Benny with a side of avocado and a latte.  The Benny was good but the avocado I got was not even close to being ripe. I struggle to believe that the person cutting this avocado did not notice that very obvious fact.  I didn't make a fuzz about it because the rest of the dish was good.  But my latte never came.  I tried calling the waiter but he was not even aware and he did not come to the table to check on us.  I ended up telling someone else, another 10 minutes went by with no latte, so I finally caught the attention of the waiter who got my latte after I had already finished my dish."
2872,"For an easy breezy brunch in Midtown look no further. Friedmans delivers on everything. From the fluffy French toast to the mimosas with fresh squeezed OJ, they knocked it out of the park. The eggs Benedict came on a delightfully crispy latka, I wish I could take one to go. No wait on super bowl weekend!!!"
2873,"This was just an okay brunch experience for my boyfriend and me. The food was okay and nothing amazing. It's quite a busy and popular place so we came in with high expectations, but were just merely satisfied for a quick brunch pop in."
2874,Great food! Brought the family of five with 3 kids. Everyone enjoyed! Strong coffee and fresh ingredients!
2875,"Anyplace that can impress my picky eaters are high on my list! The whole time my daughter was eating, she kept saying how great the food was. I think this location may be slightly better than the others!"
2876,"I loved this spot. It had great ratings so we decided to give it a try. We were seated in less than a minute. We even asked to switch from a table to a booth and we're immediately accommodated as we didn't order yet. We arrived around 1030 on a Sunday, so just before the massive brunch line hit outside. Uri was amazing, fast, patient (as I was very flustered playing my order lol) and friendly. The food came out within seconds of ordering our drinks. I had the cappuccino and the eggs your style. It was great and I would definitely come back!"
2877,"squeaky clean restaurant, great service, excellent eggs. thick bacon and great coffee. What's not to like?Bring your keto diet, and a fist full of fiber pills. This place is breakfast perfection."
2878,"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile. I always used to walk by and it always looked so cute! I would say it did not disappoint. I went there for brunch on a random Sunday and the portions are huge, which is great. We both had the shakshuka which was soo delicious. It was super flavorful and saucy. They gave perfectly toasted bread with the dish which was perfect to soaking up the yummy tomato sauce. We also ordered a dirty chai latte that was great. It wasn't too sweet which is difficult to find a lot of the times. Like the food portion sizes, the latte was also huge which was great! They also had oatmilk which is always an important aspect of any latte. I would will definitely be back! This place really deserves 4.5 stars. The decor was cute, kind of had a chic diner look. The outside seating wasn't quite as creative as some other places but this place definitely has a great personalilty~"
2879,"Server ignored me and never took my order or acknowledged me after 25 minutes, I tried to get his attention a few times.  Was seated by attentive host, busses served water and that was the last time anyone came by my table, the two tables on either side of me had orders taken and got their breakfast so I just left."
2880,"Came here for a friend's birthday a little while back.Amazing drinks -- I personally had the Malecon, which consists of rum, mango sorbet, lime, and hibiscus flower. Very refreshing on a hot day. I had the Calle Dao Burger served with Yucca Fries. Burger was crazy juicy. Tough to take a bite out of it considering how jam-packed it was. I do personally enjoy potato fries more, but the yucca fries did the job. I also highly recommend the Oxtail Croquetas. Everyone knows how tender oxtail can become -- well Calle Dao definitely doesn't miss with this. Also the staff were 10/10. Would come again."
2881,"Been wanting to go here ever since I passed it and saw how fun and lively the atmosphere is (on top of a really unique menu)! Finally got the chance and went with my friend. The atmosphere was very lively and loud, perhaps not the best if you want to have long conversation but it had a great energy. The wait staff was great, very attentive refilling water, etc (much needed, the food is on the saltier side!)We started with cocktails- I got the Malecon (frozen hibiscus drink) which was very good and well made and she got the MaxVer. Both cocktails were delicious but very pricey so we each stuck with just one. For food we ordered the yucca fries (free from Yelp), pig ears, and oxtail croquette. The yucca fries were very standard, nothing crazy. The oxtail was a small portion and was lacking a little something flavor wise. The pig ears were amazing- some were crispy some were chewier, the flavor was spot on and the portion size is HUGE! Highly recommend.For entrees I had to order the spiced goat neck, my roommate got the lechon over rice. The goat was very good, as long as you don't mind some fat. This is just the cut of meat but it's very well cooked and juicy. Some parts where a little on the gamier side which I don't prefer but I was able to finish the whole thing. The lechon was pretty good, just didn't blow me away. We were very satisfied, would stop back and try some of the other fan favs"
2882,"Backstory: My sister & I planned to go out for brunch - found a restaurant on eventbrite, reserved, and traveled to said restaurant. Upon arrival they tells us they don't do reservations on eventbrite, only via yelp, and that they're packed. The hostess doesn't even try to accommodate us, basically turns us away - hungry & ticked. We find two other local brunch restaurants - one being Calle Dao (which was closer to where we were). My sis was on the fence - she had her heart set on brunch, Cuban Chinese cuisine didn't fit what she had in mind. Also, by the time we reached Calle Dao they were no longer serving brunch - she was super bummed out. The hostess took notice, we explained, and she politely offered to make my sister a meal from the brunch menu to accommodate her. That generosity alone convinved us to stay. We rationalized to order off the diner menu. We started with the Mixed Greens Pear Salad and Lechon Boa Buns. Let me tell you, as someone who isn't a big fan of salad, this salad was incredible. And the bao buns - phenomenal. The pork on it was almost like pernil, sooooo good. For mains we got their Biān Pào Salmon and their Cuban Fried Rice with Shrimp. The seasoning/crust on that salmon was amazing. The rice had so many goodies - sweet plantains, pulled pork, eggs - delicious. For dessert we got their Cheesecake Flan and Matcha Tres Leches. Drinks (had to have drinks) were Revolucion - made with habanero infused tequlia, and their delicious Red Wine Sangria. My sis doesn't even like red wine, but the Sangria was so good she actually ordered one for herself! In every part of the meal the flavors were balanced so well. The ambiance in the restaurant was also great, it felt like you walked into a restaurant in Havana. The night started out pretty glum, but it ended so much better than anticipated. You've got a patron for life - my sister and I can't wait to come back to try your brunch menu!"
2883,"THE BEST CUBAN AND CHINESE CUISINE!!! Calle Dao happened to pop up on my Yelp when we were looking for a nice sit down spot for dinner. We made reservations day of for 7:15-7:30pm and the guy on the phone kindly informed us we can come at either time but the kitchen will close at 8pm. We happened to be in the area and decided to take our chances and stop in at 6:50pm to see if they had availability-- and they did!!! :) we were immediately seated by a kind gentleman, (Marvin?), and informed that we just so happened to come in during their happy hour and offered us a menu.  By 6:55pm we put our drinks and a couple appetizers in. We got our drinks within minutes. Once it hit 7pm our server comes over to us asking if we wanted another drink and if we did we would put those in while it's still happy hour and we can switch up what we want later if needed. So so kind of him! Happy Hour: -Cocteles: Mojito $8-(2) Vino: Sangria $8-Cocteles: Cuba Libre $8-Yucca Fries $8-Tostones $8Entree/Platos Fuertes: -Lechon Asado $29-Chicken and Yellow Rice $27Drinks w/o Happy Hour: -Espresso Martini $14-Margarita $12Dessert: -Matcha Tres Leches $12Phenomenal service and food! The yucca fries and tostones were delicious. I typically just dip my fries and tostones in ketchup but they had this special gochuhang ketchup and sour orange mojo which were BOMB! My lechon asado was everything!! The portions were huge and the quality of the food was off the wall. Mine came with braised and glazed pork tenderloin and the pork was perfectly cooked and just fell off for me-- I didn't need to cut it as if it was a steak. The chicken and yellow rice was such a basic dish, but it was so flavorful. The roasted chicken and saffron rice with chorizo was so tasteful. And the presentation of all our plates were absolutely stunning! Our drinks were great too-- strong pour all throughout regardless if it was happy hour. I saw these popsicle lollipops all over Yelp and was told they were a must but little did I know it was a brunch thing, but Marvin insisted to bring some over on the house. How lovely! I believe these were the mojito infused lollipops and they were delicious and you could really taste the mojito just as if it was a drink. Lastly, we ordered the matcha tres leches and this was unlike anything else we had. The five spices, whipped cream, and mango coulis was different and unique which made it more delicious. We couldn't really taste the matcha- but we were okay with that since we aren't really huge fans of matcha. This place has top notch service and top notch food-- their quality and presentation is stunning! The following day I ended up bumping into a friend from home and suggested them to go during their stay and they ended up going that same day and loved it. We couldn't stop raving about it. I can't wait to be back. Please look into opening one up on Boston, MA! :)"
2884,"The staff here are so sweet. Both locations of Calle Dao have just been a treat to go to! Our person was Jack (?) so nice and attentive. We got the bottomless drinks bc YOLO, skirt steak sandwich, calle dao burger, extra yucca fries order cause go big or go home, AND FOR DESSERT THERE WAS THIS BANGING HALF ICECREAM HALF MOJITO MAGIC CRACK DESSERT. Ugh to die for.They have the best widest selection for Bottomless drinks, we tried the Cuba Libre, guava screwdriver, mojito, margarita, caipirinha all very strong and will get you really messed up They have an indoor seating area with QR code menus, they space the tables very far apart and there's a quaint outdoor seating area as well. Also two clean private bathrooms. Great for any occasion, make a reservation and I promise you'll have a great time!"
2885,"Came here last night to meet a friend for happy hour and dinner.  It was a lovely evening to eat outside and interact with people during Covid. My friend and I both had the mojito for cocktails (we had about 3 each). We shared the oxtail croquettes, pork dumplings and the yuca fries. I had for my entree the Cuban fried rice which was yum. And my friend had the arroz con pollo, she enjoyed her dish as well. The waiters were kind and attentive and it was great to be outside enjoying cocktails in the company of a good friend. Can't wait to be back soon! Thank you Calle Dao for feeding us and getting us tipsy during Covid."
2886,Cuban Chinese fusion restaurant - very interesting concept and surprisingly well executed. The decor is very charming and artsy. It is a nice brunch spot for a group of friends even though the place isn't as spacious. We ordered the miso skirt steak with maduros and fried rice topped with fried egg - delicious combo. My dish was about $26 and the portion was pretty generous. I wish they had more options on the menu though.
2887,"I finally had the opportunity to eat at Calle Dao in Bryant Park  I made my first reservation for an early dinner on Resy. When I arrived at the restaurant the outdoor dining was setup for six parties with seats for four people.  There is a table for 1-2 people right in front of the restaurant and the remaining three tables are designed to seat up to 4 people. My friend arrived early and she loved the happy hour menu as well as raved cauliflower dish with hoisin sauce and cashew nuts. When I arrived I ordered the sangria ($8 during happy hour), which was really good.  Then I ordered the tostones ($8) which very good especially dipped in their aioli-like concoction sauce.  So we were having a good time, so we decided to order the beef and broccoli ($27) and the salmon ($31) entrees, which were amazing and generous enough that we took our respective orders to go.  Our server was awesome, knowledgeable, pleasant and  accommodating. My friend and I have noticed that the tables were sticky and after wiping it down there was dirt on the napkin (hmmm). I will definitely return to this location and other areas and take advantage of their brunch menu on weekends and happy hour menu from 4pm-7pm."
2888,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and finally made it here yesterday for brunch. We didn't have a reservation but were seated immediately. The outdoor space is covered, warm and comfortable. They offer a $25 bottomless brunch for 90 mins with the purchase of an entree- it's a good deal if you're planning to put away more than two drinks (I didn't opt for it). The drinks are $13 a piece otherwise. We got the maduro and eggs, yucca fries and the Cuban Benedict. The yuca fries and maduro & eggs with the fried rice were both super tasty and very filling. I wish the yuca fries came with the traditional dipping sauce but the red sauce they served was quite good too. I'm taking away points for the Cuban Benedict- the pulled pork tasted stale, was tough and devoid of flavor or color. It also tasted like it was reheated and all in all was very disappointing. It's an interesting concept but I wish the execution lived up to the idea."
2889,"It has been a while that I have tried a restaurant in NYC that was not in ktown (for the sake of convenience).Made a reservation for this place through Resy but just walked up and chose our table. I don't think reservations are necessary on weekdays perhaps.The outdoor seating was well equipped with a heating lamp and many tables to choose from. The tables were spread apart so there was no problem. Our waiter was lovely. Although, I do think that people should stray away from any assumptions of people wearing a mask such as, ""ladies."" I was dining with my boyfriend! As for the food, the portions of the food are quite small... for that price. I have eaten in many places in NYC that have given more while being a bit pricey. We ordered something to start, spring rolls, two brunch meals and a cappuccino.The spring rolls were soooo small... it was wild! two long spring rolls cut in half diagonally and served. My maduro & eggs-- the waiter asked how I wouldlike the eggs to be cooked, I said fried over easy. It came back with the yolk cooked all the way through. I like my eggs with rice over easy so that it can be runny over the rice. I don't know how they messed that up...The cappuccino and the other meal were nice, but nothing special.Might come back for the bottomless brunch with other friends but other than that, I'm sorry to say that this place was too pricey and low portions.How do you mess up eggsand also, when I was asked to sign for the card transaction, the tip was set to 25% and the waiter just said for me to sign. Idk, couldn't you have given me the option to choose the tip? There's a covid surcharge and a 25% default tip? I know I could've changed the percentage but the way he just asked me to sign made it a little forceful.I don't mind giving businesses my money during this hard time. But, all I ask is for a good meal. Thank you Calle Dao."
2890,"Such a cool concept, Cuban-Chinese fusion! Add to that a rustic atmosphere with open windows and partially outdoor seating and it's off to a good start!We really wanted to try the fusion dishes we couldn't find anywhere else. While the man-po maduros were arguably one of the best dishes I've ever had (totally nailed the fusion I was looking for, with pork and Sichuan peppercorns), the rest of the apps were good, but not great. The cheesecake flan was also really good and a perfect sweet way to finish the meal.On top of it, the specialty cocktail, Revolucion was totally unique and delicious if you're looking for something genuinely spicy/sweet. However, the cocktails were a touch pricy ($16/per).Overall a really good experience. Our waiter was nice and helpful and the meal was pleasant. Would recommend!"
2891,"I'm so glad this business is operating during COVID. Honestly, the best mojitos I've had in a long time. Prime location for happy hour with friends/ coworkers. The service was great and so was the food. The bartender was super friendly and I will definitely be going again. I can't wait until stuff gets back to normal. I can see this becoming my go-to happy hour after work!"
2892,"The most amazing bottomless spot in Bryant Park with the best service! From beginning to end, our group received the best service! We opted for the bottomless, and our server was fantastic at coming around to make sure our drinks were filled. You are able to switch drinks too, you can choose from 12 drink options for each round, making for many great options!The food wasn't too expensive, and the options were great. We all enjoyed our dishes. I was able to get egg whites with my avocado toast, and I always appreciate being able to have that option. We were pleasantly surprised with mojito popsicles that came with our bottomless! It was an amazing addition to our fanatic brunch experience. Will definitely be back to try more dishes and when we're feeling like bottomless!"
2893,"TLDR: skip the appetizers aside from the free yucca fries because duh, free, and go for the paella and goat neck, but only if your group can tolerate gamey-ness. Do not order dessert (unless free). I'm gonna have to give up on trying these ""fusion"" restaurants because adding ONE ingredient from another cuisine (Chinese) into this (Cuban) doesn't make it fusion! Example: seafood paella had Chinese sausage. Bam. Fusion? Uhhh nahhhh. Came on a Sunday night from 5-7pm, where it was relatively quiet - lots of empty tables. Decor is really nice, liked the ambiance, but wasn't great for food pictures (obv). Waiter sweet - offered a free dessert for a review (but ofc didn't have to show him the review) and food came at a decent pace. Sangria ($8 for happy hour): moderately strong, goodOxtail croquettes ($12 for 3): these are about the size of a strawberry. Very crispy exterior, but the oxtail tasted like unseasoned pulled pork to me. The flavors came from the sauce drizzled over the crunchy ball, so the inside was bland. Very average, wouldn't recommend for the price/portion. Definition of bite sized!Yucca fries (free with Yelp Check In): crispy outside, but the inside wasn't as soft as could be. Red sauce was reminiscent of a Korean gochujang sauce, and the other sauce was almost a liquid herby butter type of thing that was quite watered down. Not as good as other Mexican/Cuban placesSpiced Goat Neck ($31): I saw this on the menu and knew immediately that I was going to order this. I love lamb. Yet, I've never had goat. IF you don't like lamb, and you can't stand the gamey-ness, do NOT get this. My friend took one bite, said it wasn't as bad as anticipated, but still couldn't handle the aftertaste/smell. Compared to lamb, the gamey-ness is only moderately noticeable. It's there, but it's nowhere near as strong as could be! It's definitely a large portion - perfect for sharing. Be prepared for lots of fatty content - honestly, it tasted like fatty chunky pieces of braised short rib to me. Super tender and delicious, but also on the salty side. Fusion element: had bok choy. LOL. Prob the sauce too though for this oneBlack Rice Seafood Paella ($32): this was LOADED with seafood, in particular with mussels. Another wet paella, this was a generous portion (meant for sharing!) but I wasn't the biggest fan of the slightly sweeter sauce. Black rice was good, but didn't make the dish stand out or taste different. It's also really hard to mess up a paella, and this was good! But it didn't wow me. Matcha Tres Leches ($12): the stars are docked off for this alone. Barely edible to me. The ""cupcake"" was hard on the outside. The inside looked to be a very dense muffin situation, but was wet, crumbly, and had that squish squish sound as you cut in. However, it was too wet - the bottom especially was drenched in syrup and the pieces were clumped together. Each bite felt grainy and didn't taste smooth in my mouth. Extremely sweet but nonexistent matcha flavor aside from the dusting at the top."
2894,"Maybe I went in with very high expectations, but my bf and I stopped by for a quick bite and got the oxtail croquettes and then empanadas. The oxtail croquettes had good depth of flavor and tender oxtail but I thought the mangoes made the dish too sweet along with the sauce, and the shrimp empanadas were tiny and a bit dry."
2895,"Great food and excellent service!I called ahead on Friday to make a brunch reservation for 6 people the next day. The restaurant called again a few hours later to confirm the reservation, which I appreciated.We got the Cuban eggs benedict, Calle Dao burger, chorizo and garbanzo hash, grilled chicken sandwich, oxtail croquettes, and five cocktails. We all enjoyed our food; everything we ordered was flavorful. I highly recommend the Malecon cocktail, which is like a yummy mango smoothie with a slight alcoholic kick at the end. Towards the end, one of our servers brought our table a matcha tres leches cake on the house as an early birthday treat for one of us! Then, after we had paid the bill, we were surprised with mojito ice lollipops, which were a delicious and refreshing way to end the meal.Calle Dao was a welcoming and comfortable setting for my reunion with my friends, some of whom I hadn't seen since the beginning of the year due to Covid. I look forward to our next visit here!"
2896,"My friend who was yesterday's birthday celebrant wanted Cuban for our celebration so I booked it here. We were given the table by the entrance al fresco style so that was appreciated.From a price standpoint, we paid $360++ for a group of 6. Not the cheapest and that's alright but we didn't appreciate the attitude of the guys bringing our food out and serving it like we're the ones who owe them a favor by being customers.They have a $25+ deal if you order entrees, that gets you unlimited drinks for 90 minutes. Champagne is included and I tried that but it's honestly like watered down with cerveza. I had it exchanged for a bellini and it was decent. I only had 2 despite what I paid for the Unlimited deal, it was that 'enjoyable'. My friends to be fair enjoyed and maximized the various different drinks that can be switched within the timed 90 mins.As for the food, I ordered the skirt steak and not only was it not cooked medium rare as requested, it was bland, needed seasoning. The only thing that stood out was the Beef Broccoli dish with noodles. The beef was tender and delicious. They did a nice little touch in coming out with a small custard with a birthday candle for the dessert. The dessert was just okay, overpowered by a citrusy taste.Careful when paying, we almost added a separate 'suggested' gratuity when 20% was actually already added."
2897,"Calle Dao is a vibrant and eclectic place to grab a quick drink at the bar, or catch up with friends in their dining area in the back. Some things were absolute hits, and some were absolute misses. The hits were the salmon and the paella. SO FLAVORFUL! My boyfriend has eaten lots of paella, and he said it was the best by far because of the unique flavors. Also the shrimp chips that are served for a complimentary appetizer are amazing-very unique flavor as well!  The misses were the vegetarian mushroom and broccoli noodles as well as their rice and beans.There were only 2 veggie options on the menu to begin with. The tofu stir fry was very good (4/5). The mushroom and broccoli noodles...terrible, I really should have sent it back. The dish was extremely salty (and I love salt) and the mushrooms almost tasted rancid. Totally unacceptable! The vegetarian entrees need improvement. The rice and beans were disappointing as well ESPECIALLY for a Cuban restaurant! They were lacking in flavor and just didn't have the texture or authenticity of Cuban rice and beans. Everything else about this establishment was wonderful and I would have given 5 stars if it weren't for the extremely salty noodle dish and the bland rice and beans. Another thing I appreciated was the service. Despite how busy it was, there was always someone coming around to make sure everyone's water glass was filled. If you're not vegetarian, this place is a must visit!"
2898,"I visited this location with a fairly large group, and surprisingly, the service was just as good as the food.  Some of the showstoppers were the crispy pig ears, oxtail croquetas, and spiced goat neck.  (Clearly, we liked a number of the more ""adventurous"" menu items.)  I order the crispy whole fish--which was a red snapper.  It was delicious and very filling.  My husband ordered the beef a broccoli.  He didn't finish it, but I ate it the next day for lunch, and it was super flavorful--a little on the greasy side, but tasted very good. I enjoyed this place, and would definitely visit again when I'm in the city."
2899,"Came for food strictly, wasn't that good. Yucca fries dry, burger was just not the best, and the Cubano wasn't as good as the first time we had it. The pork inside was dry and cold. It's a shame because I've come here before and it was really good. They might have just been really busy today since it was halloweeen."
2900,"Came for happy hour after work with some friends and we had an awesome time! Happy hour drinks were such a good deal. Most of the drinks are only $8 and I dare you to find that kind of deal somewhere else in this area. We split a ton of appetizers and one entree. For appetizers, we got the wings, buns, and Cuban slider. The bun on the sliders was tostones so that was a nice fun twist. We also got an order of free yuca fries because I checked in on yelp. The buns were my favorite but the sandwich was popular with the other members of my group. We had multiple rounds of margarita and caipirinha. We got the salmon entree and it was SO GOOD. The sauce was spicy, the cauliflower rice was well flavored, and even the green beans were really good! Ambiance; music was at a good level. We could hear what everyone was saying without having to yell. Lighting was soft but strong enough for us to see. Dessert was the flan and the matcha tres leches. I wasn't a huge fan of the tres leches but the others liked it a lot. It wasn't very sweet and one of the three milks tasted odd to me. Or maybe it was just how it paired with the matcha. I much preferred the flan with the pineapple and passion fruit sauce. It was pretty busy, but we didn't have to wait long for our table considering it was was a Friday night at happy hour. I would absolutely come back again. Our server Justin was awesome! Super friendly and made us all laugh."
2901,"I made a reservation for 2 a few hours before. We arrived 15 minutes early and got to pick our own table! The guy at the host stand was also our server and he was very friendly and personable and asked if we had any questions about the menu. I've had Chinese Cuban before so we didn't have many questions, but I thought it was a great gesture to offer that. We ordered sangria and yucca fries (crispy, not burnt or dried out) and the fries came with a spiced ketchup and another sauce for a bit of a kick. Both were very good. The sangria was not super sweet and had the right amount of fruit too. I got the beef and broccoli bowl with noodles which was very savory! It's not super spicy so if that is your thing definitely ask for some sauce. I just used the spiced ketchup from the yucca fries. The beef was very tender and easy to break apart and the broth wasn't too salty--perfect!My mom got the salmon and rice dish and she said it was the right amount of food and the rice had a nice crunch to it. The fish wasn't salty or too dry. She was very impressed!To wrap everything up, we shared the lava cake (comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream). The portion was perfect for sharing and the chocolate was very rich and not too sweet. My mom had an espresso and said it complemented the dessert perfectly. I shared that I was here on Instagram and a friend of mine replied ""oh! I love that place!"" Clearly, I will return!"
2902,"I was lured here by the yelp pictures that made the restaurant look like a palace but I was surprised to step inside a small, charming Cuban/ Chinese joint. The food here aligns with the Cuban Chinese fusion theme. They have things like Cuban sandwich spring rolls and egg foo young. I got the chorizo hash, which was delicious! The waitress warned me that it was on the sweeter side due to the substitution of sweet potato for regular potato, but I thought it paired well with the other elements of the dish and made for a very filling and tasty brunch.The only thing I didn't like was the yucca fries. They were too doughy. However, they were free with the yelp check-in so I really can't complain. I'll definitely be back for more standout brunches!"
2903,"Happy hour is the ticket here. The cocktails are strong and legit, and at $8 are an incredible value in Midtown. I highly recommend the mojito, which is well balanced, and the Cuba Libre, which is rum with a splash of Coke and lime.The appetizers came out quick and hot. Our favorite was the wings, which were perfectly fried - crispy inside and moist inside - and came in a delicious sauce. We generally thought their sauce game was on point, while the fried options (empanadas and spring rolls) carried less flavor. The oysters also were enormous and a good value at $1.50 each.  Service was quick, friendly, and knowledgeable. The space is bright and welcoming, and while it was boisterous during peak happy hour service, we were still able to have a conversation.We did not have their full entrees, so look to other reviews for more insight into that region of the menu. The Yelp perks here - yucca fries for a check-in and dessert for a review - were the only real misses, and we left most of the tres leches cake on the plate.We'd definitely stop in again on our way into the city on the way to a show. Remember: strong cocktails. Do what you need to do to walk out under your own power."
2904,"A rather disappointing dining experience.  I came in today to catch up with a former colleague.  I arrived a little bit early, but just had a seat at the bar and was offered to peruse the menu. I looked it over as I waited, asked the bartender what were the specialties/recommendations, etc.  Hands-down he recommended the Lechon Asado (Braised and glazed Cuban pork, plum onion escabeche with fried rice) - one of their signature dishes. This matched up what I saw on a fair amount of yelp reviews, so I took note. Soon after, my colleague showed up and we were promptly seated.It was a noticeable amount of time before we were approached by the server (perhaps because we were conversing and catching up, but at least kindly ask for if we wanted a drink or something).  When eventually asked for my order, I opted for the recommended Lechon Asado (swapped out the rice and beans for broccoli, which was admittedly accommodating) while my dining partner got the Skuna Bay Salmon (with Pan-roasted and glazed with cumin barbecue over warm farro salad.)  We also ordered a couple sodas - the first and last time we were asked.The food took a tad bit longer than I would have thought...but I could have just been a bit hungry at this point (no bread served or any noshes, etc.)  Now I'll definitely admit that the Salmon dish looked delicious, but my Lechon Asada was one of the fattiest cuts of meat I've ever been served. For a generous-looking serving, I'd say about 2/5 was tissue and fat. I was left to the broccoli and the 'meatier' parts of the dish - which I just didn't think had all that much flavor. Just...disappointing.Given all the general positive noise about Calle Dao...perhaps it was just an series of unfortunate events / an off-experience? No real incentive to go back just yet..."
2905,Everything was amazing! I had the skirt steak and it was delicious! Take advantage of checking in on yelp and you get a free order of yuca fries with your order. Whats great is this place wasn't too packed and I feel like the prices were reasonable. It made me feel like I was back in Cuba! Definitely worth a visit.
2906,"Brunch here is... a mixed bag. Extremely friendly service which I value in a meal but we kept getting forgot about? It took over 15 minutes for us to be checked on once we were seated. Water took forever to get to the table. Simple requests like ice, a straw or salt and pepper had to be reminded more than once to bring out.  While the drink menu is extensive (and strong!) and probably the best mojito I had in the city... the food was extremely bland.... which us surprising and strange considering how flavorful  Cuban and Asian food is. The fusion of both cultures should be a party in the mouth and it was just... sad...I had the jackfruit bowl and once I finally got and added the salt (which i don't usually do) it was palatable.The manager was sweet and we did get the mojito pops which he humbly said weren't anything special but were very delicious.I'd love to give it another try (especially given the scarcity or weekday brunch in the city) but I'm worried about the quality of food and service tbh."
2907,"It's a very cozy Cuban Chinese place near Bryant Park. I went once for brunch, and once for lunch. Both visits were very nice. The restaurant was not too crowded, and the interior decor is really nice. It's a very good spot for lunch meetings and brunch get togethers. They offer unlimited drinks for brunch if I recall correctly, so definitely come here and get tipsy on a weekend morning. The food is decent quality, I've never had Cuban Chinese fusion before this place so for me it was very interesting. I like their sandwich the most out of all the things that I've tried so far, but everything was very flavorful. Also remember to check in on Yelp when you are there so you get a free yucca fries!"
2908,Absolutely loved this place. It's a fusion of Chinese and Cuban food. If you check in on yelp you'll get yucca fries served with gochujang (Korean red pepper) ketchup. Bottomless drinks for 90 minutes and there are quite a few choices beyond the typical Bellini and mimosas. There's a guava and caipirinha drink and these drinks are strong!!!I got the pulled pork Benedict and my friend got their avocado smash. Both were pretty good. Service was amazing starting from our server to the bartender. The place opens at 11 and there are plenty of seats but it quickly fills up.
2909,"Solid happy hour menu! The caipirinha's were strong, the snacks tasty (say yes to the yucca fries), and the vibe was great. We had no problems getting a table after work, and our server was really attentive. He also checked for last call on HH, which is always appreciated. So glad I finally got to try it out after passing by all the time!"
2910,"Came here for the boozy brunch. The service is pretty good and they replenish your drinks promptly, but the actual brunch dishes are not worth it. We got the avocado toast and eggs Benedict. The avocado toast barely had any avocado on it and the eggs Benedict had little to no hollandaise sauce on it. So if you're looking for good food, you're better off going somewhere else."
2911,"Cute atmosphere. Typical loud small restaurant where people who work in the area go to. The happy hour is good with 8 dollar drinks. The food is really over priced and I wasn't crazy about it. The empanadas were super small and only came with 3 and were spicy and didn't really taste like anything else but spicy deep friedness. The fried rice entree was 27 dollars. Which is super expensive for a bowl of salty below average fried rice. The yucca fries were okay but the ketchup tasted funky like there was alcohol in it. (We used the free yucca fry coupon on yelp! Though you need to buy an entree. )And the other dipping sauce wasn't that good either. Server was really nice though. I don't think I would come back but maybe suggest people to come here for happy hour drinks if they are looking for a place, but can get really crowded."
2912,"Calle Dao seems to be a pretty popular restaurant. My friend and I had early reservations and it filled up quickly. Our server was very friendly and attentive. We wanted the Oxtail Croquettes, but sadly they were out. We ended up trying the Beef Sliders and the Cuban Sandwich Spring Rolls. For our mains, we had the  Black Rice Seafood Paella and Lechon Asado with Fried Rice. I'm used to Dominican Chinese ""Chino Latino"" food, but this was new to me and I really enjoyed how they blended Cuban and Chinese cuisine. The portions were huge so we didn't make it to dessert. Maybe next time!"
2913,This spot is awesome. nice latin chinese fusion makes some really fun flavors. Not the best location being in SoBry (considered by some to be the grundle of manhattan) but its a hidden gem.
2914,"So glad I made a reservation here, had a last minute holiday dinner with an old friend and this place was PACKED when we arrived. We had to wade through a crowd just to get to the host station, luckily, they were just clearing our table when we arrived, so we only had to wait a minute. Unfortunately, our table was tiny - so with the silverware, water glasses, water carafe and candle, there was minimal space to eat. In fact, to get to our table, we had to squeeze by another table carefully (there was less than a foot between our table and the next) in order to ensure that we didn't knock anything off their table - and we kept having to assist our server with shifting things on the table just so our orders could be put on the table.Luckily, once we were seated, our cheerful waiter let us know that if we were interested, we still had just enough time to order off the happy hour menu. My companion opted for Sangria, but I decided to go with one of interesting cocktails off the happy hour menu. He advised that the apps were small, so the three I ordered would be fine. I was concerned that being so crowded I would never see our server again, but he regularly checked up on us and his cheerfulness never flagged as he maneuvered through the crowd to our little corner over and over again.Maxver cocktail: Gin, elderflower liqueur, white peach, shiso leaves, agave, lime - this might trend a little syrupy for others, but I really enjoyed the flavor profile of the peach with elderflower, tempered with the freshness of shisoOxtail Croquettas starter: Chili and Mango Chutney, with Saffron Aioli - 3 absolutely tiny, but delicious bitesYucca Fries starter: Sour Orange Mojo and Gochujang Ketchup - I loved the flavor profile of the mojo, and only wished it was a little thicker so that I could pile more of it onto the yucca friesCuban Sandwich Spring Rolls starter: I love mashups like these, and these did not disappoint - crisp on the outside and juicy on the insideLechon Asado entree: braised and glazed Cuban Pork, Plum OnionEscabeche with Fried Rice - what a generous portion, after the starters, I barely made a dent in this, and ended up packing the remainder for lunch AFTER giving my dining companion half of the rice to accompany his leftover chicken! The food and drinks were great, but the space was so tight that it was a little difficult to enjoy everything. I'd probably visit again just for bar snacks and drinks, but would probably avoid for a full dinner with a large group. Maybe there were larger tables in the back, but if there are, I certainly didn't venture through the crowd to check - and it would have just upset me that I made a reservation to only be sat at what feels like an  afterthought table meant for patrons waiting for real seating."
2915,"I want to gave 2 stars because of the ridiculousness of our reservation. But the waiter and the Benedict egg saved it to 4.We had a brunch reservation for 2 on Sunday, 12:30. But when we arrived a few minutes earlier, the waitress asked us whether we want the bottomless brunch, we said no and she said that we cannot be seated until 1:30. And that happened before 12:30.  We argued that my friend's train is 3:00 sharply, we made a reservation, we arrived earlier, and there were at least 4 empty tables with 2 chairs. Then she told us to wait at the bar because one table is about to finish. After a ten minutes wait, we were seated at one of the empty-2-chair table we mentioned before. So what's the point of making reservations? What's wrong with non-alcohol Sundays? All hopes for this Cuba-China style was ruined even before the brunch!But our waiter, we did not ask for his name, he was extremely nice and happy. He was a really cool person to talk with. And full of patience and love. We really love him.As for the food, we order a fired spring roll, a dao burger and a Benedict egg. The spring roll had 4 rolls, very tasty, but was a little bit small for $11. Burger was just the everywhere burger. But the egg was really good!And it was very loud on Sunday noons. Very very very loud."
2916,"Happy hour was packed on a Thursday night. They honor HH pricing at the tables, so don't sweat if you can't get a seat at the bar. My mojito was tasty. Wine pours are in pretty small glasses, so not really a good value. LOVED the Cuban sliders! I would skip the oysters. Small and sad, plus not shucked properly. Great vibe and friendly, quick service."
2917,"Been to Calle Dao twice during the pandemic (once in the summer and once recently this January). The service was fantastic both times. The staff just knows what they're doing and they do it very well. Everything in the menu looks mouthwatering and interesting. I don't remember loving the first entree I had but the fried rice was probably one of the best ones I've ever had in my life if not THE BEST. It was busy on a Thursday night. The heating was pretty good in 40 degree weather but the outdoor seating was a bit cramped which made me a little uncomfortable. Overall, I had a pleasant experience. I'd love to try the rest of their menu items and I would definitely return for the fried rice!"
2918,Came into city for a little getaway and to go shopping. Came across this Cuban Chinese restaurant and decided to give it a try. Food was absolutely delicious.
2919,"We were here on a rainy Sunday and had a la carte brunch. 3.5 stars for food 4 stars for service (never had an empty glass of water) There's some interesting choices of dishes. I didn't see ropa vieja which is my typical go to dish for Cuban restaurants so it is definitely a fusion type of restaurant. I ordered the skirt steak, supposedly with 5 spice, and it came with yucca fries (can't ever have too much of fries). Medium was cooked perfectly for me - tender, juicy, but not too red/bloody. The cilantro sauce had some kick in it and i loved it. The only thing was I didn't really taste the 5 spice so to me, it was just well cooked steak with yummy sauce. My husband got the cubano sandwich. It was a bit dry so I didn't like it much. We had stayed long past our meal was done just chatting and they were ok with it, so it's a good place to meet and hang out. For a group of 6, tip was included at 20% so don't need to do more math. Tip - yelp check-in for an order of yucca fries!"
2920,"Hungry hungry girls love yummy yummy Moroccan brunch. My friend and I were really lucky on this day and got to the restaurant at the perfect time. The hostess let us know that the wait was 2 hours unless we were open to sitting at the bar, in which case the wait time would be reduced to 0 hours and we'd be seated right away. We opted for the bar and were seated immediately. The bartender and servers were so charismatic and were great conversationalists. I started off with a pomegranate aperol spritz, which tasted like a glorified White Claw, but because it was in a wine glass it felt bougier, like we were distinguished ladies having a sip of our bevvy.As for the food, we ordered the Moroccan eggs and the Eggs Benedict. Both HIT so good, and of course, both plates of food were promptly DESTROYED. The eggs were perfectly poached, and the hummus and spicy red sauce soaked beautifully into the english muffin on my plate. The potatoes were sooooo seasoned and crispy.Eating this food literally felt like Remy from Ratatouille trying human food and hallucinating little flavor fireworks around him. If I could bathe in this red sauce, I would. Go here. Eat here. Give Cafe Mogador your money. That is all."
2921,"Dined here last August for my cousin's birthday. We reserved a table and got seated when all of our party was there. The staff were helpful and explained the dishes, specials and answered all of our questions in a friendly manner.  I really enjoyed the Bastilla I ordered for myself. It was my first time eating this food and it was pleasant. We also ordered hummus with pita and falafel. I think they skimped a little on appetizer quantities but overall the food was good."
2922,Went to have a gin cocktail and something light to eat. Ended up getting the Greek Salad (which was great) and the Marigold Road cocktail. They add some black pepper on the rim and honestly that is an very great idea. It complemented the drink so much. I actually ended up getting two! I sat outside in the back and it is very aesthetically pleasing as well. Definitely would come back again.
2923,Love this place. Cute Mediterranean restaurant in Brooklyn. The steak was cooked perfectly and the avocado was super fresh. The staff was very friendly and we were seating quickly. Didn't make reservations but we made it just in time before dinner crowd came. Would def recommend!!
2924,Food is excellent and authentic! Love the menu of savory and sweet options and awesome teas. Ambiance is quaint. Cute bar. Tables close together. Comfortable setting. Staff is very nice and welcoming. Next time have to check out the lamb shank - It looked so good!
2925,"Vibe and seating are good, and food is pretty decent. Pricing is on the higher side, but this place is super popular so expect a bit of wait"
2926,"We're from out of state and our friend who lives in the neighborhood recommended this place. We came for Sunday brunch and the wait times quoted were actually much shorter than mentioned.They have ample seating including the front patio, indoor seating and back patio. This was back in November 2021 so don't know if any seating has been removed.Food wise, I got the Benedict and was not disappointed. Hummus appetizer was also amazing. Service was good and attentive. My daughter ordered the pancakes but basically ordered maple syrup with a side of pancakes. That's how much we had to bother the server to keep bringing us out additional syrup... kids lolTheir brunch offerings all looked and sounded delicious so if we're ever in town again, will def have to stop by again. I hear it's also a nice place to grab drinks at night."
2927,"After first eating here for my birthday last spring, Cafe Mogador has quickly become one of my favorite eateries in Williamsburg.   We had lunch there the other day, and I felt it was time for a proper review.First of all, we always get the Moroccan Mint Tea; it is wonderful.    Particularly on cold, grey days.  It warms the belly and soul both!For the second time, my girlfriend got the Middle Eastern Breakfast.  Tasty as ever.   That said, this time I decided to also foray into the dinner menu.  We started with mezze with spicy carrots, babaganush and labne with zahatar.   Perfect way to start the meal.   Then I went for a main course of tagine chicken with preserved lemon and olive sauce served with couscous.   Lush flavors.The atmosphere is always hopping; I always feel much cooler here than I really am!"
2928,Pretty good brunch spot but not the best.Poached egg was probably 7 seconds overcooked!!!
2929,"I have dined with Cafe Mogador twice- once for dinner and another time for brunch (more recently). We had ordered the Moroccan Eggs, Shakshuka, and American breakfast. The quantity of food was perfect. The flavor was all there. Cafe Mogador hasn't let me down! Check out my food blog on IG @anishatheexplorer"
2930,"I don't know if this place needs more praise but happy to add to it because it was amazing! They don't take reservations but my friends and I went a little later on a weekday and only waited about 15 minutes. Cocktails were lovely, I high recommend the Rose's Elixir it was really refreshing and well balanced. The wait for the food was a bit long but totally worth it because everything was spectacular! We got the special crispy cauliflower and babaganoush to start and both were great. For dinner I got the Lamb & couscous tagine with the Casablanca sauce it was unreal, so much flavor and the lamb was cooked perfectly!"
2931,"Sunday brunch! What better way to spend a Sunday with family and blood orange mimosas. Always delicious! Hummus and falafel appetizer with pita is a must. Pancakes or Eggs Benedict? Couldn't decide so had both. So glad I did. We were celebrating my moms 87th birthday and she loves their lamb shank tagine with apricot and prune sauce. So delicious falls off the bone, cooked perfectly. Dessert was crème brûlée and lattes. Highly recommend both. They don't except reservations so might have to wait but soooo worth it! Enjoy :)"
2932,"Oddly enough this was my first time to the infamous Cafe Mogador! It is highly recommended by many New Yorkers and tourist alike. This place was busy busy busy on a Sunday afternoon. However for a table of two we only waited about 20 min. The lovely hostess told us under 30 wait and she meant it! We were seated in the back atrium like area which was lovely. We had a time limit of 1hr 30 min and that was perfect because the food came out quickly! We started with the falafel hummus and tahini mezze. Great fresh crispy falafel (the one that's green inside that's how you know fresh herbs were used!). My bf loved the fluffy pita, we ordered even more. The grill plate was hearty and tasty. Highly recommend for sharing. We also got a sea bass tangine special that was good but nothing really to rave home about. Will definitely come back to check out the brunch menu!"
2933,The worst customer service at the door. We ja a reservation waited 2 hours and they cancel our reservation without any message to our party.
2934,"Got a cortado and the chicken tagine with plum and apricot sauce. The cortado was fantasic, but the tagine was nothing to write home about. Not bad, but not really anything special. Maybe there are other items on the menu that are stronger, but this one didn't blow me away."
2935,"My boyfriend and I came here on a cold and rainy day in May and despite sitting outside without any heaters and shivering while we ate, I'm still giving this place five stars for the *amazing* food and our incredible waiter, Landon. The hostess was less than host like and seemed like she hates her job. We put our names on the list and we're told we would get a text when our table was ready. 45 minutes later (just as she quoted), I got the confusing text that the people at our table were paying and for us to respond with 1 to confirm. We headed over to the host and told her we were there and she told us it would be more of a wait. We went back out in the rain and then she called us over when our table was set. We got our temperature taken and were sat down outside. No question of whether we wanted a seat inside or outside or outside under heat lamps. Had I known this, I would have asked in the beginning when we signed up for a seat under the heat lamps. We ordered the middle eastern breakfast and the omelette along with the merguez sausage as a side. The pita is delicious and really should be added as a side. Our breakfasts were phenomenal and we ate every bit of it. We also got a pot of mint tea which was delicious. We will definitely be back, hopefully in warmer weather, because the food was that good!"
2936,"Delicious and authentic Moroccan food, but the service was sort of questionable.Came here as a group of 4 for dinner at around 7pm on a Saturday. The wait was about 45 minutes but we were able to put down our phone number so that they can text us when the table is ready. The inside was very cute and they had a greenhouse setting in the back which I really liked. We ordered some babaganoush and grilled halloumi as appetizers and all of us got the tagine for our mains. I ordered the fish tagine, my feiend who is vegetarian got the vegetable option, and the other 2 ordered the chicken tagine. You're also able to choose which sauce it comes in.The appetizers were delicious, but extremely small portions. They babaganoush came with one tiny piece of pita and the halloumi was only 3 small pieces. The tagines were amazing, very flavorful and the side of couscous was fluffy and perfect. However, they brought out the wrong food to us twice and were slightly rude when we told them that it was not the right order."
2937,Had brunch here and it was fantastic. Definitely not the typical American brunch and the Moroccan flavor is really good for typical brunch reinvention. The price is surprisingly low! Highly recommend it.
2938,"Café Mogador is excellent and in the Heart of Williamsburg.  I have been wanting to come here for ages and i finally got a chance to come with a friend. Café Mogador is Moroccan/Israeli based so the cuisine is typical sephardic Israeli and very affordably priced. The herb omelette with labneh and Israeli salad is delicious. They put a little dill and cilantro in the salad so it's definitely specific Israeli style. I also split the Greek salad with bulgarian feta with my friend. This was also good but def more feta added. I also recommend the pot of  moroccan tea. The ambiance , interior decor and artwork makes the restaurant inviting."
2939,"The best lamb chops in the city. Friendly staff, tasty cocktails and great vibe. Unfortunately, they don't take reservations but it is worth to wait"
2940,"This my favorite place in Brooklyn! The food, ambiance and service is on point! They are awesome"
2941,"Oh my God I can't rave enough about this place. I used to live close and now when I'm visiting from the West Coast it's my first craving & stop. Wonderful wine for dinner, best & freshest falafels I had in my life and I'm a big fan of the shukshukah. Great place to share a bunch of dishes & deserts"
2942,"I completely recommend this place. I got the Lamb Tagine and it was incredible. If I go, I am definitely going to get it all over again. Online it says that it is on a first come first serve. That means you should go there early to put your name on the list and then go for a walk until your table is ready."
2943,"Do not eat lunch here if you, like many of your fellow New Yorkers, have something better to do than sit and wait.  It's not simply that this place is understaffed, it's also that the service is terrible.It took 30 minutes for us to get the food we ordered with no explanation.  If you are a tourist strolling through the neighborhood that may be okay, but some of us have things to do, you know, like work from home.The food was good but there is no meal ever cooked that can make up for the heartburn given by bad service."
2944,Amazingly delicious meal here. Enjoyed all of the appetizers I had especially the labneh. The hummus plate was unnecessary because I think it just had some extra garnish. The arabix salad Was incredibly fresh and I wish there had been more. we had the lamb shank tagin with cous cous which I loved. I can't wait to go back!
2945,Get the falafels!!! So good and the hummus!! And the salad!!! I'd have it delivered to my home in Vegas if I could
2946,"I will never revisit this restaurant after today's experience. Hair on a plate of food is a bit ridiculous. I advise that management look into the culinary safety hazard that hair, whether human or animal, presents when consumed. For any consumers, proceed with caution. Thank you for ruining dinner with lamb shank accompanied by hair with unknown origins."
2947,"Recently discovered this place and will definitely be coming back! Lovely ambiance, great service and delicious food. Everything was fresh and incredibly tasty. Loved the hummus plate and vegetarian couscous. Highly recommend!"
2948,"Since traveling to Morocco last year, I was craving for their food so I came here after reading all the wonderful reviews. The food here was quite delicious but it is not authentic Morrocan food. I feel like the food is more middle eastern (more israeli) than morrocan. We ordered to share: 1) tomato ginger soup, 2) the mixed mezze (hummus, eggplant, tabouli, arabic salad) that comes with pita bread, 3) the lamb shank coucous, 4) kefta kebab, 5) walnut baklava, 6) morrocan mint tea.The tomato ginger soup was how it tasted (tomato & ginger), nothing extraodinare. The mixed mezze is a must order as it was super delicious and fresh. The lamb shank couscous was disappointing. The kefta kebab was another must order as the kebab and rice was super delicious! The walnut baklava was good and the morrocan mint tea was disappointing. The mint tea is not the same as the ones in Morrocco  (it was bland and lacked mint flavor)- I can't blame the owner because it is probably very hard to get those morrocan mints. Real morrocan mint teas are very strong in taste.Staff was friendly, service was good. Decor and environment was nice. Despite the food (comparing it to real morrocan food) not being authentic, I would still come back here as the food was pretty delicious."
2949,"Great apps, especially the beets, hummus, and salads. The skewers are strong, lamb is absolute fire. Love this place"
2950,"We came here because Pies-n-Thighs was one of the places available for Friday brunch near Domino Park. Seating is somewhat limited, but luckily for us, there weren't a lot of people here, so we found some seats for the five of us who didn't have a reservation. Ordering was social distancing friendly, as we ordered and paid first on the phone, and then when our orders were ready, we could just walk up and get our tray. I ended up ordering the chicken and waffles, which looks deceivingly small, but it was much more filling than it looked! The two waffles were soft and topped with some smooth apple cinnamon butter as well as some cinnamon apples. The fried chicken was SUPER crispy, but not super flavored. Overall, pretty cool place to check out in Brooklyn! I'm glad I ate here, although with so many restaurants in New York, I'll expand my horizons."
2951,"We ordered a to go so we could sit outside at the nearby Domino Park to enjoy the cooler climes. If you wanted to eat in they have a nice setup outside. I ordered the chicken box with white meat, biscuit, pepper jelly, and mac and cheese.Others in my group with chicken and waffles and catfish. We also ordered cookies (yum) apple pie  and lemonades. The chicken was moist I would have liked a little more seasoning and found the mac and cheese to be underwhelming otherwise the meal was fine. All the desserts were great"
2952,"So I made a huge mistake stopping here for lunch in the middle of a work day. I ordered the chicken and waffles from their super socially distant app, sat outside and waited. About 8 mins later my phone alerted me my order was ready and a staff member hollered my name. Picked up my food from the window and dived right in. Ok, so here's where I made the mistake. The apple butter topping on the waffles was the most delicious thing I had this week, the chicken was hot, fresh and well seasoned, the waffles were warm and filled my soul. I. Ate. It. All! Every last bite, two waffles and three pieces of chicken, wt lunch, on a work day. Needless to say I was nonproductive the rest of the day and instead day dreamed of a beach, hammock or a blanket under a shaded tree. Go to Pie and Thighs, you will be full and leave happy, but don't overdo it on a work day like I did, your productivity will suffer."
2953,This place will take a couple visits for me to give a complete review because there's a few things I want to try but on my first visit I went and had the buttered chicken biscuit minus the hot sauce. I got to say that the chicken sandwich here was next level. Who knew hot melted butter and freshly fried chicken cutlet work so well together? The biscuit was tender and the sandwich survived a 20 minute trip back to my job and remained hot. One of these sandwiches is enough to feed your appetite though as its quite big.I am most definitely looking forward to another visit here as their menu is offers multiple other classics. The friendly staff and clean location is also a plus.
2954,"Honestly I'm really sad I have to write this , I've been coming here quite frequently for my lunch breaks and after work , and the service ranges from exceptional to awful . Last time I came (yesterday) the faulty door slammed into the bank of my ankle and sliced it , asked for a bandaid the staff seemed confused and proceeded to just say that's just how it is (fully aware it malfunctions) , anyways as I limp out of the restaurant , I decided to give it a second chance , today I had my order literally tossed to me for pick up . I was trying to explain to her three times I was trying to order something in addition to what I ordered online because the drinks aren't offered as an option on seamless and she said at this time they don't offer drinks . Granted I come here nearly everyday at various times and never had a issue , seemed like she was extremely disinterested in servicing me or just hates her job . People like that do not belong in service !!!!! I still always as a server myself tip accordingly even with very dismissive service . I didn't even want to write a review because I've had several great experiences with other WORKERS ! In addition to the food being fun and local for the area , it's just sad that I will no longer be supporting this business , and telling others or horrible my experience was here ."
2955,We came here around 10:30am on Saturday.  Here is the protocol.  You order and pay inside.  The server calls your name through window.  The food is on a red tray.  It reminds me of the school lunch system. This restaurant has been on my bookmark list for awhile now.  I saw it mentioned on the food network.  The apple pie is worth the trip.   It was delicious.  I don't know how they make the crust so buttery and delectable.  I wish I brought a whole pie.
2956,Meh. Just can't find good southern grub in NYC. Fried chicken wasn't memorably seasoned and the meat was a bit dry. Collard greens were... very ordinary.Chicken fried steak was also very mediocre.Hush puppies were slightly undercooked and also not well seasoned.
2957,"My mom saw pies n thighs on Oprah or something lol and ever since she's been talking about it so I decided to surprise her and take her . My sister arrived first and grabbed a table (outdoor seating only ) . It was the weekend so parking was easy , parked about a half a block away .You place your order , pay and then they call your name and you receive your food from the window (I thought this was so cool ) . I ordered the Chicken Biscuit ,my mom ordered the biscuit & gravy , my sister ordered the fried chicken box, we also had Mac n cheese and fries and we all got dessert , banana cream pie , sour cherry pie and donuts . The chicken biscuit I ordered was insanely delicious , the honey butter sauce they use mixed with the hot sauce is out of this world , everyone really enjoyed the food . The donuts were kinda cakey meaning more of a cake consistency but super fresh and good .It's a no frills type of place but so worth a visit ! I'm already planning my next trip here ! Thanks mom and Oprah or Dr Phil or whenever you saw pies n thighs , thank you thank you !"
2958,"As always, knew I could count on southern food to satisfy all of my cravings! This little spot has no indoor dining- you go in to order and tables outside are first come first serve. Once your order is ready they'll call you through a small window. Service was a bit slow but otherwise the food was delicious. The chicken & waffle is such a classic: the chicken was extremely juicy and tender. The waffles were good, nothing out of the ordinary, but with the maple syrup and baked apples paired with chicken, you can't have it any better."
2959,Holy crap!!! This did NOT disappoint. This was hands down the BEST biscuit I've had in my life and the rest of the food was fantastic.
2960,"This place is fucking amazing ! For a pair of beautifulCaucasian women they sure know how to put together menu of southern food! I had the catfish sandwich with black beans . The catfish is moist and crispy. With every bite I got some of that delicious coleslaw that blended nice with the potato bread catfish sandwich. The black beans , I've never had cold black beans but it was very good. The beans were packed in this spicy vinaigrette giving flavors of Cajun, wine, and oregano ! ( beans cooked perfectly!). My fiancé had the biscuits and Gravy with sausage. In which she describes as a master piece! - me and my fiancé Both attendees of Johnson and Wales for several years and go looking for places good to eat at! This is a huge recommendation from some culinary experts to you!"
2961,"The chicken is off the charts! The butter, sauce, and flavor is the perfect combination! The chicken biscuit sandwich is a must have! The Buffalo sauce dripping all over it makes for a juicy piece of warm fried heaven. They are known for their chicken and they definitely live up to their expectations. You want good fried chicken in NYC, go here"
2962,"Amazing fried chicken and sides. Picked it up so it wasn't as crunchy as I'd like, but I imagine if I ate it there or right away, it would've been perfect!"
2963,Weirdly felt like it was lunch time in a correction facility.  They brought us to a back room that felt like a dungeon.  Odd staff who are all overweight.  I know im wrong for saying that but they didnt look clean at all.  You order your food thru your phone and felt like we had to beg for a water. Someone then comes with your plate of food screaming out your name.  Food was served with plastic knives and forks.  My waffle was so hard could barely cut thru with the cheap plastic knife provided to me. Waste of money!!
2964,"Ordering through toast from the table was a little strange but the food came very quickly. I got the chicken and waffles and while it was no true southern CHicken and Waffles, it was still tasty. The bacon was very fatty/slightly undercooked but to each their own. Finished everything and enjoyed the experience."
2965,"more like a 3.5Came here on our way to Domino Park.  It was easy to order online.  Ordered chicken biscuit and it came with generous amount of honey butter on the side and hot sauce.  The highlight was the honey butter.  The biscuit was second, it was really good, particular with the honey butter.  The chicken was quite tender and juicy but not the star."
2966,One of my favorite spots in Williamsburg. First of all the name is catchy. Second of all the pies are delicious.  Third of all we love the food here too.  Can't wait to come back to try more Pies-n-Thighs!
2967,"One of my favorite fried chicken spots ever! The chicken is incredibly tender and crispy at the same time. Ordered for pick up from their website and my order was ready in 15 minutes! Most negative reviews about this place is re: the long wait times so I would suggest ordering To go (for many reasons, thx Covid) the chicken remained crispy despite having to commute 30 mins home. Highly recommend the bucket of chicken to feed a group $40 for 16 pieces, easily fed 5 hungry people. The catfish is also amazing, flaky and flavorful chunks of fish in each bite. 10/10"
2968,"They have outdoor dinning however there are NO HEATERS.. The food is good. Ordered the chicken biscuit and fried catfish.. The chicken biscuit is good, however the chicken lacks flavor. The real star is the honey butter biscuit! The sandwich itself is really big and little messy.. The catfish is a must try!SN: Also found a piece of hair in the biscuit... yikes"
2969,"Don't let the size fool you, there's more room then meets the eye. Went here for my birthday ( about 4 years ago) and boy I wasn't disappointed. Mouth watering fried chicken and banana pies whips away all your sins. One of my go to places when I'm craving southern food in a Big Apple."
2970,I was in the area and came across this tiny shop. I realized after it has been featured on The Food Network! I just tried their banana cream pie and really enjoyed it. It was perfectly soft and light with a nice chewy crust. The banana flavor was there but not too overwhelming. I could easily eat an entire pie of this. Next time I have to try the donuts and chicken!
2971,"I'm a bit upset that I didn't enjoy this as much as Ithought I would. But there were def some factors. First let me say staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. Got that out of the way. Secondly, I'm not a fan of eating outside when it doesn't exactly feel clean. People get up.. you grab a seat.. scan the menu and then order food to your table. They call your name to grab your food..No one is really monitoring the tables so you're pretty much grabbing a dirty table and cleaning it yourself or asking the staff to clean it for you.  They do clean.. it's just not as frequent as it should be. The garbage bin is not too far so you're pretty much nearby bugs and annoying pigeons ( choose a table in the front under the shade) which makes it for an uncomfortable dinner. Between the heat, shooing birds and smacking flies.. I was just so annoyed. Now the food... the Rotisserie chicken was succulent, moist and perfectly seasoned...the biscuits.. which should have been the star... has great flavor.. but it was just a bit hard and stale...my sausage gravy was cold... I was actually disappointed. The peach cobbler took forever to come out and it kind of tasted like mush.. No depth... and I LOVE PEACH COBBLER.. my glazed donut was super duper dry .. maybe this was a bad day? I'm going to try again and I'll opt for a different table and possibly try coming for brunch rather than dinner bc this visit was not it."
2972,"Great selection of food, I had the hush puppies, pecan donut, fried chicken biscuit and watermelon juice and everything tasted fresh, flavorful and delicious! Highly recommend if you're looking for something laid back, tasty and fun!"
2973,"Been wanting to try this place forever, the chicken didn't disappoint.  Crispy juicy fried chicken, even the white meat.  I wish the waffle was crispier, it's a bit dense, but it is tasty.  I would probably just go for the chicken & sides next time.  Very friendly service."
2974,"In times like these, I'm trying my hardest to support local businesses; my heart goes out to all these bars, restaurants, etc that have had to shut their doors or dramatically reconfigure their business model because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pies-n-Thighs has been sitting in my bookmarks for ages, so when my brother discovered they are open and offering pickup during the pandemic we decided to head to Brooklyn to pick up dinner. PnT specializes in Southern food; the menu contains a number of chicken dishes as well as breakfast/brunch selections and pies. We decided to pick up a number of items: chicken pot pie, burnt edges baked beans, roasted broccoli salad, hush puppies, chicken biscuit sandwiches, a chicken box. Everything was really good - the pot pie had big chunks of chicken and was full of flavor, the fried chicken was crispy with lots of meat, and the biscuits were massive. The sides were also really tasty - the mac and cheese wasn't too heavy and the burnt edges really added something special to the beans. I also decided to get a slice of sour cherry pie for dessert which was really delicious. We were able to place an order in advance and it was ready right when we scheduled it. Overall, I was impressed with PnT - while I'm not the biggest fan of Southern cuisine, their food is delicious. Once everything is back up and running, I would definitely visit for brunch."
2975,My friend and I visited this restaurant during COVID 19 pandemic but still enjoyed ourselves despite all the restrictions.  We sat outside on the benches to feast on our food. We had to order our food from our phones and then pick it up from the takeout window.  We saw a lot of people doing take out.  The inside of the restaurant was open for restrooms thank God and they were clean.They have a nice selection of southern dishes that I absolutely love with my family being from the south. I was so undecided on which chicken dish to choose. I finally decided on the chicken sandwich (Crispy chicken cutlet on a buttermilk biscuit slathered in hot sauce and honey butter) that had rave reviews which were 100% accurate.   That chicken on that butter biscuit was amazing!  I also had the side order of spicy black eyed pea salad which was delicious!  I was very impressed with all of my food. My friend order the fried chicken box and ordered the side of mac and cheese. She enjoyed her chicken but the mac and cheese was a FLOP. I was shocked since everything else was so delicious. I didn't order any of desserts since the donuts I wanted was out of stock.  This is a spot I most definitely will return to check out some other menu items.
2976,"THE ABSOLUTE BEST!! In sad, tattered times what better place is there to raise your spirits with the absolute best in gastronomically amazing comfort food!!! I've been darkening their doorways with my often time's gluttonous & pendulous frame since they were an afterthought in a dingy bar underneath the Willy B...years later, after buckets of delicious crispy fried chicken, the best chocolate chip cookies anywhere, huge mouth-watering biscuits and PIES PIES PIES...I still keep coming...and thank them for their service during these dark days...through shutdowns and multiple waves of disease, they never closed...so go, buy, eat, enjoy, TIP, support...and just thank them, our lucky stars and all the right gods of hedonistic pleasure both new and old, that PIE'S N THIGHS is still there churning out dollops of love and THE YUMMY to all of us!!!!"
2977,"PSA--Restaurants need to stop using the pandemic, at this point, as a cover to cut costs and provide shitty service. Firstly, the rule should be if I'm scanning a QR code, you're not getting a tip. I'm not gonna stand idly by and watch our culture get lost in our phones. Here and elsewhere, come out and serve your patrons and talk to other humans face to face - we may have some questions about the menu. Next, enough with the plastic cutlery. Give us some actual plates and silverware like a respectable establishment. I couldn't even cut your cold pie with the flimsy plastic knife. The girl at the window couldn't explain to me how the pandemic made it necessary to use the plastic in the first place, and that's because there is no good reason. *Restaurant manager(s) - why don't you instead *create a job* for a dishwasher to clean reusable metal, with scalding hot water and disinfectant which no germ or virus could ever survive (pandemic or not), rather than creating more disposable plastic waste in order to really save yourselves money rather than protect public health? Genius idea. Finally, the word 'pie' is in your name and the pie was cold. So was the coffee. Do better."
2978,"I should've tried harder to make it earlier!Pies-n-Thighs is an Original.  I've always heard that I needed to visit as a result of my fried chicken addiction and I've had this place bookmarked for years.  It's just such a small place with only so many tables and the wait times always seemed too much.Well, I should've tried harder.  This is some great original fried chicken.  Crunchy exterior, juicy meat underneath, just perfect.  No it doesn't have a honey spiced crust or parmesan herb, or soy garlic or Thai chili or hot buffalo,.....  Nope this is just great original fried chicken done better than right, not a second too long in the fryer.Get the fried chicken with waffles or biscuit.  Both options are great.  Them waffles with the apple maple syrup are great and I don't even like waffles.  Get the three piece Chicken box if you're a hungry.  Those hush puppies are great too.  Just a tad weird with a healthy ladle of tarter sauce on top but great nonetheless.I'll be back sooner rather than later for sure, even if I have to eat dinner at 5:30pm."
2979,"Shared a set with a friend with two sides and it came out to be $24+. Wasn't the most mind blowing fried chicken but pretty good. Probably not a place I'd revisit, other options are just as intriguing"
2980,"Overall, a 4.5/5 but will bump to a 5 since it was a great dinner spot with good ambiance and service. The food was solid and I'd be down to come back in the future to try the ""Domokase"" or ""Sushi and Hand Roll Course"".My friend and I shared the ""Uni pasta"" which was creamy and delicious. The cheddar dashi sauce the highlight of the dish (wish it was a bit thicker) and the yuzu tobiko added a crunchy texture and ""sea sweetness"" (not sure how to describe this lmao) to the pasta. There wasn't much uni in the pasta, but the few bits in there were fresh and tasty. The black squid ink pasta was cooked perfectly (not much squid flavor) and soaked up the sauce well.While the pasta was good, my friend and I agree that the hand rolls are superior. Each hand roll is about 3 bites big, ranging from $7-9 (unless you get the expensive market place ones). I got the salmon, negi toro, and yellowtail hand rolls. My favorite is definitely the salmon because it was super fresh and incredibly flavorful. The onion mayo was the cherry on top, as it was creamy with a strong onion flavor that enhanced the hand roll. The yellowtail was also super tasty - sesame oil and chives were a nice touch. Definitely dip it in soy sauce because it'd be pretty dry otherwise. Lastly, the negi toro was probably my least favorite even though I initially thought this would be my favorite. The fatty tuna wasn't very flavorful (nor fatty) and pretty average. The garnish (scallion, daikon, and shiso) didn't do much to enhance the hand roll.Still, it was a great dinner experience. It's a bit pricy and I didn't love everything I ordered, but this is one of the very few restaurants in Manhattan that I'd be willing to go again to try more of what they have to offer."
2981,"Reviewing for the domokase.The dim and neat ambiance, paired with the animated screens on the walls give DOMODOMO a level of trendy on top of a traditional nice restaurant. There is one area in the restaurant that can accomodate a larger party -- I brought 10 for my party, but it's a nice area in the back away from the rest of the action.For the domokase, their signature prix fixe menu, comes with some small bites, and then a main sushi dish and then dessert. For the price, it's worth it for the sushi alone basically. But as a whole, the dishes were all pretty mid. There was some creativity with plating and putting red beans in boxes and all, but the food was just -- ok. The fish didn't taste all that fresh, and the flavors were either underwhelming, or very standard. The consistency was also a bit off, as things like the tuna cone didn't really come in line with a fresh sauce on a cooked sea bass. The miso soup was good though, have to give it to them for that.In terms of the sushi, it's just ok. I've had their takeout, and expected better in restaurant, but the quality is about the same. The portion size is right in the middle, with a bit more rice ratio, and the quality of fish is a step above a typical place that serves specialty rolls, but definitely below a sushi counter omakase. Perhaps it was bc we had 10 people so it was hard to prep and have it be fresh, but the sushi was definitely a disappointment for what I expected from DOMODOMO.Overall, it's a fancy place, and they will serve you well. But the sushi doesn't even to be at the level of Sugarfish, which is quite a lot cheaper than here."
2982,"I wasn't particularly wowww'd by anything but it's a solid spot for a good price. I did the sushi and hand roll course for $48 and, geez, you get a lot of food. My friend and I also did the tartare for an app, but we could've gone without. We were SO full towards the end of the course. Not pictured: salmon sashimi and some sort of salad"
2983,"4.5*Reasonable* prices for delicious/high-quality foodFOOD:-- various nigiris: fresh sushi, chose to order a la carte since I can control which pieces were served to me, reasonably priced-- 2 hand rolls: nicely presented, nothing special, average-- miso black cod: if you haven't tried it before, you must. treat this is an appetizer-- uni pasta: interesting combo, delicious, entree sufficient for 1 person-- peach lychee: wouldn't reorder, mediocre drinkATMOSPHERE: great for date nightTIPS:-- make a reservation in advance (1 wk), cancellation results in a charge-- the bar is for walk-ins (~5 spots)MENU: media-cdn.getbento.com/a…"
2984,"This restaurant is Michelin bib gourmand, which means high quality food at a reasonable price. My husband and I ordered a variety of items to try.Hot food: Uni pasta (3/5) - maybe I had set my expectations too high for this, but this was what we struggled to finish. I loved the fried seaweed on top, and the squid ink pasta was cooked perfectly; however, the uni had more fishiness than I expected. It tasted like a lower quality uni than what I had in the handroll/nigiris. Handrolls: Uni and A5 wagyu (4.5/5), spicy salmon (5/5) - Uni and A5 wagyu is probably one of the top luxurious gourmet combinations out there and rightfully so. While uni is not fatty, it melts into a sweet buttery cream in your mouth which flows into the rich wagyu. It's a treat for your taste buds, but it could be a little overwhelmingly creamy without much variety. Nigiri: all 5/5 - Spot prawn with uni, Ikejime flounder with shiso, Yellowtail w/ yuzu onion - I first had spot prawn at Sushi Kashiba in Seattle and it blew my mind. The only other time I had raw shrimp was drunken river shrimp - the sweetness of the meat in spot prawn is magnified by its bigger size compared to the river shrimp. The cool flesh complements creamy uni perfectly, and I believe there may have been a tiny amount of wasabi inside. The flounder is really fresh, and the shiso added a peppery taste which enhanced the complexity of the nigiri. Yellowtail is a more savory/meatier/chewier/complex fish, and it pairs really well with yuzu for some refreshing citrus notes. Dessert: hojicha pudding (3.5/5) - a cool, slightly sweet multilayered dessert with some surprises (crunchy hard bits)."
2985,"tldr; good service and delicious food, a bit priceyFriend and I visited with reservations for the oyster bar and ordered the domokase. The oyster bar is a bit quiet and towards the back of the restaurant; the ambiance was quite nice thereThe food is served as a course meal, in the order it's listed on the menu. My favorite item aside from the sushi/handroll was the kabayaki. The fish was so good and melted away in my mouth! The sushi and hand roll were delicious as well; my favorite pieces were the toro and uni. While the meal was great, I don't think the $97 price point is worth the other items in the course. I think it would be more worth it to order the $48 handroll/sushi course and order oyster or fish ala carte if you'd like to. Service was also good, with our orders being taken and food coming out quickly. The waiters were attentive to water/empty plates. We were also charged $5 for bottled still water even though we were alright with tap, but I think this was more of a miscommunication error. Overall, a good experience!"
2986,"Amazing meal, there's not a single item we ordered that I wouldn't order again.  Definitely need a reservation so try to look 1-2 weeks in advance.We ordered the uni pasta, rock shrimp, tuna cone, and grilled octopus to share. My favorite was the tuna cone, but my friends loved the octopus and said it was the best grilled octopus they have had in NYC. We also each ordered some hand rolls, I ordered the yellowtail and blue crab. The yellowtail was incredible and I think any of the hand rolls would have been a good choice.Will definitely be back, and for the quality the price is totally reasonable."
2987,"We came here for dinner and I thought everything we had was pretty average. We started with the tuna cone and it was good, but I didn't like how the cone was so sweet like an ice cream cone. I've had something similar at other places and I like the dish much better when the cone is more delicate and not as sweet. We then got the bacon fried rice which was interesting. Again this dish tasted pretty sweet and I didn't love the texture of the tobiko that was added to the dish. I don't think I would order this again. We also got the NY strip cooked medium rare and I think this was my favorite dish of the night. It was perfectly cooked and I loved the marinade on it. For nigiri we got the scallop, fatty tuna and king salmon. The fish all tasted very fresh and we enjoyed all of them. I think I liked the king salmon the best. Lastly, we got a spicy tuna hand roll and I didn't love this and probably wouldn't get it again."
2988,"Checked out this spot for date night: we loved sitting at the oyster bar, it's a bit quieter and less hectic than the main seating area, would highly recommend sitting there! For food, we both ordered the Domokase, which is their signature course. It has a selection of warm appetizers, sushi, and then dessert. Our favorites: the tuna cone, Kabayaki (miso sea bass, this was AMAZING, really just melted in your mouth), and the Wagyu don. Interestingly, I thought the sushi was the most disappointing. There wasn't any special garnish/personality imbued in the courses, very plain nigiri pieces that you could really get anywhere. Most notably, the rice was not warm and the fish was stringy...maybe a sign that they had been produced in bulk beforehand and left to sit before serving. The next time I come here, I'll probably only order the hot dishes."
2989,"I was super excited to try this place because I heard a lot of people really liked it. We made a reservation off resy and the host was nice enough to seat me 30 min early while I was waiting for a friend.We ordered the hand roll and sushi course for $48. I honestly thought the selection was just ok. Considering it was omakase, I would've thought there would've been more variety--like uni, scallops, or shrimp, but it was just fish. Some of the pieces were also a little fishy. My favorite was the fatty tunaI'm giving it a 4 star though for the amount you get for the price and how nice the staff were."
2990,"If I could give Domodomo 7 stars I would - it's undoubtedly my favorite restaurant in the city. Every piece of the Domodomo experience calls for more than 5 stars: the ambiance, service, food and drink.I can't count how many times I've been here and each time I leave feeling so full but light because of how fresh each menu item is. The menu changes slightly each time with new exciting additions that always hit the mark. I love everything here so I'll try my best to recap and shortlist must-try items1. Uni Pasta - there's nothing quite like this delicious uni and parmesan forward pasta dish. The squid ink tagliatelle accents the salty uni and parmesan crisps. Can't come here and skip this dish!2. Miso Black Cod - I've had several different preparations of this dish in the past. Nothing compares to this version - the flavor seeps down into the cod and each bite melts like butter. The squash purée on the side is delicious just on its own.3. The hand rolls - these hand rolls are unique to the Domodomo experience. Each one comes out quickly to be enjoyed quickly to maximize the texture and flavor of each roll. The blue crab roll is my favorite but I recommend you try several - you won't regret it.4. Cocktails and wine/beer - both excellent. They have several hard to find Japanese beers and their watermelon cooler cocktail is refreshing and fruit forward. In addition to this shortlist, you can't go wrong with anything on their menu. It's all incredibly delicious. And best of all, it's met with such a modern and clean restaurant interior. The service is incredibly quick and friendly every single time. If you love Japanese food, run don't walk to Domodomo! I promise you'll be back to try more."
2991,"The uni pasta and hand rolls were literally *chef's kiss*. The uni pasta was super flavorful and the noodles soaked up a lot of the broth. The texture was aldente and had the perfect amount of uni on it. For the hand rolls, highly recommend the scallop, negi toro, and uni + wagyu! The wagyu was not as buttery soft as I had expected but still worth while to try. Skip the blue crab though, it was just average. We also had the spot prawn + uni nigiri and that was  priced fairly given quality of it. The oysters were quite affordable and each one was from a different location so it was fun sampling all of them! Overall, this was a really relaxing and chill experience. The interior is really modern and sleek as well. Definitely consider making a reservation ahead of time too!"
2992,"Ordered sushi delivery from here on DoorDash. The order was prepared quickly and got to us earlier than anticipated. Additionally the portion sizes of the meals they offer are huge. My sister and I ordered two sets (nigiri set and roll set) and that was way too much food for us.The quality of the fish is to be expected at the price they charge which is why I took a star off. Nonetheless, if you're looking for a quick, decently priced sushi meal, I would really recommend this spot! 4/5"
2993,"This place was decent for takeout sushi and hand rolls. The food was fresh and delish. It's a bit on the pricy side though and its a bit out of the way because it's in lower Manhattan near NYu. The sushi came in a box with sauces and sides ( edamame and cabbage salad). I wish there were instructions in the box like what's inside like sauces and what sauces goes with which sushi like sugar fish. Overall, it was a solid place with decent sushi. It's a place to splurge when you want to feel a little fancy than going to your typical sushi takeout joint."
2994,"Home of the hand rolls -This is such a good sushi spot it's not even funny. it's very evident why they are Michelin star  Everything from the presentation, to the freshness of the fish , to the complementitive toppings and sauces, to the textures - were all well thought out.  My favorite must get hand rolls would be the lobster, spicy yellowtail, and shrimp tempura surprisingly but all of them were The miso  was delicious   the Kabocha squash purée was such a nice touch. Highly recommend this as a date spot (it's more intimate indoors)."
2995,"I was blown away by the quality of Domodomo. Not just the food, but also the service and the ambiance. I had the 10 course omakase. Yes, the portion sizes are small. But if you're not a big eater, then you should be leaving the restaurant satiated. I was started with a mussel appetizer that had a tangy taste. All the sauces and/or marinades are light and tangy, which is perfect for me. The gyudon bowl was next. The last few courses were sushi. The service was excellent. Our waitress was friendly without being overbearing. I believe she was keeping an eye on our table to ensure that we weren't sitting without food in front of us for too long."
2996,"DomoDomo is open for lunch and dinner and had a spacious, heated outdoor parklet. They are known for their hand rolls and for a great reason! Everything we had was incredible, but a few items that stood out are listed below:*Miso Cod - absolutely cannot miss*Uni Pasta - not too salty or too think and the pasta texture was perfect*Hand Rolls - Negi Toro, Salmon & Avocado, Eel, Yellowtail*Agedashi TofuThe cabbage salad is also an honorable mention at $4 with a super tasty peanut dressing."
2997,"Got the domokase along with some other entries. The domokase was good, it's definitely not the traditional edomae omakase, but the sushi was solid. The miso cod was definitely the star, it was sweet and tender. The wagyu was disappointing as I expected better quality at this price point and it was over cooked. It was a fun experience, but I think I would prefer a more traditional edomae omakase experience."
2998,"How do you DOMODOMO?  We do 4 trays of hand rolls that filled our table.  Loved every moment of it!Had family visiting and decided to make a ressie to enjoy this gem for a party of 8!  Have your vax card ready & then feast!  Love the atmosphere, dim and sociable.  Tables have partition and staff all wear mask and are careful when handling your food.  Restrooms are together but separate stalls for F/M.  Nice! Got a bottle a sake (I don't drink) and everyone enjoyed it very much - ""smooth & delicious"". Starters: 2 dozens of sweet PEI oysters! Share plates of hot entrees: Kimchi, bacon, garlic Fried Rice, scallop risotto, uni pasta in squid ink and the pork belly rice dish.  The risotto tasted more like jook... and the uni was barely visible in the pasta dish.  The pork belly didn't have the wow factor. Winner - the kimchi, bacon, garlic fried rice... loved the banging flavor! Hand rolls (taco style): Wagyu, unagi & foie gras, miso cod, snow crab, king crab, toro (yellow tail, spicy salmon*).  It's good... but not mind blown good... the king crab was saved by the yummy crispy sesame coasted nori.... My favs - definitely the unagi & foie and the miso cod!  Too bad they ran out of the uni one..  My picks might be different. Everything was delicious... is it high quality like a Michelin star omakase? No. But for the value, it's pretty darn good.  Our meal was over $1100... + tip, and we all left happy. Recommend hitting it up if you're around the area! #yelplife #feasting *note: they actually forgot to make those 2 hand rolls... but left it on the bill, easy fix."
2999,"I ordered the sushi and hand roll set and a hojicha pudding for delivery. The set comes with 10 pieces of nigiri, two 4-piece sushi rolls, some salmon slices, edamame, and cabbage salad with black sesame dressing on the side. The set let me choose two different types of rolls so I got the salmon avocado and the spicy yellowtail.The sushi was neatly packed in a box, which I appreciate! The rolls looked small but they were ~80% fish/filling which I appreciate since some places add more rice than filling. The salmon avocado roll was solid and the fish was fresh. The spicy yellowtail had spicy Mayo and a slice of fresh jalapeño on top. It was spicy and savory but not heavy.The set came with 10 pieces of nigiri as well. The sushi was very fresh and delicious. The nigiri is on the smaller side but I liked their rice to fish ratio. Additionally, I liked how they only added a little bit of garnish, such as shiso or scallion, to each of the nigiri so it kept the sushi interesting while still preserving the original flavors of the fish. One of the fish though was topped with something that tasted like banana, which was a strange combination. However, the banana flavor was thankfully not too powerfulI really liked the cabbage salad -- it was refreshing and the sesame dressing was sweet and savory.The set was pretty filling and I couldn't eat the pudding I got until much later haha. The pudding had a strong hojicha flavor and was very creamy. However, the syrup they had on top was a little watery for my taste and made the texture of the pudding strangely watery yet creamy. Also, sadly, the puffed rice on top of the pudding was sitting in the liquid for too long that it got soggy :( so I would recommend trying the pudding dining instead of takeout/delivery.Overall, domodomo is an excellent place to get sushi. I love that their sushi set comes with a side of veggies and I was really surprised at how filling the box was. Finally, the sushi was fresh and they didn't skimp out on the fish portions :)"
3000,"This place is a bit of a home in the wall, but once you go in it's a full size restaurant. Environment is wonderful to grab a nice meal with friends or coworkers. During lunch, they have the handrolls set special (4 rolls for $24), which is honestly a pretty good deal considering the size of these hand rolls. They were definitely larger than regular ones and we were pleasantly full by the end. We sampled basically all of them as a group, and collectively thought miso black cod was the best roll. I personally also really liked the unagi with chocolate sauce. The crab roll was fresh, but crab is not as strong of a flavor in general, so not much to say about that. My friend really liked the spicy tuna with crunch and spicy salmon. All in all, great spot and would come to try their hot dishes or domokase experience"
3001,"Very creative menu, especially for omakase. Portions were massive. I was honestly impressed with the creativity from every single dish we ordered. However, the quality of the food lacked and I feel like some of the items had way too much going on.  Need some work."
3002,"Great seating outdoors.   The staff were nice but we had some communication issues with our waiter.  We didn't quite understand each other.  Not a big deal, but our friends wound up getting a bottle of sake instead of a couple of glasses.   Westarted off with the amazing mushroom- which is up there in the mushroom pantheon. It's breaded and dried, served in a pool of aioli.  It's rich and meaty. We had the cabbage salad, which is like sesame noodles over cabbage.   The assorted hand rolls were delicious and beautifully presented. The tuna cones were cute and well received.   I had a bite of my friend's octopus.  It was good, but a little bit al dente compared with what we are used to.  I liked it, my friend liked it less.   Nice restaurant with excellent food that is a cut above most other Japanese restaurants."
3003,"We came here on a weekday evening with a reservation a few weeks ago when the weather was still warm, and we had outdoor seating. This restaurant is located on the border of Greenwich Village and Soho and is fairly easy to find.We ordered Domokase, aka Domodomo's signature course. The food and service are both great. The first course includes seasonal oyster, tuna cone, and usuzukuri. They are mouthwatering. It's my favorite course. The second course is Kabayaki (miso Chilean sea bass, kabocha purée, tomato). The sea bass is tender and tasty. The third course is Donburi (wagyu don, daikon soup, seasonal pickles). It tastes good though I'm not a big fan of don and pickles. The fourth course is chef's choice premium sushi which is another highlight of the meal. They are fresh and delicious. The fifth course is hand rolls. You can choose from the list, and there are more than ten options to choose from. We ordered spicy salmon and spicy tuna. The sixth and last course is dessert. There are four dessert options. We chose black sesame panna cotta and hojicha pudding. Both desserts are yummy. I like Japanese desserts as they are not too sweet. I was very full after the meal and definitely satisfied. Domokase costs $97 per person and I think it's totally worth it given the great quality and taste. I'd highly recommend it."
3004,"Did the 'Domokase' (Omakase) menu, which was $100pp. It's pretty good value for the price, but I wasn't wowed by the meal. The presentation was beautiful and the food was delicious, however I felt the 'Omakase experience' was lacking. They do rush you a bit through the courses. You also have regular dining (not in front of a chef preparing each dish), so a waiter brings each course to you. I'd recommend the Omakase as a starter / entry into Omakase to see if it's something you'd like. Will definitely be back to try their a la carte items (which might be the way to go)."
3005,"Great lunch special for quality and fresh sushi. $24 for 4 hand rolls which are pretty sizable and are filled to the brim!Ordered the spicy salmon, spicy yellowtail, toro, and salmon avocado. Each had a unique flavor but with very simple ingredients to allow the fish to be the star each time. Will definitely be back to try the tasting menu."
3006,"Previous and current stars for sushi only. This is not to say I haven't eaten other meals but that this spot is only worth visiting for their delicate perfection: raw fish. Although my stomach was on the brink of exploding today, because I was so full, I could not stop myself from eating my sushi/hand roll course.I've eaten the fried rices, dashi tofu, miso cod and octopus all were quite lackluster. So overall if you're in the mood for fresh and tender sashimi Domo Domo is the spot."
3007,"Decided to give this place another try, because I felt they may have been struggling and short staffed from the COVID-19 pandemic the first time I went. I'm very glad I went back and gave a second chance, because it's absolutely delicious! The service was really great, the fish was fresh and the rice did not seem like it had been sitting out like it did the first time I came. I definitely recommend the Brussels sprouts and the cucumber salad. They both have a bright yuzu flavor. As far as nigiri/hand rolls, I really enjoyed the spicy salmon hand roll that had just the right amount of kick and the branzino nigiri with pesto."
3008,"This is an excellent Japanese dining experience on Houston Street. Even if you make the mistake of booking outdoor seating in these unforgiving winter months, the warmth of the space heaters will not let you down. The food, the drinks, and the service are beyond spectacular at Domodomo. The waiters care, they want you to enjoy your time here. Feel free to ask them about any recommendations they might have to offer if you're not sure what to order or for brief descriptions of any items you might have questions regarding.Let's start off with some drinks; their beer selection is good, sake selection is great, and their cocktails are excellent. For beer, try the Kagua Blanc if it's available, but keep in mind that they also have Sapporo on tap. Ask the waiter to recommend you a sake based on your taste preferences if that's what you're in the mood for. Their cocktails may skew a bit sweet, but you can ask them to tone it down a bit if you prefer something drier. The Watermelon Cooler, Honey Plum, and Peach Lychee are all excellent choices, but don't stop there if you see something else you'd like to try.Once you've ordered a drink to keep you company, we can move onto hand rolls. You're presented with about 15 choices but will likely order only 2 or 3 - what will you get? The Spicy Salmon and Spicy Yellowtail are reliable, the Unagi is decadent, the Spicy Tuna with Crunch is a new favorite, and the Blue Crab and Miso Black Cod make for a sumptuous treat. As with drinks, you can't go wrong with any of their hand rolls - try something new and give the nigiri sushi a shot as well if you're up for it!Proceeding to the mains, the Grilled Octopus is great; the octopus pairs wonderfully with the mushrooms in the plate. If you don't get a chance to try the Kabayaki (Chilean sea bass) on the Domokase menu, then definitely order the Miso Black Cod - I try this dish at every Japanese restaurant I visit and this is definitely one of the best renditions. I really enjoy the pairing of the Kabocha (winter squash) puree and black cod in Chef Kim's version at Domodomo. Apart from that, the Shrimp Dumpling is consistently excellent, the Tobiko Pasta is a nice addition to the menu, and the Uni Pasta is simply iconic. You cannot leave this establishment without having ordered the Uni Pasta - I get it every time I've been here and will continue to do so until either I or this restaurant cease to exist. The Korean Fried Chicken is great - split it with a friend! I personally favor the Spicy Smoked Pork Belly over the Garlic Bacon Fried Rice with Onsen Egg, but try both! Maitake Mushroom is hands down one of the best mushroom dishes I've tried in the past year, it is incredible and deserves its own spotlight. Also, try the Salmon Tartare - it is another standout menu item and needs to be mentioned.Don't skip on dessert and make sure you order the Black Sesame Panna Cotta. It's incredible in its flavor and also surprisingly light - your taste buds will thank you.Take liberties and try different items on their menu, I've always enjoyed every item that I've ordered here. Even after consuming all of that, somehow you will not feel heavy or bogged down by the food you just ate - take a short walk to Morgenstern's for a quick bite of ice cream or head over to Dante's for some drinks!"
3009,"Domodomo is worth the hype! I think the sushi is fairly priced for what you're getting. I felt like the appetizers were overpriced.I made outdoor reservations for 6pm on a Saturday. For group more than 4 people, you need to email them to make the reservation. Then someone will call you to confirm! We came to the restaurant 30 mins early and they were nice enough to seat us before everyone arrived. Everyone in my group got the sushi set which comes with a salad, salmon sashimi, 2 hand rolls, and 9 pc nigiri. We also got some oysters! I felt like this was the best valued choice on the menu and it didn't disappoint. The only warning id have is beware of the wasabi they add to the nigiri. Every piece of nigiri with wasabi was INTENSE. Like punches you in the face straight to the dome for a solid 3-5 seconds intense! So if you can't handle wasabi, be warned / ask for none. Otherwise, amazing meal and I would return for the omakase when I have a bigger appetite :-)"
3010,"This was a last minute decision place we decided on for brunch and it was such a great choice. We sat outside as my friend felt more comfortable with it. There is indoor dining if you choose. Ordered peach lychee and the watermelon cooler for our drinks. The peach lychee was strong! It's a thick slushi, perfect for hot days. Watermelon cooler is a lighter option and very tasty as my friend says. We each ordered 5 hand rolls each. I ordered the salmon, spicy yellowtail, negi toro, spicy tuna and scallop. I think my favorites were the spicy yellowtail, negi toro and spicy tuna but then again, I love anything spicy. The spicy sauce is the same on the yellowtail and tuna FYI. We were at the tail end of the lunch service so we didn't get to try the dessert but I'm definitely coming back here to try other items on the menu along with dessert!"
3011,"I was really excited to try this place out when I was in New York, as I wanted to see if sushi/handrolls were better in NY or CA. Sad to say it didn't really meet my expectations (probably because i set a really high bar for this place lol). We came here to try their handrolls as they had some pretty interesting options, but everything was just okay, nothing memorable. This isn't like the usual handroll bars where they make each individual roll for you and you eat it fresh, which has its downside as the seaweed becomes a little bit more soggy. I got the spicy tuna, miso cod, spicy salmon, and lobster handrolls. Everything was really fresh, the miso cod being my favorite as it was  flavored it wonderfully.  Also got their watermelon cooler cocktail which was pretty decent if you don't like tasting alcohol in your drink (like me).Overall, this was a nice restaurant to dine at and a fun place to hang out with your friends for a drink and a nice meal! They have a lot of good options on their menu and if I'd live in NY, I would happily give this place another try."
3012,"DOMODOMO has had my back for every. single. occasion from an awkward first date to an eventful birthday celebration to a more formal dinner with my family friends. I've been here 5-6 times and the food has never disappoint me. I love love love the Miso Black Cod and the Uni Pasta. If you're feeling a little fancier, why not try the sushi course? It is definitely worth the price."
3013,"I had sushi cravings at 5 PM on a Friday and came across DomoDomo while perusing Yelp. Resy said there weren't any available reservations but I took my chances and called. Someone answered promptly and turns out they had outdoor seating availabilities for party of 2 at 7:15 or 8 the same night! I find it so rare to be able to squeeze in a reservation hours before (after all this is New York), but once I arrived I realize how generous their outdoor seating space is which is why they're able to accommodate guests. Just based on my estimate it seems like they can seat the same amount, if not more, people outside as they can inside. We arrived at 6:30 for our 7:15 reservation and were seated immediately - that's what I call service. Our service was spot-on throughout the night. We ordered:-Sushi & Hand roll Course ($48) with our 2 hand roll choices being 2 toro scallion rolls-Uni pasta ($24)-Snow crab with crunch seaweed hand roll ($9)-Watermelon Cooler cocktail ($15)-Peach Lychee ($13)Portions are generous, all raw fish is very fresh. I tend to lean away from uni because of its slimy texture but mixed with the squid ink pasta and the cheddar dashi sauce, it was rich and delicious. For those of you who don't know, Michelin Bib Gourmand Awardees are restaurants that have good quality and value, where you can get two courses and a drink for less than $40. DomoDomo has won that award for 4 years in a row so you're definitely in good hands~"
3014,"The flavors of this place were amazing, the sushi was normal good sushi but over priced for just nigiri. The gem here is everything that is not sushi, basically everything that came with the omasake was better than the sushi. I'd come back to try other stuff but it is a little pricey, 11 dollars for two piece of nigiri"
3015,"Excellent experience at DOMODOMO recommended by another friend. Didn't see the availability on Resy but I called in and they were able to accommodate a table for 3 of us at the time we wanted.There's a huge menu but we came for the Omakase, which came in 8 courses starting with seasonal oyster, personally I don't eat raw oyster so I asked for exchange, they told me that they would exchange to cucumber salad which was very disappointed, that was not an even exchange. After a little bit of the negotiation they offered me give me an extra third course of flounder. I would recommend the business owner to come up with some alternatives for people who has some dietary restrictions, that cucumber salad offer is a slap on the face! This is $95 per person meal. The rest of the food are amazing, sushi pieces are all very fresh. Tuna cone is to die for. Love the sea bass with pumpkin purée combination. OMG and the dessert black sesame penna cotta is sooo good. Everyone is very full after the meal, if you don't have big appetite I would recommend to do the hand roll & sushi course."
3016,"We give the food 4.5 stars, the staff 3.5, the ambience 3 and the lack of a full bar 2. The food was very good. Overall it's 3.5 stars."
3017,"Came for dinner with friends here, service was lackluster, they served no wines or liquors only saki, which was not indicated on the menu or website. It was quite packed for a weekend, but I guess that's basically because of the neighborhood. Sushi and oysters were fresh, but not mind blowing. Art pieces on the walls were intriguing, bathrooms were clean but small and cramped."
3018,"I was in the area and was craving sushi, so I ordered take-out from Domodomo! It was my first time ordering from here and I'm so glad I did! I ordered: +Handroll Set ($27-Pictured) I chose Fatty Tuna, Spicy Tuna with Crunch, Spicy Yellowtail, and Shrimp Tempura cutrolls.+Sushi and Handroll Set ($35-Not Pictured) This came with 8 pieces of assorted sushi and 2 choices of cutrolls; my boyfriend chose Fatty Tuna and Spicy Yellowtail cutrolls. Each came with cabbage salad and edamame. We both enjoyed our meals. Everything was fresh, nicely packaged, and the quality was excellent. Portions were generous as well. I'll have to eat in the restaurant next time and definitely try their uni pasta!"
3019,"I was disappointed. My friend went for domokase but I wanted to try uni pasta and particular hand rolls which are not part of domokase so I ordered the followings:1. Uni pasta: very interesting -4/52. Scallop hand roll- how is this recommended highly? How can anyone destroy scallop this much? -0/53. Miso black cod hand roll- this was good but again not as groundbreaking as reviews suggest -3/5Nigiri -1/5:  I got bunch of nigiris and while fish was fresh it wasn't special at all. The main problem was sushi rice tho, it was even worse than grocery sushi and I am not kidding. That diminished the entire nigiri experience.Additionally one nigri that I got was king salmon with truffle salt, if you have low salt tolerance Like me avoid that. Again I don't understand how any chef can destroy beautiful piece of fish like that! You want to elevate something and not to destroy it. The worse part of the experience was ""ice cleaning"" at the oyster bar while we were still eating! the guy who were working at the oyster bar decided to clean the ice while our party and 2 other couples were sitting in front of the ice. He was violently smashing the ice to break it and created an ice storm (NYC winter is more than enough and I don't need to tolerate an ice storm in the restaurant!) Chunks of ice hit my friend's hand and some chunks hit the other couple's bag. This was ridiculous! They should wait till after closing to clean the ice specially when ppl are still eating in front of the bar/ice! Although the uni pasta was kinda special, the overall experience was not. If you really want to go there maybe only get the uni pasta and miso black cod hand roll (but I can't recommend the place overall)"
3020,Great spot in the east village.  They accepted reservations so I stopped in on my last visit in the city.  Loved the buns...tried them all.  Great place for small plates.
3021,"This place was delicious.The ramen was great, the buns were insanely well seared, and the alcoholic drinks were got was delicious.We had a mango smoothie with rum which went perfectly with everything.The wall mounted train station switchboard was so cool and definitely made the place special."
3022,"If you've never had good Asian noodles/Ramen, you might think this was good. If you have had good Asian noodles/Ramen then you know this is bad.Basically this is an Asian place for white people who haven't developed their flavor palate yet (or any race of people who haven't developed their flavor palate yet).But don't get me wrong, as an Asian person, I like Asian places for white people like Panda Express, but Momofuku was bland.  So it was like going to an Asian place for white people but it felt like it was made by a white person who didn't know how to season food yet but it was actually made by a world renowned Asian who should know how to cook Asian food, so it was a bit perplexing."
3023,"Momofuku noodle bar might be difficult to get a reservation but once inside, the service is top notch. If you like, you could be in and out of the restaurant in an hour with a great meal. Starting with the appetizers, I got the pork buns and fried chicken nuggets. Big note, DONT FORGET TO ORDER THE CHICKEN NUGGETS! They might look like simple McNuggets but they really were a highlight of the meal. The pork buns were great as well but were really similar to the pork in the ramen bowl. Better off ordering one or the other. We ordered multiple ramens and I'd stick with the smoked pork as a top choice. They were all very good though so you can't really go wrong. Lastly, I would not skip out on the desert here. We ordered one pie for every two people and were upset with our decision. Definitely a keep it to yourself kind of desert."
3024,"Amazing ramen!! We got the extra spicy ramen, with a warning from the waiter on spice level (lol) - it was the perfect leave of heat and absolutely delicious. We also got the wings which were meh, and the pork belly buns which are a MUST. To finish, we split the buttermilk soft serve which was incredible and had very unique flavors. wouldn't get the wings again but everything else was superb. With covid, you can make reservations but even then, you will probably be eating very early or very late, so I'd plan in advance!"
3025,"Located on Manhattan's lower east side is Momofuku Noodle Bar. It's a chic Michelin Star restaurant known for its food and authentic decor. Service is fast, food is even better. Recommend the chicken nuggets, sweet pork ramen, and Soju Slushie. Must try in NYC."
3026,"***Pre-COVID*** Came with a friend who wanted to try the infamous noodles from the kitchen of renowned David Chang. Luckily, we were able to walk in and immediately grab a seat at the counter. The ambiance was chatty, chill. We weren't overly hounded by our server, nor were we asked to leave as soon as we finished eating which was nice. We got the seared shrimp buns to share, he one of the noodle soup specials on the wall at the time (pork belly something or the other), myself the smoked pork ramen. The buns were just alright. Smoked pork ramen... how do I put it? The components of the bowl were all delightful, however combined as a whole package something just didn't quite work. Maybe the temperature was off? The soup was somewhere between lukewarm and hot. Overall, pretty expensive for a bowl of noods, and in the neighborhood there's definitely better options for a few dollars cheaper as well."
3027,Wow the food here is incredible!!! The flavors and the portion sizes are perfect. You can order the appetizers to share
3028,We split the pork buns between 2 ppl and each had our own ramen. Really liked sitting at the bar and watching the kitchen and our server was very friendly. The pork buns were good but a bit fatty for my taste. Chicken Ramen was really good! I felt like the broth was really tasty but not too greasy or fatty which sometimes it can be.
3029,I finally got around to posting this review. I went before the pandemic but it was a good experience. The food must have been delicious since I gave it five stars. It was not really memorable though. I do remember waiting about half an hour to be seated or maybe it just felt that way...I would definitely return to refresh my memory one day.
3030,The food was so good and the service was good as well the music was good as well oh I forgot there fries are good too I got the chicken Avocado salad I cleaned my plate that has never happened at any restaurant I went to and also there menu's consist of healthy foods and unhealthy food so you have a choice on what you like but over all the food is good no matter what's you're choice
3031,"I've dined here a multitude of times with friends and it's always delicious. Normally there is a decent bit of a line on the weekends, so be prepared for that. You can be added to a waitlist and walk around the area until your table is ready, so that is very convenient. The food is good cafe-style food and always consistent. I can't say I've ever had anything bad. Things I've had and recommend are:- Avo Toast (make sure to add an egg): this is good, but pretty standard avo toast, but she's trusty!- Egg sandwich: I'm a SUCKER for a delicious egg sandwich and this is a great choice. I love the combo of the fresh tomatoes and hash browns, slap on the egg and you're pretty dang close to breakfast perfection. - Sweet Corn Fritters: this is something I randomly tried once and fell in love. I've never had anything quite like this. It's like a corn pancake. It's both sweet and savory. When combined with fresh bites of the greens and avo, it's absolutely phenomenal. I crave this dish!- Shrimp pasta: This pasta is delicious and creamy with a soft bite of spicy with the crushed red pepper. I normally get this dish and the next one I'm about to mention and split it with a friend. - Bronte Burger: Yes, she's the star of the show. I can't say enough good things about this sandwich. It hits that perfect savory/sweet/slightly spicy combo that (IMO) is heavenly. The burger itself is moist and tender and is encased in an awesome slice of (ciabatta? I'm bad with breads... it's not a bun though!) Highly recommend this burger. Make sure to also try their coffee. I'm a huge fan of Australian coffee and theirs/Dudley's is awesome. For funsies I've also had the young coconut when I was hungover and it really did the trick! I also have enjoyed their lemonades. Phew, now that I've basically shown you the menu I'll briefly touch on the service/space. The vibe here is very chill- cute laid back cafe style. Like, wear your cute strolling' NYC streets outfit here. In the summer, they open the windows and it's a really delightful dinning experience. They do have two sections of the restaurant and street outdoor dining but I would still say this is a more intimate space. I'd limit to groups of 4 or lower. Service is great, I've never had any issues and when I'm stuck between two menu items they've always helped me decide. Overall, a fantastic restaurant in this neighborhood and if you can stag a spot you should definitely try it!4.8/5"
3032,"Came for lunch with a friend this past Friday and was able to get a table for two within about 20 minutes. You can leave your name with the host and they'll text you when your table is ready. Just a note that you have five minutes to return or they'll offer up your table.  I didn't realize that so we lost our first table, but the hostess gave us the next available one which was kind of her. My friend and I each ordered a salad and we got the truffle fries to split. I got the shrimp avocado and she got the kale. Both were really yummy and fresh but neither was huge, so probably not the thing to order if you're coming hungry (as we were -_-). The fries were also excellent--crispy and crunchy and salty. I wish the truffle was a part of the fry and not the aioli since I'm lactose intolerant, but can't win 'em all I guess. Also, if this matters to you, the space is pretty aesthetic."
3033,This place is Amazing the food is Amazing everything is so fresh love a Shrimp pasta So much and good service toothe ambient is very nice warmly romantic chic cafe good for date night or friend nightthe point is the price is too good to be true !!!Best Cafe in Soho i think . Got a new spot now can't wait to go back love love
3034,Delicious food. Extremely long wait time. We waited for 1 and half hours. Definitely would recommend if you are in the area and don't mind the wait.
3035,This place is definitely well known for brunch in nyc and it didn't disappoint! I came here for brunch and got the shrimp pasta and my friend got the crispy rice bowl. The shrimp pasta was really good and had a little kick to it which paired well with the cream sauce. Definitely want to try the other dishes especially the more breakfast items!
3036,A popular cafe for a reason! We came on a Monday morning and this place was already full of people. The interior is small but cozy. Shrimp spaghetti: super flavorful and creamy with huge prawns!Breakfast bowl: light and healthy take on breakfast with a delicious piece of toast. I loved the cheese and avocado with sprouts and it's super well balanced with the prosciutto. Sweet potato fries: I didn't expect to love these fries so much but they're so good... probably the highlight of the meal. They have sweet chili sauce and sour cream and it's such a great combination!This is a cute cafe with great food and I'm always happy to have a meal here whether it's brunch or dinner!
3037,"I came in for the first time a couple months ago and waited about 15 mins to get in. It was very small and there were two different buildings that had sitdown as well as outdoor seating. We got the bronte burger with fries and a shrimp pasta with salad. The shrimp pasta was pretty average, but the bronte burger was really good. Ive ordered it to go and for delivery since. Really recommend the bronte burger. Service was very slow, but they were very kind."
3038,"Ruby's Cafe is an australian style cafe. i love the shrimp pasta. it was a refreshing, light summer style pasta with a lemony pasta and cherry tomatoes. The burger is unique and it's it being on ciabatta bread instead of a burger bun. The wait times can be long especially weekend brunch. overall, i enjoyed my experience here and i will be trying to recreate the shrimp pasta this summer, but I don't think i'll actually come back"
3039,"Ruby's is a NY staple. It is a great, trendy feeling place to eat when you need something to eat, but don't feel like thinking about it too much. It's also a good place for simple yet tasty dishes. The fries are so good (def some of my fave fries in the city) especially with their aioli. The one thing you must try on the menu is the Whaleys -- it's one of the best burgers in the city! The shrimp pasta is also yummy and they have gluten free pasta! This location is always overflowingly packed. Expect to wait up to an hour plus (I often do).  Good thing is that they text you when your table is ready though and give you 5 mins to return. It's also easy to place a takeout order online via their website. All in all, it's a dependable spot to go when you just want something to eat and it's def worth a try."
3040,One of my favorite brunch places! I got the Bronte with a side of truffle fries and my friend got their pasta. Both were really flavorful! I love the truffle fries. They were the perfect amount of crisp and the truffle mayo just brings it to another level. I would say its one of the best fries I've ever had. The sandwich was also cooked medium rare which is just how I like it. The staff members were extremely nice and we only had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated. I would definitely come back again!
3041,"Stopped in and was seating pretty quickly outside. It was v cold out but it wasn't too bad in the covered outdoor area. Waitress and all staff were very nice and helpful, but it was the brunch rush so they were def busy and running around. We ordered rinks and they never came had to ask for them again and they came after we ate, but were good nonetheless. The food is really really good, and would come back to have it again. Egg sandwich and fries specifically were bomb."
3042,"Have been here a few times and it's always a great spot for lunch/brunch. Delicious dishes, friendly service and great prices. The outdoor area is a great place to sit. We had shrimp pastas, salad with pumpkin and roasted brussel sprouts. All were delicious."
3043,"Absolutely love going to Ruby's for brunch. They are super busy though, so I would recommend going early to put your name down and then shop around the area while you wait.I ordered the crispy rice bowl and that has become my favorite item on their menu so far. I have yet to be disappointed by anything else though. I wouldn't say their food is mind-blowing or anything extraordinary, but I enjoy the ambiance too. Their pastas are good and I love their strawberry and basil lemonade. Would definitely drop by one of their locations again and try something new."
3044,"I love Ruby's Cafe. I've been here a number of times, and I've yet to be disappointed. While there usually is a wait, it's totally worth it. I usually get a chai latte or an iced latte whenever I'm here. The Bronte burger is delicious, and you can't go wrong if you order this. Their pastas are a hit too! I'm missing their crab linguine, but I think it's not in season at the moment. The food always comes out hot and tastes fresh. Service is always on point, and I can't wait to come back!! It's always a go to spot of mine."
3045,"My go to spot if I ever bring family or friends. I've had the shrimp pasta here many times and it has never disappointed. I've brought my family here and tried amazing meals here - some faves besides the ultimate shrimp pasta are fried chicken burger, creamy chicken pasta and the crab linguine.I've tried the grain bowl here and the chicken avo salad in hopes of being healthy and for sure the salad will fill you up way more than the grain bowl. Also a tip if you're a brown liquor gal like me - they don't have any other spirit other than vodka for their mules/drinks because they do not have a full liquor license."
3046,"After years of having Ruby's Cafe on our Yelp bookmarks, my friend and I finally had the chance to check the place out. We arrived at 1:30pm and and they took down our name and number and texted us when our table was ready (45min).We ordered the Breakfast Bowl, the Spicy Italian Sausage Pasta, Strawberry Basil Lemonade, and Pineapple Mint Fresh Juice. Overall, we thought the food was just okay?- not what it was hyped up to be. However, in terms of service, I would say they are quick and efficient despite how busy they were."
3047,"Expectations were too high for this place! My friend and I came here around 1:30pm on a Friday afternoon and we had to wait ~45 mins for our table. They take your name and number and will text you when your table is ready.The service was just okay, no fuss and nothing extraordinary. The spicy italian sausage rigatoni pasta was not spicy at all  The flavors were a little bland and I expected the sauce to be a little thicker. My friend thought her breakfast bowl was just okay. The bowl only had a few pieces of prosciutto and the slice of avocado wasn't even cut up  I thought the food was going to be good but it was slightly below average. This place is very trendy and popular but not sure if it's worth the hype. Maybe the burgers are better (?)I would pass and find another place to go."
3048,"I came back here with one of my friends and we noticed that one of the waitresses was wearing a ""vintage"" Ruby's sweater that said ""CAFE est. 2002"" in collegiate font across the chest. I believe it was a navy sweater with red font but unfortunately I can't find it on the Ruby's merch site. @Ruby's commerce team: Please bring it back!! You have 2 people that would love to purchase it"
3049,"Ruby's Cafe is a casual spot to grab breakfast, lunch, or dinner. They offer your typical American dishes with an Australian influence. Classic Cheeseburger ($14) - Not much to say other than this was a great rendition on a classic menu item. A delicious blend of locally sourced ingredients topped with a special sauce will curb any burger craving you might be experiencing. Also comes with a side of the crispest fries ever! Shrimp Pasta ($16.5) - A large portion of spaghetti, grilled shrimp, and an assortment of garnishes makes this a tasty addition to have at the table.Overall a yummy place to grab a meal at any time. They don't take reservations, so expect a wait if you are looking to come during peak hours!"
3050,"Idk how many times I've been here, but oh I just love their shrimp pasta so much. The lamb ragu was also amazing - meat sauce and cheese go so well together mixed with Al dente flat pasta noodles. Their menu is comprehensive but doesn't overwhelm you with a million items. Gorgeous interior and outdoor seating area as well."
3051,"tldr: reliable brunch spot for late minute plans!Food: 4/4Drinks: 4/5Vibes: 4/5Service: 5/5Must-Orders: Ruby's RaguRuby's has a lot of hype- so naturally we made a stop at the Soho location to check it out. Since they don't take reservations, we showed up around 10am on a Saturday and didn't have to wait at all! I would 100% choose this place for a solid brunch spot in the future; as long as you don't try to come get a table at peak times, you should be fine.We ordered the Ruby's Ragu and the Breakfast Bowl! The Bowl was a little messy to eat, but overall a good combination of flavors! Just wish there was less ricotta and more prosciutto. The Ragu was major comfort food goals and the noodles were cooked just right! Our waitress was so lovely and always made sure we had enough water and gave us recommendations. I would come back for sure!"
3052,"I can't stop thinking about those truffle fries!Don't come here during peak times like my friend and I, who had to wait over a hour. But nonetheless, it prepared my belly and palette to be empty for the excellent food that came after.The service was fast and friendly. I ordered the Bronte ($14.50) and my friend had Ruby's Ragu ($16.50), with Fries with Truffle Aioli ($7) to share. For drinks, we had the Fresh Young Coconut ($7) and That Watermelon Drink ($12). FYI, their Frozen Margaritas were only for the summer. I was disappointed the lady didn't allow me to get the truffle fries as a side to my burger as I saw many menu photos offer that. That Watermelon Drink was pretty darn refreshing. It was strong, but blended and balanced so well with a mix of vodka and watermelon taste. Definitely a must get! I speak the same for the Fries with Truffle Aioli, as they were the perfect juxtaposition of crispy on the outside and hearty and soft on the inside. The Bronte was also worth the popularity, as I usually don't get burgers. But this, was saucy. It was sweet, slightly tangy, and the beef patty was a unique texture that was insanely juicy. There was not a single dry texture in those bites!Cleanliness wise, I was pretty uncomfortable with especially during this time, given I saw the workers decorate drinks without gloves on. But the food and drinks we tried were truly worth the hype, and I could see why this place has long lines. A place to check off in your list of brunch places for sure."
3053,"Have been coming here for years and it's a solid place. It's Australian , my favorites- kale salad , shrimp pasta, and Brontë burger. Waits can be long at night or the weekends. I have tried another location and it wasn't as good as the mulberry."
3054,"I was mind blown by the food experience here! Not to mention staff were all super friendly. We went on a Saturday morning and the wait was about 1 hour - but don't fret, the food is so worth the wait. They'll text you when you're table is ready so meanwhile, there are lots of shops/stores you can look around. You also can't make reservations online - it's walk-ins only. We got the bronte burger and the crispy grain bowl along with vegemite toast for appetizer. My friend wanted me to try vegemite because it's supposively an Australian staple? For those that haven't had it - be warned... it is very bitter and salty and similar to what Chinese medicine would taste like... You're supposed to eat the spread along with the butter. I wasn't a big fan but it was fun to try! You might find yourself liking it. The Bronte Burger and the Crispy Grain were both amazing 10/10! The burger is so juicy yet crispy - it tasted more like a panini to me. The crispy fries with garlic aioli... to die for! Probably the best fries combo I've tasted. Crispy grain is so unique! I love ordering bowls from restaurants but I've never had crispy grains at a restaurant - which is a fantastic idea!! I'm so glad my friend showed me this place ... I still can't stop thinking about how amazing the food was. Definitely have to come back again and show other people this amazing place."
3055,"I went to Ruby's Cafe for brunch and ordered the Shrimp Pasta (supposedly their most popular pasta dish). As a whole, the dish was good, but the spaghetti was honestly not that special and the sauce could've been creamier. The other additions to the dish (shrimp, cherry tomatoes, arugula, and breadcrumbs) were pretty standard in quality. The $16.50 price is fair.An important thing to note is that Ruby's does not accept reservations and the wait times can get a bit lengthy during peak brunch hours. After managing to get a table, the service speed was pretty fast and the staff were friendly. The interior space is somewhat small and opened to face the sidewalk, and there is also outdoor seating. There are some tasteful designs on the wall highlighting the fact that this is an Australian-style cafe.Overall, Ruby's is a solid brunch spot, albeit not particularly amazing. I would make a visit if the wait time isn't too long."
3056,"This place is never empty. Im amazed. Maybe during the first hour of opening. Otherwise, be ready to wait for a table.It's your standard Aussie cafe with all the gewds, e.g. banana bread, vegemite and sourdough. Consistent flavor and chill vibes. Definitely recommend, and be prepared to wait in line."
3057,"We came here during lunch break and I think this is probably the only times where the line isn't as crazy. This place is ALWAYS PACKED. This place was overall good, the food was good, the flavors were there, but I'd stick with the 3 stars. It was standard brunch/lunch spot. We ordered the truffles fries which is always a hit. I love truffles fries and anytime they are on the menu, I have to get them. The fries were perfectly crispy and salty and the truffle was def. there. We also ordered the bronte burger, which I have to say was a 10/10 for me. The patty was not overly cooked at all, so it was super juicy and flavorful. The bread was not too hard and not stale at all, and was a good sandwich to soak in all the juices from the patty. Always enjoy a good, juicy, and flavorful burger. We also ordered a bowl, with a poached egg. The bowl was packed with ingredients and was flavorful. We drizzled hot sauce to give it a kick. This is def. a good choice for a lunch option, when you do not want to get too full or dive into the dinner options. Overall, not a bad experience."
3058,"Ok, I absolutely loved this place. I went here a couple months ago and I just forgot to write a review, but I'm doing it now. I found this spot after a long day of walking and I desperately needed some good pasta. I ordered the spicy italian sausage pasta and some truffle fries to share. The food came out very fast and it was DELICIOUS. Maybe it was because I was starving, but that pasta was amazing. It was so flavorful and I finished the plate in less than 5 minutes. The fries were also on another level. I just couldn't stop eating. I would definitely go there again to try a different pasta or their burgers!!"
3059,"Latest popular restaurant that's 100% worth the hype! Been wanting to check out this restaurant and was so glad that we did so on Friday for dinner. We got there at about 7:30pm and saw that the place was packed for both indoor and outdoor dining. We placed our name on the waitlist with the hostess and waited for about 40 minutes until our table is ready. We were seated outdoors and I have to say that the set up is absolutely adorable. The plant decorations are so neat and it really adds to the ambience. There are also a number of fans to keep the seating areas cool. The food itself was top notch. We ordered the classic shrimp pasta and the bronte. Both dishes were delicious and you really can't go wrong if you order either one of the dishes. The service is also really good. My boyfriend wanted to order a beer but all the ones he wanted were out which was disappointing. However, the waitress was really nice and offered us a beer on the house to make up for it which we greatly appreciate. This place is honestly a 10/10. The food is delicious and the service is great. Just try to come early if you're thinking of checking it out to make sure that you can secure a table before the wait time gets really long."
3060,"We went to Ruby's for a late brunch on Sunday and it was hopping but we ended up not needing to wait for a table. I was interested in trying Australian food that wasn't from Outback Steakhouse but it turns out their brunch menu was pretty standard. (I did not feel adventurous enough to try the Vegamite toast).We started by splitting the toasted banana bread with passion fruit butter. I love that they toasted the banana bread, definitely something I will try at home. The butter was sweat and different.I also got a breakfast sandwich, which looked like it would be messy to eat but it was not. A good portion size: not too much but definitely filling. This was opposed to the sweet corn fritters that my girlfriend got, which came with bacon and pretty big salad.Special shoutout to the cappuccino, which was presented really well and tasted delicious. They didn't have skim milk but 2% made it even creamier.My friend loves this place and, honestly, there were a dozen other things on the menu that I would have liked to try. I will be back!"
3061,This location is a lot more robust than the one in the East Village - there is a long wait usually but the hostess will send a text within 5 min of when you can be seated. Tried the classics - the burger and the chicken sandwich. 10/10 would recommend both but if I had to choose it would be the chicken sandwich! The side dishes of fries are also very very generous (+$3).
3062,"Omg where do I even start?! I came here with a friend who lives locally and was sooooo glad we did! I ordered the Green Egg Bowl, which was amazing. Mind you, I hate green food (kale, spinach, etc) but this bowl made it taste delicious! I came back the next day and ordered it again! THE PANCAKES - The Ricotta Nutella pancakes were the best pancakes I have ever had in my 28 years of life. I got them the next day as well. I could eat these everyday for the rest of my life. Don't hesitate, get the pancakes!!!The restaurant is super cute and cozy! We sat in the outdoor seating both visits and loved every minute of it! Everyone working there was super sweet and helpful. Overall 10/10 experience. If I lived in New York, i'd come here daily"
3063,"Ruby's is a freaking amazing place and I definitely NEED to go back again! Everything was super affordable and absolutely delicious. Overall, it gets really busy so it's best to come early. There is really beautiful and ample outdoor seating. If I could, I'd give it a 12/10!! I ordered the avocado toast which was both tangy and refreshing. The avocado was creamy, and the bread was thick with a crispy crust and soft center.  I also ordered the brussel sprouts which were seasoned deliciously, and each bite was so crispy and flavorful. They were really well roasted and I'm so in love with how flavorful they were."
3064,"This place has a little bit of everything: burgers, pasta, salads. We got a side of fries with the truffle aioli. The fries were good, and the truffle aioli was amazing! For my meal, I had the Spicy Italian Sausage pasta. The noodles and sauce were really good, but the baby peas didn't really add anything. This place has several locations in NYC. Overall, the food is great, and I can't wait to come back and try something from their brunch menu!"
3065,"Can't stop thinking about the ragu.... order the ragu!!!! It was seriously the most delicious pasta dish I've had in a really long time and of course you wouldn't expect it from a little cafe.The lemonade was yummy, and we really loved the feel of this place! Super cute with delicious food, what more could you ask for?!"
3066,Really wanted to love this place as the reviews are amazing. The food was actually pretty great. The service was a bit..weird? We kind of were rushed through our lunch. The waitress kept asking if we wanted the check about 15-20 min after our meal. We had only been sitting for about 45 min at that time which was kind of annoying. Wanted to give 5 but 4 star because of wait staff.
3067,"Cute and fun spot that I would definitely return to! It feels like a quintessential place to go to! Go with a group of friends! They don't take resos tho, so expect a wait becuase this place is definitely busyFood: they have a menu where anyone can find something that they like- from pastas, to burgers, to bowls! I ordered the bondi burger, with sweet potato fries and the ginger beer! The burger was amazing! The chicken was very tasty, grilled. and spiced super well (this is definitely a spicier option). The chili sauce that was in the burger was so flavorful and complimented the chicken so well! The sweet potato fries were also SO good, they were battered differently than other sweet potato fries which was so good! I also liked the ginger beer! Ambience: this place is happening! They have SO many people coming in, so expect it to be very crowded. I had to wait 45 mins to get a table. The seating feels a bit tight. I sat outside and they have plexi glass separating you from the next table, which I liked! They also give you sanitizer at the table! The bathroom situation is a bit wonky! They have 1 stall and it is near the kitchen, so as you wait, you will be sweating! Price: everything feels reasonably priced here! You can get a main course for $20 or less!!"
3068,"Delicious Aussie cafe in the SoHo neighborhood. We wanted to eat a late brunch ~3 pm on a weekday, and still had to wait 45 minutes to be seated (no worries when there's so many shops around!). We got the shrimp salad, a grain bowl and a side of fries. Honestly a satisfying, filling meal that was only made better by a dear friend to share it with. Fast service, long waits but well worth it. Will definitely be back. Cute outdoor and indoor seating, but definitely prefer the outdoor."
3069,"Very good for brunch. I heard a lot of good things about this place so I had to try it out. The pancakes were delicious, the Brussel sprouts and sautéed vegetables were very good. Even got a salad to go for lunch the next day. Everything I had was good. Definitely coming back."
3070,"Ruby's has been an all time favorite of mine for a long time. I generally try to avoid repeating restaurants in the city but I've been to Ruby's many many times already. The exterior is beautifully set up and they have really good covid protocols in place. The service is excellent! But the FOOD is AMAZING. Everything i've tried on the menu is so good. My favorites are the chia muesli and fried chicken burger. Ruby's also has the BEST fries i've ever tried. I wish I could eat them everyday. My friend got the avocado toast (and i generally refrain from spending money on something so simple I can make at home) but this was the best avocado toast i've ever had. As if it couldn't get any better, everything here is SUPER affordable. I love this place and will definitely be back."
3071,"Ruby's Cafe Ratings: 4.8/5 Food: 5/5 - Came here on a random Sunday night for dinner, and this place was PERFECT, literally won't change a thing here. We order two entrees to share and thought they were the best thing we had that day. We ordered the Malibu Bowl (I'm usually not a salad person), but it was the best salad bowl I have ever had in my life. It has brown rice, poached egg, avocado, broccolini, edamame, pea shoots, and watermelon radish, and herbs. Ingredients were super fresh, texture was amazing with a good mixture of crunchiness, and the dressing was FIRE. It has an acidic taste to it, but super refreshing where you will just want to keep eating it. It is light and all the flavors balances out each out so well. I love the watermelon radish. I am in love with this bowl. The second entree was the Creamy Chicken Pasta, and once again didn't disappoint at all. It's rigatoni pasta with sun dried tomatoes, cooked in a basil cream sauce and topped with Parmesan cheese. Pasta was al dente, chewy, and firm. Chicken breast was tender and juicy. The sun dried tomatoes and the creamy sauce was wonderful, so delicious that we devoured both dishes really quickly. Ambiance: 4.75/5 - This Australian restaurant is super cute, cozy, with a very boogie vibe to it, but I somehow really like it. The interior decor is great with a good selection of background music. Interior is quite pink and intimate. There are plenty of indoor and outdoor seating available, but this place is always packed, so prepare to wait in line. This is the perfect spot for a boozy brunch, friends gatherings, and/or date nights. Price: 4.75/5 - The Creamy Chicken pasta was $16 and the Malibu Bowl was $14, and if you want to add protein to the salad then there will be an extra charge. Ruby's Cafe prices are super reasonable, definitely a steal for the quality and taste of the food, super WORTH the $$$. The portions are great too, enough to make me full, so you know it's a big portion. The total came up to be around $40 - $45 after tax and tips. Service: 4.75/5 - There was no wait around 8:00pm, so we got seated fairly quick. The staffs are friendly and nice, and the service was pretty fast. Our water glasses were always full, and everyone seem to be super chill and cool. They were also super accommodating, because we asked them if they can lower the music down a bit since it was a bit too loud for us to chat, and they gladly did it. I appreciate it and felt like we were cared for a lot. BLUF: This is hands down my top 5 restaurant spots in NYC right now. Amazing place for Australian food all day long, you can go for brunch or dinner. Definitely recommends and be prepared to get your mind blown away. Everything here is outstanding, so can't go wrong with anything you order, but would you got to try their pasta here."
3072,"The go-to brunch spot! Starting with the good, the sandwich was really good I loved the sauce and the fries were amazing i also tried the green eggs bowl and the veggies were so good. the drinks, on the other hand, were not as good. The strawberry basil lemonade tasted like pizza ???? and the peach tea was basically water but luckily the food was good so it made up for the drinks ! I would definitely come back but I will no longer be ordering the drinksFollow @strwbrrryboba on insta for more pics and reviews :)"
3073,"All the food here looks delicious. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and as I was waiting for my food, the waiters and waitresses kept walking past with the most beautifully plated breakfasts. My egg sandwich was great - egg was perfectly runny. The only downside is brunch wait times are very long, but that's how you know it's good!"
3074,"Lovely food. pasta, burger. one of my fav place to get fries and that aoili. prob staff are a lil forgetful from how busy it is. The outdoor seating wasnt the best, especially when it rains, you better get ready to get soaked. It's a free shower."
3075,"I absolutely love this place. Excellent fries, rigatoni , shrimp salad and drinks. Every time I come to NY, I have to come by."
3076,"One of the ABSOLUTE BEST brunch spots in the city! This place is incredible and it has never disappointed on the several occasions I have come here. The prices are affordable, especially for such an area and quality of food.I came in the afternoon with family on a weekday. We were told it would be a 30 minute wait which sounded on par, the place was packed to the brim with no open tables in sight. The waiter added us to the waitlist and I got the text that our table was ready within 7 minutes! We were seated quickly, ordered our food which came out within 15 minutes.I ordered an iced latte with almond milk. 7/10, it's as good as you would think an iced latte with almond milk would taste. Nothing special, but still good! For lunch I ordered the Bluey's Chicken Sandwich with sweet potato fries 10/10. The sandwich was full of flavor, the chicken sweet and tender. The sweet potato fries were sweet and crunchy. My family and I ordered some fries with truffle to share for the table as well which were BOMB!I cannot wait to come back here."
3077,"I went to Ruby's Cafe this Sunday at 1:30pm. Outdoor dining currently -- YES, there are heaters! WALK INS only, no reservations. We were put into the queue and was told it would be 1 hour 45 minute wait time. We walked around Soho until we got a text notifying us of an available table. This Australian cafe serves a menu with burgers, fish, pasta, salads, and sandwiches. We started with the fries with truffle aioli ($6) which I highly recommend! They were just the right level of crispy and the dip really complimented the fries. This was actually my favorite part of the meal. I opted for the pesto pasta ($14) with kale, baby peas, snap peas, and zucchini and added bacon (+$3.50). The pasta was okay but overly salty. Too much pesto added -- almost half the dish that I had leftover was pesto.I heard they are best known for their burgers, so maybe I will try one for my next visit. Definitely will not wait 2 hours for a table again though.A 7.5% covid-19 recovery charge will be added to each check!"
3078,"I've been here 3 times and everytime, I leave feeling satisfied and full The vibe is very milleinial and has great music Their food is pretty cheap and delicous with good portions. As a broke student, this place is definitely worth your money"
3079,"It was a nice day out so we chose outdoor dining. Have to say that their table spacing is super tight, my friend and I felt a bit uncomfortable chatting away because of the close proximity of other patrons next to us. That being said, their food was awesome and it has a cute vibe overall. Loved that the bronte burger came in ciabatta and not a plain ol' bun, it made it unique and delicious. The shrimp pasta stole the show though; it was a perfect balance of creamy and zesty, with a hint of freshness due to the addition of arugula. Would love to return to eat away their menu!"
3080,"Had the most amazing bday din at la contenta!! Can not recommend this place enough -- the food was delicious, the drinks were fun and tasty, and the service was incredible (thank you Norma!). They printed a really cute custom menu to go with a very reasonably priced pre-fixed din, made me a ""happy birthday"" chocolate flan cake that they brought out with candles, and even brought out tequila shots for the table at the end of din (mine was in a champagne glass - so cute!) I would give this place a 6 out of 5 if I could. Thank you la contenta!"
3081,"Setting. We sat out doors. Tables are kinda close together. Not bad!Food. Enchiladas de camarón. Beans and enchiladas were good. Rice was okay.Chicken mole, the chicken was tender. The mole went very well with the rice and plantains, mole with chicken may be an acquired taste. Michelada de tamarindo was perfect! Food overall was 3.5/5Service: 5/5. Super friendlyCost. Appetizers are about $15, Entrees are about $22, cocktails run $9-15."
3082,Getting ready to leave the city. Used Yelp to find Tacos. Led me here based on photos and reviews. Arrived and chose to sit at the bar as opposed to the seat we were offered. We would've been entirely too close to the other guest and squeezed into a corner. Tight spot equals not a good space to enjoy a meal. . Restaurant is quite tiny also and she warned that the inside was hot. She didn't lie but it was tolerable for me. Tepache Apache - Ordered a drink made with fermented pineapple rind and pineapple purée. It was yummy and strong. Chips and Salsa - Chips thicker than I'm used too for sure. Salsa also different. It was smooth and had creamy notes and undertones of pinto beans. I wanted to ask to see if I was right but the language barrier prevented it. Guacamole - Presented beautifully but lacked seasoning/flavor for me. It needed more lime and s&p. Catfish Tacos - The fish was fried perfectly and the slaw and sauces were delicious together. A good three bites and it was demolished. Birria Taco - I assumed it was the Birria Birria tacos and it was not. Bummer. They were still quite delicious though. The beef was super tender and flavorful and the sauce on top was spiccccccccy but tolerable for me. I definitely return and try something on the entree side of the menu next time.
3083,"It's been hard to snag a dinner spot here given the limited seating and the inability to make a reservation. So we thought it was a better time to go for a weekday lunch during my staycation.The coffee was good and so were their cocktails, which were very cheap during the lunch hour for about 9 dollars a drink. We each ended up getting two. The pear one was delicious. I was less of a fan of my second drink, which was the mimosa mainly because it required serial dilutions of water to  balance out the sweetnessMy friend got the french toast which started out delicious but did become a little soggy from being doused with syrup and whatever jam they put on it. My fish tacos were good, but nothing spectacular. I am afraid to admit and agree with the west coast folks that NYC's taco scene needs a reinvigoration. I would check this out again for brunch/lunch and happy hour but not sure if the food is worth the 30+ minute dinner wait."
3084,Service was super friendly. Def recommend the nachos! Best thing I had there. The tacos de carne asada was good too along with tacos dr pescado. Would go back for mainly the drinks and nachos
3085,The chips and guacamole were really delicious. The chicken nachos are out of this world & presented nicely. I also ordered three of the sweetest drinks on the menu and they were way too bitter for my taste. They were small and cost $60 in total. Idk if that's just because we are in New York but in Northern Virginia/DC I've never had to pay that much for drinks of that quality and size. It also didn't help that the prices were not listed on the menu. There was a small mixup in the beginning as well because our waiter didn't speak the best English but everything was fine once it arrived. We also ordered tres leches. Was disappointed to find out it was not the Mexican tres leches were used to but instead more of a bread pudding with a scoop of ice cream on top. From the previous reviews I have a feeling they just gave this to us and called it tres leches bc they ran out...
3086,Went for happy hour and drinks were amazing! Fish tacos had a sauce that complemented the fish. Carne asada had a good flavor and was soft. Absolutely loved it all
3087,"Tiny little taco shop downtown on Norfolk Street.  Great vibe here.  Lots of people waiting for food.  And the tacos are REALLY great.Friendly service and the prices are reasonable.  Also, the restaurant is very clean so that's worth mentioning."
3088,"Very adorable hole in the wall looking place. Food was unreal, service was great and the place (inside and outside) was vibing. We sat outside since the weather was beautiful in the evening. Restaurant took many precautions for COVID which was comforting.Never had nachos served the way they were here - round plate, every chip had all condiments on it - you didn't have to fish around for stuff and break the chips while dipping.Enchiladas are my go to at most Mexican places. I love the dish and love to compare flavors. I was a happy camper on these ones. My husband had the branzino which he also loved. I recommend all three dishes."
3089,"The food is great as is the service. My shrimp enchiladas were excellent, love the sauce and the black beans. Guacamole and chips are pricey but tasty.The mole on roasted chicken was also very good."
3090,"Found this place on help! Me and my girlfriend are having a ""mommy staycation"" and we wanted to start our night off with happy hour! We called and were told no reservations were needed and we can just come. PERFECT!!!! Although we got there after happy hour we didn't care. We still wanted a drink. When we arrived we sat at the bar. Our bartender's name was Lalo. He was very pleasant took our drinks order and food orders. Every was soooo good especially our drink! This place is definitely a Gem!!! We will be back!"
3091,"First time, AMAZING! The food is authentic Mexican food and the environment makes me feel like I am in Mexico. I got the chilaquiles and the were 10/10."
3092,"Came here on a Saturday, very cool atmosphere. Ordered the steak tacos (my favorite) and fish tacos. For drinks we tried the Oaxaca express and the el mixteco margaritas as recommended by the waiter.  El mixteco did not disappoint. It was sweet and strong at the same time. This is a very casual place. This recommended for small groups and a quick bite."
3093,"I LOVED my quesadilla - although it was quite messy to eat. It came with lots of toppings and was very flavorful. I requested that they add black beans to the quesadilla, which they did (some places say no!), and it was great. I picked up my food to go, but I saw that the restaurant was very busy, and people's drinks looked REALLY good."
3094,"The food is really terrific here. I love coming to get the catfish tacos, guacamole, or any of the shrimp dishes. The cocktails are so delicious that you can't just have one. Besides the comfortable outdoor seating in little booths, with radiators, and sliding barn doors, the waiter service is really wonderful. Mario was constantly checking up on us outside and he was so friendly, as well as polite. Having fantastic service on top of amazing food really makes for a wonderful evening."
3095,"wow where do I even start? My host, who happens to also turn out to be the waitress, ushered us in immediately as soon as my other party got here. Granted the restaurant was smaller than pictured on Yelp, but that wasn't an issue for us. The decor was cute and quirky, and the bartenders really did go in and put their blood sweat and tears into making my drink tasty. I'm not even going to lie, I felt like I was away in Mexico for a sheer bliss for 30 minutes My friend had ordered an entrée and dessert all in one. When I asked why he had done so, he said he could not resist waiting for dessert when it already had sounded so delicious the minute he landed his eyes on it, LOL. Needless to say we scarfed down everything we ordered faster than the time it took to be made. Our hostess/Waze waitress Norma, had been exceptional and I sincerely hope she finds a place in life where she can be appreciated or recognized for her high ambition and diligence. I did not anticipate this kind of elevated experience from such a small restaurant, let alone during  such a difficult period such as modern day Great Depression.  My experience had surpassed my expectations far beyond anything else. I definitely have to come back, and support a small business. And please patrons, if you feel like the service was just, do your part in tipping considerable/considerate amount. My friend and I agreed this place was definitely worth tipping over 20%. Mind you, I never tip over 15% anywhere, given the stingy person that I naturally am. But I found it worth it for La Contenta"
3096,"A small little spot on the corner of Delancey, literally a hole in the wall! They did have outdoor dining with heating lamps hanging from the top, but it honestly was still freezing cold (it was like 37 degrees that night). Our waitress was super friendly and popped back in to check up on us so frequently! I've been here before for the cocktails, but it was my first time trying their tacos and enchiladas. Each taco order comes with 2 tacos, so my friend and I ordered the Tacos de Pescada -$14 (catfish tacos) to share and we each got the Enchiladas de Camaron - $22 (shrimp). We thought the catfish tacos were on the plainer side...kind of disappointing. It didn't feel like it had enough sauce or toppings. Just a fried catfish on a dry taco shell. On the other hand, the enchiladas were wayyy better. It was a perfect serving size for one person, two skinny enchiladas and a good portion of rice & beans. It's a very filling plate tho!For cocktails we got El Mixteco ($14), Pulque de Guayaba ($14), and the Oaxaca Express ($14). I was expecting the Mixteco to be sweet, but it had a very Smokey aftertaste to it. Oaxaca was on the bitter Smokey side too, and a little spicy and cucumbery. The Guayaba was the sweetest out of the three and probably my favorite."
3097,Amazing service and excellent food! I have trouble finding good Mexican food in Nyc and this place goes above and beyond! Super friendly staff as well
3098,"Came here for dinner on a Thursday night with my cousin. It's conveniently located off the Delancey train station. We got the queso fundido as an appetizer- yum, yum! I ordered the motezuma drink (I'm a passion fruit fan). It was a tasty, fruity drink. We ordered the fish tacos and carne asada tacos. The fish tacos were a little spicy for me but we still ate them up! The service was very good as well. It's a cute restaurant but very tiny. They should totally think about expanding!"
3099,"Great place for Mexican cuisine and cocktails! I got the spicy margarita, and chicken tacos - loved all of them. Staff was friendly too."
3100,"Great spot with friendly and efficient service, good drinks (try the Puerto Vallarta), and excellent food. We sat outside, tables were packed in tightly, on a lovely summer night. Free chips and salsa started us out and then an appetizer of the torta de camarones, which was very tasty, served drenched with a spicy and flavorful sauce. Carne asada tacos hit the spot, although two per order is likely not enough for a full dinner if you are hungry. The chicken with mole was fantastic, a nicely balanced mole, healthy portion (I shared a lot of it with my dinner mate), and served over wild grain rice and plantains. We left happy and will definitely return when back in the neighborhood."
3101,"Happy hour deals are great! $10 apps/tacos and $10 cocktails. Guacamole and chips are a must! It comes with a little side of chili chipotle sauce, and it was amazing with the fresh guacamole. I read that the fish tacos were to die for here but I found them to be average. A little too much fried batter on the fish and nothing really special.The tacos that wowed me were the carne asada tacos! Meat was so tender, juicy, and medium-rare. I loved it! I wish they offered a burrito bowl with that carne asada. Definitely recommend these tacos. The la contenta cocktail was my favorite, refreshing grapefruit flavor and they were not cheap with the tequila! We had the chocolate soufflé for dessert and it was delicious. Cinnamon ice cream topped onto soft chocolate soufflé. Unfortunately I found a red lipstick stain on my water glass so I took off a star. It was concerning that the cleanliness wasn't up to par given the risky times right now and with their good reviews."
3102,"What a great first experience at La Contenta. I sat at the bar and watched the bartenders make great cocktails, including my two, the Pulque de Guayaba and The Mayan. They were both excellent.My entree was the Chile Relleno y Succotash and it too was excellent. I'll be back."
3103,"I am a Texas native who has lived in NYC for 22 years. Mexican-American (distinct from Tex-Mex) food is a particular interest of mine.  I long ago gave up on trying to find an authentic Mexican-American dining experience in NYC.  The places where the food is good enough are pretentious and pricey (which is inauthentic alone).  The places priced within my usual reach, while competent enough, still disappoint, usually because they have adjusted the seasoning to accommodate the northeastern palate (which I can hardly blame them for).La Contenta provides the Mexican-American dining experience I miss.  I've been twice, both for weekend brunch.  On the first visit I didn't make my usual Mexican breakfast choice, Huevos Rancheros, because I have been so often disappointed by what people north of Dallas/Fort Worth believe this dish to be.  I ordered Chilaquiles instead, because that's a dish that doesn't really have a standard form, it's a bit different everywhere it is made, even in Mexico.  I like what they do with Chilaquiles, and that was what encouraged me to make a return visit.On the second visit, I had the Huevos Rancheros, and when I tasted guajillo peppers in the ranchero sauce I was transported to my favorite haunts back home.  They get it, they know this dish, they get it right.  That's a first in this part of the country for me in two decades of being disappointed time after time.  The dish was assembled correctly, the layers went on in the right order, and accordingly served upon fried (but not fried hard) corn tortillas. To celebrate this moment of reunion with a favored staple, I didn't even turn to look at the bar to survey the selection of tequila, because after sampling the Heuvos Rancheros I knew they would have my choice, Clase Azul Reposado.  They do, and I finshed off the meal with a shot neat.  I almost expected to wander outside and see piñatas available for parents to take home to the kids.From the music, to the menu, to the servers, to the rhythm of the service, to the cocktail menu, to the food choices available, to the selection at the bar, to the mindful attention to the house-made salsas, La Contenta delivers a truly authentic (to this Texan) Mexican-American dining experience."
3104,Me and my family ordered a little bit of everything and oh was it good. So much flavor and a joy spending time with family with amazing food to swallow down the conversation. The Biria tacos were my favorite. Will be back and recommend. And don't forget to try the drinks the spicy margarita is off the hook. Great brunch spot as well.
3105,Pescado and carne asada tacos were excellent. Go for the sparkling wine sangria over a regular mimosa. You won't be disappointed!
3106,The best Mexican place ever the food the staff are amazing I'd definitely recommend this place for everyone
3107,"The food was really tasty! The fish tacos are amazing and the drinks are refreshing and strong . The nachos were also good, highly recommend."
3108,"This place was an unexpected gem in the LES. Around the corner from The Delancey, this tiny Mexican fonda prepares authentic Mexican food and other twists at pretty decent prices.I had a Hanger steak that was amazing; juicy and flavorful. It came with the most amazing cheese-loaded baked potato and baby spinach with a light and tangy dressing. I couldn't resist ordering the queso fundido. It was a dream. It comes with a lining of savory huitlacoche,  making it a type of QF that you just can't find anywhere else. Oh, and their red salsa that comes with totopos is amazing.I hope you check out this place and I hope Oscar helps you. He is amazing, knowledgeable about the restaurant's plates and a lot of fun."
3109,Good and drinks is good but the service is very slow. I wait for table (I believe I am a first on the list but she take some big table just arrive first) but it's ok just don't do that with another party again!
3110,"Pretty decent spot for mexican food with a great drinks menu. They have a happy hour but it seems like it ends at 6. Long story short, their food is really great but it's a little pricier than i would have preferred.We tried:- the mayan (drink) 9/10: it was an excellent mix of slightly sour and alcohol, wish there was a little more liquid..the drink was pretty small- la contenta nachos 8/10: nachos were pretty good and i liked the abundance and variety of toppings; but ultimately thought the price to portion ratio could have been better- tacos de carne asada 7/10: also quite yummy and the meat was incredibly tender -- but i'm personally not a fan of really expensive ""premium"" tacos- pollo en mole 9/10: i'm always on the lookout for mole dishes delicious mole and the chicken was surprisingly very juicy! only downside is the price"
3111,"Please go support this restaurant! They have covered safe outdoor dining (partitions up) with heaters during covid outdoor dining only (writing this in January 2021). Even though it was busy we were not near anyone else. Food was great and drinks are fun and different. The service was also THE BEST! Super attentive, friendly and just all around made the dining experience even better. Will definitely come back again."
3112,"La Contenta is second to none and I mean it. It's an honor and a pleasure to give this restaurant five stars. Right off the top, it's a small place but don't get it twisted, it's very popular and for good reason. The music and staff was pitch perfect. I found the vibe and energy of the restaurant to be very festive and fun. I arrived a bit earlier then my friend but they still sat me and that's highly unusual. I was prepared to either have a drink at the bar or wait outside. So I was seated and the lovely waitress promptly served me the freshly made chips and salsa. I order a drink off their drink menu and I have to tell you, the bartenders at La Contenta really know how to make a drink. Between my friend and I, we tried four drinks off the menu and each one was amazing. For dinner, I order their shrimp enchilada with the red sauce and grilled brussel sprouts. My goodness what a meal. I couldn't finish it all. La Contenta is definitely one of those restaurant that you would pass and say, wow, I'd like to try that place out one day. Make that one day - today and get your life. You won't be disappointed."
3113,Happy Hour here is my favorite. It is a close environment that give a cozy feel. I always take co-workers or friends here and sitting at the bar or calling ahead is usually your best bet. The margs are super good and pairs well with their guacamole. My favorite thing to eat is their fish tacos which happen to be on the Happy Hour Menu if you don't mind eating a little earlier. Friendly staff and all around amazing restaurant.
3114,WOW! Best Mexican in NYC. I love their steak tacos & I've heard their drinks are great too! Can't wait to try it in person instead of ordering takeout!
3115,"I am in love. We ordered quesadilla, nachos, chilaquiles, juevos ranchero, breakfast burrito and the Mexican style omelet and my friends and I are so happy with everything. The salsa was perfectly tangy and spicy. The produce is so flavorful- my sister can't get over the tomatoes. The beans and rice were too die for and the food was perfect! It's hands down my favorite Mexican place that I've been to in a while :)"
3116,"- Small restaurant with cute decorations. They really put a lot of thought into creating a particular atmosphere- The food was REALLY good- The portion sizes are big so even one appetizer per person can fill you up - Service was lacking. We sat down and it took a while for them to give us the menus. We ordered drinks and food at the same time yet it took 30min just for the drinks to come out. - The food took another 10min- Don't come here if you're hungry and looking to get your food right away. - When we were ready to get the check, we couldn't find someone available to help us. It felt like we spent most of our time trying to get someone's attention.- Make sure to sit at the bar so you can be looked after better"
3117,Lol this place sat us really quick and that was really nice. The guacamole was good but there was 4 pieces of tortilla chips. We had to get extra tortilla chips on the side. The tacos...... were so bad that we didn't even eat the second taco lol I had chicken skin inside my taco. It was disgusting. The drinks and service was amazing but I will not be going back unfortunately because of the food
3118,"Excellent bar service,  food was outstanding and bartender made us feel like family.  I'd return without question"
3119,I don't know why there's so many positive reviews... these were the nastiest tacos I've ever had. Their presentation is terrible and did not make me want to eat it. But whatever I tried it and let me tell you.. they were so gross. The staff however was attentive and constantly refilled our water glasses so that's a positive ?
3120,They indicated on their menu items that are gluten free. Sadly the chips were somehow not gluten free. Food was good and the fish dinner was unique and tasty
3121,"Great happy hour! They have lots of snacks, meals, and cocktails for happy hour from 3-6pm on weekdays. Their steak tacos were super filling and margaritas were great. It's a small spot, so not ideal for huge parties. But, it's great for catching up with a small group!"
3122,"La Contenta is my go to Mexican restaurant! They have so many yummy options: The guacamole , tacos de pescado, tacos de carne, enchiladas de camarón, hanger steak a la parrilla, Chilaquiles... the list goes on and on! Not only is the food amazing but also the cocktails are TO DIE FOR! They're so creative with their cocktails and carry a large variation of spirits. Trust me they will not disappoint. Alex is in charge of creating all those yummy cocktails! Overall, this restaurant will guarantee you an amazing experience! From the food to the drinks to decoration to the service! The staff from la Contenta always make you feel like you're visiting family. They have a sister location in the west village if you prefer a bigger space. Make sure you don't miss on checking them out! & like I've said before, time are hard right now. So please people don't be so harsh with your reviews. Try to be patient and more understanding with businesses! They will deeply appreciate it"
3123,Had a great meal.  We got the carne as casa tacos and mole chicken and was to die for.  No photos because we devoured our food.
3124,What a small space with some good food!! And the drinks were even better. Although it's very tight inside. Not that many tables. Very small space they make it work! Food was tasty. They never asked us if we wanted the sauce that came on the fish tacos... which we found to be a little strange. Good thing it wasn't bad tasting. Happy to have stopped in for the experience.
3125,"Ordered via Grubhub: fish tacos, birreria tacos and carne asada tacos to share amongst 2. Good portion size. Even though we picked up the order 10 min later than we would've wanted and drove back 15 minutes, all of the tacos held up. I bet they would be even more delicious had we eaten them at the restaurant. Overall, we were full and we thought the fish taco was the best, then carne asada, followed by the birreria. Friendly service. We would order again."
3126,"Our second time here during covid. Delicious fish tacos, nice outdoor setup, and excellent service. The churros were great too, will definitely return for more!"
3127,"Mmm Mmm Mmmmm!!! Hot day, craving a margarita....chose La Contenta and WOW how great. Air conditioned seat at the bar, only came in for a cool Marg, got a 'Mijito' delish! Then had to have guac and chips that lead to sharing a 2 taco plate with the hubby, carne asada grilled to perfection hanger steak. Was so happy when we left. Loved it and you will too!"
3128,"La Contenta is a casual, tiny Mexican spot on the Lower East Side popular for both dinner and brunch. Most offerings are familiar and well-executed-- think trusty margaritas, guac, and enchiladas-- but this is more authentic than your average New York Tex-Mex joint, with huitlacoche and Oaxacan cheese topping dishes alongside the usual shredded jack.I came with my boyfriend a couple months ago for Saturday brunch, and we were one of their first parties of the day around 11:30. Service was prompt and polite. Decor is simple, with the bold wall illustrations and a large bar dominating. No boozy brunch for us, despite the intriguing tequila-based cocktail list, though he had some hot and strong coffee.I went for camarones al ajillo ($15), plump shrimp doused with a slightly spicy and garlicky sauce. That sauce was definitely the highlight, rich with butter. The accompaniments were simple; a couple of tortillas, a little over-peppered salad, and Spanish rice.My boyfriend went for the huevos rancheros ($15), an impressive mountain of beans, tortilla chips, and salsa topped with two sunny side up eggs. Good stuff.This is some of the better Mexican I've had in New York, though I don't think it would stand out much in Houston (or anywhere else with a strong Mexican scene). If you're looking for a cute and reasonably priced spot to meet up with a friend or three, this will fit the bill."
3129,"Small little hole in the wall place with big flavor. Had the catfish taco and it was amazing the crunch when you bit into the fish combined with the soft texture is a must have. Also had the shrimp enchiladas and the shrimp was nice and tender, with a mild Smokey type of chipotle. The stand out winner and this may sound crazy was the rice and beans. It was just a different experience when taking a bite of something so simple. Dont skip this spot! The outdoor seating is nice during COVID for 2 and 4 parties but no complaints staff was friendly and well mannered too."
3130,"Dark, fun little Mexican spot with a great drink menu. We had a great experience the night we went and we will definitely be back. My friend was late arriving to dinner and I was fortunate enough to have the lovely hostess put a reserve sign on a bar seat next to me as I awaited. Since the place was empty at 6:15pm I was surprised she did that. But 10 minutes later the place was packed!!!While I waited I tried more than one of their specialty margaritas ranging from coconut infused to jalapeño spiked and liked each one. And I almost got full on the chips and salsa before we ordered dinner. In the end, the Ceviche was fresh, the tacos were great, and the rice and beans were delicious. We loved every plate and drink. Arrive there early as the seats go fast! But if you have to wait, it's worth it."
3131,"Cute but tiny Mexican restaurant on the LES notable for its super affordable happy hour with both drinks and food on the menu. It's a little pricey not on happy hour - I didn't look at a food menu, but the cocktails are $15-$16 and the micheladas (which I had) are $9 during regular hours. Now...the happy hour is at wacky times. I thought it went from 4-7, so I rushed out of work a little early to make it there by 6:15 on a Thursday only to find out that the happy hour ends at 6 Thursday through Saturday. My fault, so not not penalizing La Contenta for not checking their hours closely enough, but probably wouldn't have gone if I had known because again, it's pricey during normal times. Had an al pastor michelada ($9) which was good but a little heavy. Part of why I like micheladas is because they're very refreshing and this was, I don't know, too sweet and syrupy for my taste? One was great, but I wasn't too keen on having another. They have a few on the menu though, so maybe I picked wrong. They also give you the full beer, which is awesome. Definitely planning on coming back during happy hour but would probably pass otherwise."
3132,"This restaurant/bar is operating so smoothly even with COVID.  They have outdoor seating, and each seat is divided by plastic dividers. All of the servers wear masks and gloves and faceshields (and they wear their masks PROPERLY, covering both nose and mouth). Our waiter was very attentive to our table, and our glass of water was never empty. We ordered two drinks and a dish of chips and guacamole. The drinks were very well-made, and the guacamole was one of the most fresh I've ever tasted. I also loved the music they were playing in the background. Great spot for a casual date night or girls' night out!"
3133,"Decided to come here as it was one of the few places open late on a Sunday night and I am so glad with that decision. The ambience was nice with the music playing loudly, the candles lit, and the heat nice and warm on a cold night. The food was absolutely delicious. I devoured my Pollo en Mole which had great flavor and amazing tenderness and really just exceeded my expectations overall. The enchiladas were also delicious and I definitely plan to come back and try more things."
3134,I had wanted to eat here for a while so when I finally got to go I was really exited. It's super small and narrow but that's not a negative. I love the intimacy. But it is not family/kid friendly nor good for groups. The drinks were good and strong (which is also good). The chicken was moist and the Brussel sprouts were awesome. They were a great side for $5. Priced accordingly with the area. Long waits if you don't have a reservation and it's super hard to snag a seat at the bar. If you come on an off time or maybe just for drinks it might be less crowded.
3135,"If you have the time and patience to wait for happy hour or lunch, do it!! Their happy hour menu (ends at 7pm) has $10 drinks, tacos, and plates to share like quesadillas, nachos and queso. La Contenta has solid drinks that are well mixed - not too sweet like many other places offering mojitos and margaritas. I had the Mayan and the paloma and enjoyed both. But the happy hour food is even better. Get a big bowl of guacamole (they even stick in the chips for you) and it was more than enough to share for the four of us. The fried fish tacos were SO juicy and I was pretty full from the two big pieces. I wish it was a bit bigger - there's a row of 5-6 tables on the right and bar seats. Not a big space and the bathroom is petite too. Waiters are attentive and quick and didn't rush us to finish our drinks. Definitely coming back again next time we're in the LES!"
3136,"had high hopes for this place as it always seemed packed when i walked by and everyone raves about the fish tacos.service is 5 stars+ - super attentive servers and very friendly.the tacos themselves were just mediocre - the pieces were too large that they dont even fit in the taco so it's a really awkward meal to try to have civilly. great crunchy exterior, but the breading was a bit thick for my liking. accompanying rice and beans were nicely cooked and the beans had good flavor.i'm interesting in their other dishes, but would probably visit for dinner next time and not for brunch"
3137,"The restaurant was really accommodating to my friends and I, and it took us quite some time to finally put our order in (we were distracted, sorry!). The food was good, but I've def had better, hence the 4 stars. The waiter was really patient and helpful and the drinks were amazing, which would put this place at a 5. The food could have been seasoned a bit more. I ordered the chicken enchiladas which comes with rice and beans. The others ordered tacos which looked tasty but I didn't try any. I would def return and try other items on the menu."
3138,"This restaurant has been one of the most desired for its high quality.  I was completely disappointed today, everything we ordered was lacking in flavor and taste.  The guacamole tasted like pure smashed avocado completely lifeless. I do not know if they are the ravages of the pandemic but I hope they can recover their original glory."
3139,"Let me just start off by saying that La Contenta is a gem, but a very tiny gem. Even as a petite woman, I felt pretty uncomfortable throughout our meal, due to the fact that the tables are very tightly squeezed together and you are almost rubbing elbows with your neighbors. Avoid if you have claustrophobic tendencies or tend to gesture animatedly when you talk. The bathroom is also one of the most minuscule I have ever seen. I would recommend using the bathroom elsewhere if you can.Other than that, I had a good time at La Contenta. The menu items all sound delicious and I settled for the fish tacos. These are catfish tacos with avocado, cole slaw, and chipotle aioli. They came with some recooked beans and rice with veggies. It looked like quite the spread and I started off tackling the beans and rice. After a few minutes of eating, I went to pick up a taco and noticed a long, straggly, black hair wedged deep into the middle of my taco. I was horrified. It couldn't have been mine because it was so deeply embedded into the taco. I told the waitress and she apologized and offered to bring me a new dish. I chose to have another plate of fish tacos , which was hair free. The tacos were delicious and I was pleasantly surprised when I was offered a complimentary flan as an apology. That definitely soothed my disgust. I'm glad they were just as horrified as I was The food at La Contenta is delicious and worth a visit if you don't mind tight spacing!"
3140,"Overall rating: 5/5My friend never tried hot pot before so we decided to go here! I've been to all locations a few times, but its been a hot minute. So it was nice to go back :)Food: Ugh, we love a winter meal with steaming hot pot! And its AYCE!! My go-to spot forever for hot pot on days like this. Especially gatherings with friends too. There's so many options - you can choose from hot pot and/or kbbq (this is just a tad more expensive). We get to choose the soup base and curate our own mix of sauces at the station (they have two - one on each floor). Due to COVID, they had us order on our phones now and they would bring it to you instead of having the servers take our orders.Ambience: This location has two floors and its super spacious. To my surprise, there were so many people on a weekday! Granted it was MLK, but we were seated on the second floor and I like how it was less crowded.Price: For about $30 a person, I'd say it definitely is worth the amount of food that you get (if you can stomach all the food ofc). They charge you for leftovers but I haven't had that happen. It definitely used to be cheaper but inflation and covid happened. I'll leave it there hahaha.Service: They were accommodating - answered our questions and allowed us to go to the second floor where each of us have individual pots. Service was decent as it was pretty much a full house."
3141,"I wasn't aware it was a three day window and was told from a friend that it was a week. I should've asked to double check but still made a reservation for 7 people. When we arrived, they sat us at a table and I showed them my ID and they returned back saying oh this is the fourth day so you can't do the birthday. Fine - but at any other restaurants if you have good customer service and do a one time courtesy - that wouldn't hurt at all. I genuinely didn't know it was a 3 day window and was misinformed. I only missed it by one day and they still wouldn't allow me to do the birthday deal. Whatever so we still ate hot pot and bbq.Hot pot was alright but the service of bringing our food was awfully slow. The Bbq was not good at all. Low quality food items and also the service was the worst. No servers came by our table to change the grill while it was basically all burnt and no servers came to check up on us to see if we needed help with anything. Everything seemed so rushed and when we left, the servers out front just stood and didn't say anything when we all said ""thank you"". Super unpleasant service and I probably wouldn't come here again even for a birthday meal."
3142,"Overall 3/5: Not my favorite hot pot or kbbq experience. They offered both, and it was sub par for both. Food 3/5: The broth was not the best. I got the spicy, and it just tasted like medicine. I strongly dislike when broths taste like such. We couldn't tell what meat was for which. Service 3/5: We weren't greeted after a while and it would've been helpful to explain how everything was run. They had a QR code through which you order your food. We figured it out, but then when we ordered our broths, he came back and told us we had to do individual pots instead of the shared with two flavors, which would've been helpful to know if anyone had explained anything to us. Our server also spilled water on my friend to which he apologized, but then said he shouldn't leave his water there. You should honestly never say that. We couldn't tell which meat was for the grill or which was for the broth. Once everything was dropped on the table that was that, we had no idea what was on the table. Could've been a better experience if we hadn't been such a large group I assume. Hopefully was just a combination of an off night as well as a large party. Would definitely try it again if i was in a smaller group. Vibe 4/5: Very cool spot. It was clean and nicely decorated. We heard happy birthday like seven times, which brings me to my next point. The server brought us the wrong cake to our table. It was for a nearby table, which considering how many birthdays there were that night you would double check. The host told me which number our cake would be but our server never asked for it, which resulted in us receiving another tables cake. Thank you, 99 Favor."
3143,"definitely try favor  99. It's all you can eat buffet and Korean barbecue for under $40. Definitely come get hungry and try the selection of meat and vegetables. The wait staff were courteous and they have QR code set up so that you can scan and order at your leisure. The Korean barbecue staff were attentive and they provided drinks throughout.my girlfriend and I tried two different hot pots - they come singularly or together if you want multiple flavors. For the barbecue I definitely recommend jumbo shrimp and steak. Overall the ambience was fairly OK, nothing to write home about. That location was in the heart of Chinatown and make sure you make reservations or arrive really, really early because the wait after 6 PM was over an hour and a half. Also if you come on your birthday the day of or two days before two days or after, they provide free dining for one person."
3144,"99 Favor Taste is again the winner and undisputed hot pot champion. Having been to the location in Flushing, stopped by the one downtown today. It was crowded but we got a table for lunch quickly on a Saturday afternoon at 1ish. The restaurant is enormous. Very good vibe. Nice music playing and a lot of families and groups of city-folk alike. The hot pot is like $29 and we certainly ate our fill. Ordering is simple!  They put a QR code on your table and you get to place your order (and re-order, and re-re-order) yourself from your phone. It was really an enjoyable experience. The broths were very good. Frankie had the original and I had the Szechuan spicy. I didn't specify level of spice but what they gave me was about right. The pork really did get honorable mention. But everything was very good."
3145,"Came here for all you can eat. Service was mediocre since it was so busy. Some of the food that we ordered never came and when asked about it, they said it was on its way... but didn't come at the end. And sometimes the food we order they would give us extra we didn't order. Say one order of udon, they gave us three orders of. Also I found it annoying that they would play the happy birthday song so loudly. Probably heard it 8x. Also future patrons, make sure you do your own due diligence and tip calculations accordingly. Just know that the ""tip suggestions"" the restaurant provides on the check is based off the total post-tax amount. (Basically you're playing extra tip on taxes). In my opinion, the tip suggestions should be based on the pre tax amount on the bill, not the total, since tax is not a service that the restaurant provided."
3146,"Hot pot was thankfully not a victim of the Covid rethinking away from big shared communal meals (sub par all you can eat buffets however should be cosigned to the dustbins of history, global pandemic or not)99 Flavor gives you two options - hot pot or Korean BBQ, and both are all you can eat options. We did the Hot Pot on an appropriately freezing winters night. Rather than have waiters come around with menus and continually ask what types of add ins you want for your pot, the entire ordering process is done on a tablet - an introverts dream! The selection of options is expansive with different meat, fish and veggie options to choose from along with multiple types of noodles and other things to build up the pot (the fried dough for example - good in theory, sub par in execution). In addition to the things to go in the pot, 99 Flavor offers a huge row of sauces, vinegars and oils to take back to your table and really jazz up your boilings. The one thing I find different about 99 Flavor as compared to other hot pot places is that they don't give you any opportunity to get at the broth you've been making the entire meal. While other places give you bowls and spoons to ladle out all that flavory goodness, 99 Flavor only gives you plates and a slotted spoon - almost like they want all the broth to stay in the pot!!"
3147,"We've been going to 99 Favor for a long time and sadly, the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the restaurant has greatly deteriorated. Here's a summary of our hotpot experience this weekend:1. We ordered our food via the QR code on each table. While this contactless process may be seamless, the items served to us were inaccurate and incomplete. Some of the noodles didn't arrive, the veggies were incomplete, and the meat/protein portions were noticeably smaller in size. We had to put in another round of orders because of this. 2. The ""clean bowls and plates"" at the sauce bar were not clean! I saw cilantro leaves stuck in between plates and the sauce bowls had brownish water droplets dripping from them. I had to do a double take if the bowls and plates I got were used or clean because they didn't look like the latter. 3. We saw a bucket of grayish water with a dirty rag in the middle of the dining area. Good thing our table was far from this nuisance but I thought it was unsanitary and downright gross to see this while slurping your soup. 4. The floors were slippery and felt strangely greasy on my shoes. Wonder how often they clean and mop them. Make sure you're wearing shoes or sneakers with good grip. 5. Service was pretty slow and it did not feel like the waiters were very attentive. We went in for dinner at 4pm so the place wasn't that busy. We had to call their attention to ask for additional orders or water. Not once did anyone approach us to ask if we needed anything, I thought that wasn't the case in the previous years. 6. If you've reached this far, I think there's no need to describe how the ladies room looks like. Maybe the pandemic changed their standards and/or portion sizes but the cleanliness of the restaurant was non-negotiable. I can't imagine how their kitchen looks like and frankly, I don't want to know. I wish the management would make the appropriate changes and improvements because this used to be one of our go-to places in Chinatown. Needless to say, we weren't very satisfied with our hotpot dinner and we probably won't be going back there anytime soon."
3148,"I made a review earlier how it's a great place and decent value for hotpot in Manhattan, but I would say that's only true for parties under 6 people. I went for a birthday of around ~15 people, and it was truly such chaos. They shoved us all into a cramped room that was made for 8 people and barely remembered to come provide service because we were in the corner on the second floor. The food still tasted good but the service was absolutely horrible for a big group like us. When we arrived the room wasn't even ready for like 15 minutes. I don't recommend coming here for a celebration or big group, but it's fine for anything that's a more reasonable size (4-6)."
3149,"My friends and I had such a fun night here! They offer Korean bbq style or hotpot, but we all elected to do hotpot. Once you sit at your table you do all the ordering through their site online and it makes it super convenient, especially when you want to add stuff to your order later on. They also have a sauce making bar for you to whip up your own dipping concoction. It took multiple attempts of experimenting to get the right sauce but it was so fun to play around with what they had. We ordered a ton of meats and vegetables for the five of us and tried our best to finish it because we were concerned there might be a fee for what you don't eat, however I don't think they charge for that because we didn't get a charge. We spent a good two hours here just eating, drinking, laughing, and all around making good memories. It ended up being one of our more memorable meals during our trip to New York. We left feeling extremely full but it made it worth the price. In my opinion the price is very reasonable for all you can eat in comparison to some other all you can eat hotpot places. I will say that traversing back to the subway after our meal felt a little bit sketchy as Chinatown at night is not the most safe feeling place. I also heard that if it's your birthday, they give you your meal for free! You just have to show an ID for proof."
3150,"All I can say is WOW WOW WOW!! Absolutely loved this place , I crave the lobster roll! I found this place after searching for some food after visiting Statue of Liberty , it was a quick 5-7 min walk! Lobster roll is a must !! It is expensive but 100% worth it, then again it's New York and lobster ! Clam chowder was delicious as well!They also had Mexican cola that was strange to me at first but taste exactly like coke! Tables inside are limited , when we got there , there was no line ! 100/10 highly recommend ! Can't wait to go back!"
3151,"I'm going to admit that I wasn't looking forward to eating here. It was our last night in NYC and I had hoped to have dinner in Chinatown. My daughter and her boyfriend had stopped here themselves, loved it and really wanted to treat the entire family. So, OK...They loved the trio of lobster, shrimp and crab half rolls. I went with the large lobster roll. My gosh, it was easily the best I've ever had. The lobster was incredibly fresh. I appreciated that they didn't dress it in a lot of sauce, and the flavor shined through. One bite and I became instantly thankful we ate here."
3152,"After visiting the Statue of Liberty, I searched for a place to grab a late light lunch at 2:30 pm and found Luke's Lobster FiDi. BF and I shared two things:* 4 oz original lobster roll ($23)* 8 oz cup of clam chowder ($7)A bag of chips is included with the lobster roll order. The lobster itself comes chilled, is lightly seasoned in sauce, and is served on a toasted bun. Satisfying, but not a heavy kind of full.We got the 8 oz cup of clam chowder, but you can also get a larger size for $3 more. Their chowder has a decent ratio of clams to potato and the consistency is not too watery yet not too thick. Also a solid choice for a light bite.We didn't notice this until we got our receipt, but they do charge a $0.05 fee for a paper bag and it wasn't a choice of whether we wanted to skip the bag. At least it was for a paper, and not plastic, bag."
3153,"No need to order the extra crab, because the base roll comes with a very good amount of seafood! The lobster roll in the pic is the regular, and the crab roll is the extra, and I really did not need to order the bigger one. The bread was delicious too!!!"
3154,"REALLY scrumptious lobster roll!! I tried the new lobster roll flight- it comes with a side (chips) and 3 mini sized lobster rolls, with 3 different sauces (truffle butter, original butter, and spicy honey butter). The lobster was fresh, and very flavored (even without the butter on it). The sauces were all tasty, and if I HAD to I would pick the truffle butter as my favorite (all were amazing).  Really delicious, and I would return, but not too often because $36 for that meal (6 oz of lobster) is a bit overpriced."
3155,"Location is great, right in the heart of downtown and away from most tourist places. Service was fast. There were self serve water and clean restroom. We got two lobster rolls.... The lobsters absolutely taste fresh - no doubt but for the price, I'm not sure if it's justifiable. We paid $80 for two lobster rolls and a lobster Mac and cheese (was bland overall). Consider other lobster roll locations."
3156,THE BEST! Amazing and friendly service with super fresh lobster. I've never had a lobster roll so good! The clam chowder was bomb too. Shoutout to Kevin for great service! Much appreciated! If I'm ever in the city again I will be back!
3157,"Luke's Lobster not only had delicious food, but a very welcoming and warm staff. We tried the trio which included the crap, shrimp, and lobster roll. The crab was bred up being our favorite. Highly recommend"
3158,"Luke's Lobster serves extremely good lobster rolls for a reasonable price. A 4oz roll with chips is 23 dollars. It should fill up a decent amount but to really get full, i would also recommend a small clam chowder to go with it. The lobster roll is great because it's really meaty and juicy. It has some italian herb taste to it to really bring out the lobster.Highly recommend"
3159,Such a great find and first stop at our trip to NY. Came across this as we headed out and the lobster rolls were so fresh and filling!  So much lobster in on roll!
3160,I come here for the grilled lobster cheese sandwich and usually end up having a beer as well. It is a treat and the people are friendly and the space is clean.
3161,"The prices are fabulous, local seafood, great staff, fabulous food - I would HIGHLY recommend. The lobster roll was toasted ... and it was excellent - mouth watering ... go back every day you can - it was that good."
3162,"We decided to give Luke's a go today. We ordered the lobster Mac ($12) and the combo with soup, roll and drink. I ordered the 4oz lobster roll with up charge for spicy butter on the roll and the crab bisque. The roll had huge chunks of lobster on the roll which looked like a hot dog bun at first. However, you can tell that it was toasted prior to delivery and was much more substantial than a hot dog bun. It offered a slightly sweet complement to the spicy garlic butter. Delicious! The crab bisque was something different entirely. Not creamy- more grainy in texture (like a baby food consistently) but tasted nicely of crab. No real discernible pieces of crab in the bisque which was fine, but an off-putting texture. Perhaps if it was hot, it would have been different. Such is life when we order food via delivery. Regardless, it arrived quickly and was packaged nicely. I would give them another shot for sure!!"
3163,First time I ever tried lobster roll before!  The lobster was really juicy and the chowder was pretty good.  I wonder if I could have asked for it hot since I usually prefer my crustacean warm.   Came out fast and the service was great!
3164,"Today (4/21/21)  I arrived about 15MIN before close...now listen, I understand as an employee when customer comes in close to closing time, one might want to feel rushed service, but....at least warm up the sandwiches and bread.I ordered 2 6OZ lobster roll combos. Once I got home and bit into the roll, I realized it was ice cold. I thought maybe the short walk home caused the meals to cool, but it was ice cold. I also asked for (1) side of butter, which was forgotten. I've always had warm-to-heated buttery sandwiches. Neither the bread nor lobster had any butter. I ended up heating the sandwiches for close to a minute.I'm disappointed with tonight's visit...it felt rushed and the sandwiches were ICE cold."
3165,"Finally got a chance to try this during a less busy lunch time. I have to say they really deserve their popularity. Fairly expensive at $23 for a 4oz roll with chips, but the quality is extremely high. The bun is crispy outside and fluffy inside, with a good amount of butter. The lobster is so well seasoned, fresh and moist with the lemon and mayo mix. Interesting that they have a bottle of sriracha sauce on every table, but indeed a few drop of them changed the flavours of the lobster roll to a more spicy and asian version. I did that on a few bites and kept the original for the rest and it felt like a double experience from a single roll. The chips went well with the roll and the allagash white beer completed the experience. I would rate this higher than a lot of lobster rolls that I got in Boston or Maine. Highly recommended."
3166,"Weekend's the perfect time to come, it's dead. Got a lobster roll and a crab roll. Both were delish. Meat was good quality, on par with rolls in Maine. Felt the price was reasonable, too."
3167,"Pretty straightforward when it comes down to the Lobster Rolls and Lobster Grilled Cheese - tasty bread, butter, and quality lobster!Giving this three stars instead of four because it wasn't a roll I'd go out of my way for."
3168,Bens lobster rolls are the real deal and the Maine Local flavor from the drink to the Food are right on point. Shrimp roll also worth trying if your budget is tight. Delicious. Been a fan since the day they opened.
3169,"Best lobster roll I've ever had. Love how fresh the lobster was and how simple yet tasty the seasoning was, really let the lobster shine. The butter roll was the perfect compliment to the lobster as well. I've had other lobster rolls that are good as well but a bit overly decadent so that by the last bite you're a little over it. Not with this! It's perfect all around! I got the 4 oz. which was perfect. If you are especially hungry or know you tend towards larger servings I'd go for the 6 oz. The guy at the counter was also super friendly!"
3170,"Very high quality.  A bit pricey for every day lunches, but for a treat...it's definitely worth it.  The food is rich so large portions would be silly.The bisque and small roll were fantastic.They also have a punch card program to take the bite off of the price.Happy National Lobster Day!"
3171,Good tasting lobster rolls but overpriced for the amount of lobster and we got the 6 oz version.
3172,"Price a bit high but it's shellfish and just off Wall Street. Surprisingly, the crab roll was better than the lobster, shrimp was just okay. Giving 5 stars for the blueberry soda and that it's a shellfish joint located where North America's first synagogue was, for the irony not the disrespect."
3173,Super delicious and fast friendly service! Great way to get fresh seafood with a NYC twist!
3174,"Expensive, but super good! I got the 4oz lobster roll with lobster Mac & Cheese. I should've ordered the 6oz."
3175,"One of my fav spots for tasty seafood The food was tasty.The staff are super friendly and very helpful. You wanna know about food, right, food is excellent and service is always extremely friendly. Awesome happy hour prices"
3176,"Womp womp. I was disappointed by these pretty rolls! They looked great, especially the lobster with truffle, but it was just mediocre. I'm not sure why they serve the meat ice cold...? The lobster meat just didn't have much flavor, I liked the crab roll better. We walked so far to eat here and it was just disappointing  The Soup Man's lobster roll was 10 times better!"
3177,"We were really hungry and found this place nearby. I can always go for lobster rolls so the timing was perfect. You can either order at the counter or through the QR code posted in the shop. I got the 4oz lobster roll and my bf got the 6oz which was $8 more. Our food didn't take too long to come out, but we were surprised at how small the rolls were. The lobster was juicy, sweet, and tasted pretty fresh. It was stuffed into a crispy buttery bun. It's not the typical sweet bun I was used to, but was a nice change. Even though the rolls were small, it was a good amount to eat if you aren't too hungry."
3178,"My bf put me on to this place. Best lobster roll in nyc, maybe best ever. Try for yourself lol"
3179,Kind of pricey (as expected with lobster) but fckng delicious. The lobster is flavorful but fresh/clean tasting (not overly seasoned) and *chef's kiss* on the buttered roll. Staff was also really nice.
3180,"The best lobster roll I have had. The crab bisque was fantastic as well. They have a variety of interesting sodas, including a blueberry soda that hit the spot. Friendly staff."
3181,Great lobster roll but i have to admit it was my first.  The Lobster was not over cooked.  The bun was sweet and soft. No Mayo but I think it would have been better with some mayonnaise.   Maybe that is something that is not part of a lobster roll.  Good price especially for the amount of lobster on the bun.  Beer was good and cold.  I would definitely go again.  Small place but quick service.
3182,"I stopped in for a 4 oz. lobster roll with coleslaw and a drink. For drinks they let you choose anything in the fridge so I chose a bottle of the Maine Blueberry Lemonade with Wildflower Honey. The young man behind the register was really nice and friendly. The bun was toasted and buttery and the lobster pieces were big and plump. The coleslaw was based on a poppyseed vinaigrette type dressing, not mayo, so it was refreshing and flavorful and provided a nice crunch to go with the lobster roll. They also give you a free pickle if you ask for it."
3183,I absolutely love Luke's. My go to is the trio and I would recommend any of their rolls.  The staff is super friendly and pleasant which is a plus!
3184,Hands down the best lobster roll I've had!! They do not skimp out on the lobster. Fresh and delicious! We tried the original lobster roll and the truffle butter one. Both great! I didn't enjoy the clam chowder soup though. Also service is great- the man who took our order was very helpful and kind.
3185,"I was told that I would never find a good gluten free lobster roll. My life waa ruined. I was in despair for years until a rainy spring day in New York we come upon Luke's Lobster.Sustainable lobster, great intimate atmosphere and amazing friendly service.The roll itself was comparable to the ones I have had in Maine. The lobster was fresh and cool in contrast with the warm toasty buttery roll. 10/10"
3186,"The thing that shines at this place is the service. Who says that New Yorkers are rude?! I think this place proves that it's actually the opposite. They obviously care about the customer. I got the trio sampler which had half a sandwich of the lobster roll, crab roll, and shrimp roll. I also ordered the lobster bisque with the meal. I can say that EVERYTHING tasted wonderful! Now, my only gripe is with the obvious that this is a pricey meal for what you actually get. All lobster rolls in general are super expensive, I know this. However, I can say that with all the lobster rolls I've had in my life, this was the smallest I've had (I'm judging this based off of my friend's full lobster roll size). I get that this establishment serves lobster (which is already expensive) and that they're operating in one of the most expensive cities in the world. However, I've had many lobster rolls all over the city and this one is still the smallest portion at the highest price. Again, this is only a small gripe. I would come back mainly for the convenience and the service."
3187,"Cuisine: 8Service: 7Decor: 7Value: 8Overall: 8Butter and herb/spice blend rather than mayo, that is the secret to the success of this chain of seafood shacks that specializes in lobster rolls. However, it's in the details, like the soft pillowy buttered brioche bread and perfectly cooked lobster that takes this experience to another level.Compared to most lobster rolls, this is just a much lighter and cleaner tasting. The pure flavors of lobster shines through without being masked by any real sauce. We all know that butter is the best accompaniment for any crustacean, so that's what Luke's gave us.On this day, we had ordered catering from them, one giant box of mini lobster rolls and another box of mini crab rolls. They are like ""crave case"" from White Castles but carrying more precious contents. Not to be outdone, the crab rolls are equally as pure and delicious. Also, it traveled really well, losing almost nothing except the warmth of the bread.If you prefer mayo in your lobster roll, go to Pearl Oyster Bar.  On the other hand, a light refreshing version is what you prefer, then go to Luke's. Have it for lunch, a quick snack, or yummy dinner, have it anytime and it'll always be fantastic."
3188,Do yourself a favor. Get the 6oz truffle butter lobster roll and thank me later. Perfect lunch for a gorgeous day.
3189,"Fuck yeah! This food is so  good, I know it could be a little expensive (lobster)... but it's really good. I had a pick up order... I couldn't say much about the place and service."
3190,"I got a lobster roll here and it was delicious. I wish it was a bit bigger for the price paid. I used to get lobster rolls a lot in Boston when I was living there, and this is comparable to the famous lobster roll in Boston. I also tried their shrimp roll, it's good but not as good as I expected because I don't like the taste of shrimp. I felt like the shrimp could be cooked a little more. However, the taste and flavor were mouth watery and a quick place to grab a bite and go. Definitely recommend esp now there are seats by seaport to enjoy the food"
3191,"Came here for some take out food. I'm not a huge fan of lobster, so I had the crab roll and the side of clam chowder. The clam chowder was AMAZING. Very flavorful and not salty. It was kind of small, but I was surprised that after I finished drinking it, I was full without even eating my jumbo crab roll. The jumbo crab roll was a bit small, I thought. Imagine a regular hot dog roll, but buttered and HEAPING with crab meat (I got the jumbo after all). The crab was definitely fresh, but I think it could use just a bit more seasoning. The bread was good, but nothing to call home about. Overall, a pretty good crab roll. They apparently have happy hour also. But just note that this place is pretty small. So I'm not sure how packed it gets at that time. It was pretty packed at lunch time. Seems like a good deal though if you can make it for happy hour."
3192,"I told my boyfriend I liked the lobster roll more than him. I told him I was joking, but hmmm was I? We were in the Financial District and this was the #1 recommended spot in the area so we decided to give it a try. Upon entering, we were welcomed by a nice, friendly worker who would later on, personally deliver our orders. We both had the Lobster Roll ($17) although I actually wish I had Luke's Trio instead just so I am able to sample all 3 lobster, crab, and shrimp. Either way, the lobster roll was absolutely delicious! The roll was unfortunately tiny but I could definitely see the craftsmanship in it with the fresh lobster, buttered bread, seasoning, and dash of that lemon. Even though the roll was expensive, it's fresh seafood and it was filling! They also offer free water inside the drinks fridge. I definitely recommend this place if you have the money to splurge or just want to try some quick quality seafood!"
3193,Today I went into Luke's lobster to order a 6 lobster roll.......1hr and 15 mins later I walked to the register to find out about my order....my order was never submitted to the cooks. I've never been so upset in my life
3194,"My friend and I checked out Luke's Lobster around 1:30pm on a Friday.  Like many FiDi restaurants, Luke's is more of a grab-and-go place, but there is seating for about 6-7 small parties.  When we arrived, it was full.  However, one of the workers told us the turnaround was quick, and we were able to get seats within 5 minutes of getting our food.My friend got the lobster roll combo #2 ($25) which came with soup and a drink.  I got the lobster grilled cheese (seasonal-winter)($13) with a small side of soup ($7).  We both got clam chowder for the soup.  This is a simple, no frills chowder that could have been Progresso's.  There was no distinct briny/fresh taste of the clams and there was nothing distinctive about the ingredients.  The lobster roll is tiny and fits in a 5 in x 7 in serving tray.  My friend and I both thought the lobster was tasty, and we also prefer the simplicity of the roll and that it's not slathered with mayo.  I would recommend the grilled cheese over the roll since it's more filling.Keeping in mind that the food is sourced from Maine, it's in the FiDi, and it's lobster, I can see why the price might be steeper than normal.  However, I'm not willing to shell out $25 for a meal that isn't filling.  To me, Luke's is overpriced across the board.  The clam chowder is actually the biggest rip off though, since a can of supermarket clam chowder is comparable and goes for half the price.  If you must try a lobster roll, I would recommend getting it without the combo ($19 alone) and plan to fill up on other food elsewhere."
3195,"I had the best lobster roll I've ever had here!! Unlike most lobster rolls, the lobster roll I got here was filled with lots of tender lobster meat. The price of the lobster roll is worth it here! (Other lobster rolls I've had were more expensive with less lobster meat). The roll itself was buttered and crispy and not soggy at all. I ordered the winter special lobster Mac and cheese as well and was not disappointed at all. The flavor of the Mac and cheese was great and had a lot of lobster meat as well. I highly recommend Luke's Lobster to seafood lovers!"
3196,The butter lobster rolls are outstanding just wish they were bigger because they're quite pricey. But the seafood is always fresh and if there's anything ever wrong with your order (which is rare) customer service is great.
3197,"One of my fav spots for tasty seafood. The food was tasty.I arrived late in the afternoon, so there were only a few people inside.  It's a  neat and clean place.I should have read the reviews first and stuck to lobster. I had salad with boiled shrimp."
3198,"The food is tasty, the staff are friendly and a bit cheeky, and the portions are a bit small for the price unless you order ""jumbo"". The blueberry soda goes well with the lobster. I had the lobster roll and lobster bisque.  I spend $30 sans tip and left hungry."
3199,"Lord have mercy let me tell you!! This spot is IT! We ordered the lobster roll and lobster mac and cheese, I have no words. So good! Amazing! The best! It's small inside but we got a seat still. Customer service was top notch, obviously these people love their job because it showed clearly to us. I wish I lived in NY because I would eat there several times a week. So good!! Must try!"
3200,"Almost just as good as the lobtah roll I had in Maine the previous week. I loved the buttery, savory roll with the cold beer on happy hour special. I found the prices to be super reasonable and everyone who works there to be super friendly. Can't wait to make a return trip down here."
3201,"After visiting near the Statue of Liberty, we found Luke's to indulge in some Lobster! The service was prompt and all staff were polite. It is a smaller space maybe 20 people maximum, but wasn't too crowded when we were there. My boyfriend ordered a lobster roll ($16) and I ordered the lobster grilled cheese ($13). We shared an order of Large Lobster Corn Chowder ($10). Overall, it was very tasty! The lobster roll looked larger in pictures than in real life and without the side of soup, my boyfriend would have left hungry. I left full and he left satisfied. I was satisfied with how much lobster was in my grilled cheese and would recommend it! The soup was a great addition on a chilly day, plus I loved dipping my grilled cheese into it!"
3202,"While visiting Brooklyn, this was one of my spots I really wanted to try out. Being from the west coast, I thought this place would really nail it for east coast style lobster roll and etc. Closer to Maine than I am, right?My fiancè and I ordered the the sampler which came with a lobster roll, shrimp roll, and crab roll with a side of lobster mac n cheese and clam chowder. The rolls themselves were quite delicious. However, the seafood didn't really hit the spot for me. The lobster was the star of the rolls but the shrimp roll was a bit hard to get down. It definitely wasn't our favorite. The clam chowder was good considering that was the first thing we actually completely finished. The lobster mac was my favorite even more than the rolls but overall, everything was just decent. Nothing to rave about. I will say that the 3 stars i'm giving weren't just because of the food. We arrived around 5:30 in the evening and there was only one other group of customers already seated and eating at the time so it wasn't busy at all. However, it took almost a little over 45 minutes for us to get our food and after walking around Brooklyn all day, we weren't too happy about that. Our server was kind and kept telling us it was taking that long because of the lobster mac, which we understood after the first 15 minutes of waiting. But after 30 minutes and then 45? We may have just came on an off day or something.If you try this place out, I hope you end up enjoying it more than we did!"
3203,"After spending the morning biking around Governor's Island, Luke's Lobster is a short walk from the pier.It's a small space with tables in the middle, sides and (blessed) seats for the solo diners on the side too.I decided on giving their trio a try just to sample a bit of everything. Splurged on the meal (grab a drink from the fridge and a pack of chips from near the register).Got a Luke's blueberry lemonade. Wow. I must drink too many sugary drinks because this was really tart but I guess that makes it healthy?Luke's trio consists of mini rolls of mini shrimp, crab meat and lobster. I really appreciate how they write where they source their seafood from (Massachusetts!). The shrimp roll was pass-able. The crab meat one was pretty okay but the star is definitely the lobster roll! I love their rendition of it; just simple fresh tasty lobster meat. I think that really allows the lobster flavor to shine through cuz lobster doesn't really any sauces or whatnot to help enhance it's flavor.Appreciative of the napkins and bathroom (gotta wash the hands) that are here too!"
3204,"Walked right in, no line but we took long to decide what to order  ended up with the 7oz lobster roll combo - chips and bottled drink.  Super delicious lobster roll and I had half a crab roll which was also delicious!  We met one of founders, Ben and had a little conversation about best places to eat in New York!  Awesome service and yummy seafood rolls!"
3205,"It's your typical Luke's Lobster, but in this case my boyfriend and I took our shrimp rolls and potato chips to go and ate them on Governor's Island. (The lobster rolls are great too, but I actually prefer the shrimp). Best decision ever."
3206,"Believe it or not, the first place I tried Luke's Lobster was in Japan. I loved it so much that I had to try this place in the birthplace of Luke's Lobster next time I was in NYC...which was just recently!It was quiet at 11:30am as they just opened, and also the place was COLD. It was somewhat of a hot day, but not too overwhelming to the point where the A/C needed to be blasted.I had the lobster roll with the clam chowder. The lobster roll was definitely amazing, even better than the one I had in Japan. Large chunks of lobster and the sauce was great too. The clam chowder was a bit diluted, yet salty at the same time. I'd probably pass on this next time, at least for this branch. However, I came for the lobster roll, and the main event easily met my expectations, so it's a 4-star for me.I didn't get much in terms of service since you order from the counter and that was it. Either way Luke's definitely is a yes for me for lobster rolls in NYC."
3207,"-FoodUhhh, I mean it's good. I got a lobster roll and the lobster is amazing. Very fresh. I didn't expect to have this quality of lobster in NYC. It was also very impressive that without making it just too sweet or salty, it was perfectly seasoned. -PriceWelp. This is why it's not 5 stars. I thought it was definitely over-priced even considering the fact that it is lobster and it is in NYC. I've had other lobster rolls of similar quality in the city and other places at a much, much lower price. I didn't think there was anything too special about this particular roll that would compensate for the price. -OverallI wouldn't go back for the roll. It's worth a try but not to go for regular basis."
3208,"Pricey yes, but delicious. We ordered the lobster roll and crab roll for $17 and $13. They arrived packed with luscious seafood. The bun was toasted and crunchy and the butter, oh so good. We enjoyed the lobster roll, but found the crab one slightly salty. We wish we could taste more of the natural seafood flavour (they didn't have much flavour or sweetness other than the butter and touch of herbs). Nonetheless, they were pretty dang good."
3209,"Buttery, juicy, and flavorful. They toast the bread so it's crispy, but never burnt. Perfection but slightly overpriced. Blame the location for that. Thankfully, for every 10 lobster rolls you buy you get 1 free. You'll hit 10 faster than you think; I'm salivating thinking about those lobsters right now."
3210,Luke's Lobster FiDi is extraordinary. Flavorful menu items and outstanding service. Every single thing that we ordered was incredibly fresh and delicious. All of the staff are extremely pleasant - you most certainly feel welcome and looked after. I will recommend Luke's Lobster FiDi to all my friends.
3211,The trio!! $20 for this delicious thing. Shrimp. Crab. Lobster. Only half a hot dog each though. But still so good. Butter drenched on it. There's Siracha sauce and pepper for you to toss on it also for added flavor. This stuff is good. Seriously it's good. Just expensive. But a wonderful experience. It was really smoky inside though. Not sure if the ventilation was working adequately but the delicious food makes up for the smoke. Great food. So delicious. Fresh.
3212,I just need some Luke's Lobster Rolls once in a while. It's such a classic and it's so consistently good every time no matter which shop I go to.
3213,LOVE this place!! Delicious lobster roll and lobster bisque! Well worth it! They definitely give lots of lobster and are not shy in their portions. Great place!
3214,Yummmm my first time and loved it! I love the buttery toasty bread that it uses. We got the trio and I think that's the best option! I like the shrimps and lobster the most!! Crab was alright because it was not as flavorful. Just somehow....soggy and crabby. It's good but not as good as the other two! Our order man was very friendly. It was during happy hour but we ordered to go so didn't take advantage of that.
3215,Eh it's ok. Most of these places taste almost exactly the same with the only difference being between the cost or portion size. I came here a couple of weeks ago because I wanted a lobster roll and was disappointed spending around $60 and still hungry afterwards.
3216,"So good! After touring the Statue of Liberty, we jumped to our maps app to find a place for lunch and this place stood out to us. Thank goodness it did! The food was absolutely wonderful and the service was excellent. The guys working were all so friendly and attentive. I had the lobster roll and lobster bisque combo with a root beer. It was all so delicious. The lobster roll is essentially a piece of Texas toast folded in half with the tastiest, lightly seasoned lobster chunks inside. The bisque was light and full of flavor. We were so happy we chose to come here!"
3217,"Can I just start be saying how wonderful it is to place orders through the Yelp app? Thank you, Luke Lobster, for making that happen!I don't get to the east coast often, but when I do, seafood is always on the menu! Luke's Lobster did not disappoint.Ordered their trademark lobster roll with some cole slaw on the side. The lobster was fresh, perfectly chilled, and topped with their tasty seasoning. Really appreciated the reasonable serving size of their ""standard size"". I've had lobster rolls at other places in New England and those other places often make their rolls too big.The ""standard"" roll was about the size of a hotdog bun and chock full of lobster. Loved it. The cole slaw was crispy and tangy, really good.Beware that this place is a bit pricey, as is everything in NYC."
3218,What a great restaurant!  I hear great things about Luke's Lobster FiDi and it exceeded my expectations! All I can say is YUMMMM! Great personal service. The service was good and I would definitely go back.
3219,What an amazing experience! The team working at this Luke's Lobster location is exceptional! Everyone is super nice and attentive. The food is delicious. Highly recommend. Thank you!
3220,"Upon walking in, I was a little confused because it didn't look like a coffee shop or bakery at all. A very mom and pop looking shop that doesn't focus on aesthetics. But while you're in here, you will immediately see how popular this place is with locals! I got a couple of the sponge cakes to try and they were pretty good and not too sweet. Not the best sponge cake I've had in my life but I liked how they have different flavors. Their drinks are the best part. The Vietnamese coffee wasn't too sweet. Their Hong Kong milk tea is probably the best one I've had! I definitely recommend the drinks."
3221,"Great sponge cakes, but make sure to come early. I was here around 2:30pm on a Saturday and the only flavors left were pandan and original. Hopefully next time I get to try the others."
3222,I've also tried their original and pineapple. Both good as well! Looking forward to trying other flavors whenever I'm nearby
3223,"Super nice and friendly! They were willing to help out and their prices were so cheap! My grandparents, parents, and now I have been going to this bakery for generations and we are never disappointed. I haven't had single thing on the menu that I did not enjoy.Their service is also really quick! Even with the place being so busy because of it's fame, the line moves fast to the point that there barely is a line!I also was surprised that they gave me two complimentary hand sanitizer bottles in my order. Thanks so much!!"
3224,"Kam Hing is a no frills coffeeshop, but one could walk right by the entrance and not even know it. there's seating outside, none inside. don't  let the hole-in-the-wall looks fool you as Kam Hing serves up a variety of small baked treats and a variety of caffeinated drinks. the space is well-worn in and kinda of messy but not dirty or anything...just packed with stuff and doesn't look like your typical coffee spot. stopped by a couple of weeks ago and scanned the chalkboard 'menu on the wall. i ended up asking for a Vietnamese Coffee and it did not disappoint. a drinkable  companion makes for refreshing strolls around Chinatown on warm humid days. the iced Vietnamese coffee is not too sweet and has nice caffeine kick. prices are wallet friendly for all the teas and coffees. my iced coffee was $3ish + tip.the service is friendly and quick. drops mic cuz the caffeine kicked ini outzzz"
3225,This is a Chinatown staple and I would recommend it for their bun cakes. They are less then $1 and so yummy!! They also have Vietnamese coffee here which has more caffeine then a regular coffee abs the prices here are much lower. It's not a fancy place but it's awesome nonetheless
3226,"Awesome sponge cakes, 3 for $2 for OG plain.  Perfectly moist and fluffy inside with a touch of chew on the outside.  Perfect with coffee. I should try some of the different flavors but it hardly seems necessary when the regular ones are already perfect.  Popular spot but the line moves quickly."
3227,"My family and I have been coming to this place for sponge cakes for the majority of my life (I'm turning 30 this year) and it's been owned by the same family and being passed down to the next generation. They rotate their flavors daily, but have no problem making a particular flavor if you call a day in advance! The family is so sweet and kind, and wonderful in every possible way. We order 15 Dozen the morning of Labor Day (around 10AM) and picked them up for just after noon - they even called to let us know it would be ready until noon because I think we originally told them we could be there earlier. I've tried the following: Original, Strawberry, Ube, Pandan, Green Tea, Chocolate Chip, Butterscotch, and Black SesameThe OG (Original) is perfection and wonderful. I honestly enjoyed all of them, but nothing can beat out the Original. The Ube and Pandan were very subtle in flavor while I thought the Strawberry and Black Sesame had more of a punch of their flavor. Chocolate Chip and Butterscotch has tiny little pieces of said thing in it and it was still great.Every time I'm in NYC, I want to make sure I always swing by and get some of their Sponge Cakes. I genuinely wished they had a shop in Boston because they're just fluffy, airy, perfection. They really are the definition of a ""mom & pop"" shop, family-owned treasure. Go here. Always go here. Also go to their ""sibling"" shop, Tonii's Fresh Rice Noodles!"
3228,"Funny that there's a Spongies Cafe across the street selling cheaper options. Still stand by Kam Hing's being the best: a consistent stop for delightfully airy spongecakes. The Classic flavor is always an eggy, light treat, but do try their other flavors like Sesame, Ube & Pandan! Their coffee and teas are cheap too; and there are 4 tables for outdoor seating.Credit cards accepted only if over $8.  A+ in my book!"
3229,"Best and cheapest sponge cakes in town - soft, delicious, and heavenly! We got 12 sponge cakes for the very low price of $10 and got to try a bunch of delicious flavors. I'd get all the flavors below again except for maybe the Green Tea--ORIGINAL: Love! Light, airy, melt in your mouth delish.PANDAN: I'm from Southeast Asia, and this tasted like home! Such a beautiful aroma and taste. My only gripe is it was really green and I'm not sure if it's all natural pandan vs. food coloring. The flavor was A++ though, so I'd willingly eat it again.CHOCOLATE CHIP: For any chocolate fans, this is a great light dessert that's full of small pieces of chocolate.COCONUT: Basically same as ORIGINAL, just has some light coconut crunch.UBE: My bf really liked this, I could've skipped it. Like the Pandan, this was quite purple but maybe this is naturally occurring.GREEN TEA: Green tea flavor is strong, I didn't mind it as it tasted like a sweet green tea.SERVICEWe came Saturday around 4pm. All the flavors were still available except for Black Sesame (note the menu placards may not be accurate on what's available vs. out so just check with the cashier). The owner's mom sold us the 12-piece box and she was really sweet and helpful helping us choose popular flavors. Service was super fast, and there are lots of seating inside the store and outside with comfortable chairs. We paid with cash, not sure if they take credit.One small issue we had was when we got outside and opened the box, we couldn't tell which flavor was which. Only Pandan and Ube flavors were distinguishable because they were green and purple; others all looked similar to the Original flavor. So if that matters to you, check with the cashier which flavor corresponds to which sponge cake before you leave.Can't wait to return-- looking forward to trying the other flavors and the Ovaltine and other drinks!"
3230,Service was fast and friendly. The sponge cakes tasted very fresh and fluffy and there were so many delicious flavors to choose from. The Vietnamese iced coffee was really tasty as well and the perfect level of sweetness to go with the cakes.
3231,"Especially delicious! A simple little shop on the first floor. Locals were seated inside of this messy but homey space.The sponge cakes - let's talk. I believe there are daily choices because the menu looked removable for easily changing. I got the cappuccino, butterscotch, and chocolate chip. These little guys are individually wrapped and pulled from underneath the counter. Each of them were perfectly sweet. Not too much but I could taste each of the flavors which I find difficult in other cake like pastries. Don't eat them too fast, they aren't dense upon feel but can leave you feeling full. Fluffy and finger food perfection.The staff was friendly and commutative. I asked what I thought were his favorite and he gave recommendations which I had!I can't wait to return with family and friends when I am in the area! If they cleaned up a little in terms of organizing, I'd give 5 stars!"
3232,"Going to make this short and super sweet like my visit, this place is AMAZING. The cakes are moist, great texture (light and fluffy) and so flavorful, definitely a new favorite desert for me and place to take visitors when exploring Chinatown. No wonder they've been ranked as the best sponge cake in NYC. The staff, additionally, AMAZING! Super friendly and super helpful. Thank you for the butterscotch recommendation, it was my favorite too."
3233,"Holy moly, the sponge cakes here are freaken delicious and everything was just amazing!!!  I love a great sponge cake and the people at Kam Hing certainly know what they're doing.  These people here are the sponge cake kings!  I don't eat sponge cakes often, only because there are no bakeries near me that make them.  Coincidentally, I had a sponge cake from a different local Chinese bakery earlier this week.  It was okay and the taste was just as I expected.  Fast forward to Tuesday of this week, I tried Kam Hing's sponge cakes for the very first time and omg, I was so blown away.  I've never tasted a sponge cake this amazing before.  It was so moist, so fresh and so flavorful.  It shocked me how amazing it was.  I never knew sponge cakes could be this good.I tried the green tea, ube, coconut, butterscotch and chocolate chip.  Every single flavor was amazing.  My faves though were the ube and green tea.  I wish they had the other flavors because I would've bought everything.  I can't wait to come back and try the thai tea, black sesame and lychee rose.  A dozen goes for $10 and I highly recommend getting a dozen or two to share.  You won't regret it.  Make sure you come early because they do sell out.  I tried to come a few times later in the day in the past and everything was sold out =(.  I finally hit the jackpot this week and I was so excited!The gentleman, think he might be the owner's son, was helping me and explaining the different flavors since I was unfamiliar.  He was so patient and nice.  I will definitely be back for more sponge cakes the next time I am in Chinatown.  Thank you for an amazing snack and wonderful service!  Everyone go and support your local mom and pop's."
3234,"Come for the sponge cake, stay for some more sponge cake!  The options of sponge cakes are amazing and a lot. Got the original, cappuccino, and strawberry. Hands down the latest was my favorite. The texture was sublime and taste was great. Loved every bite."
3235,"Pillowy and soft sponge cakes of every flavor!I got a bunch: original, pandan, green tea, Thai tea, sesame, and more that I can't even remember. I will say the original will always have my heart though. The sponge cakes here are ever so slightly more dense actually but are delicious all the same!"
3236,"I'm not sure there's a more perfect snack/dessert in NYC. Love and obsession at first bite. Several mouthfuls later, the ultimate Asian auntie seal of approval comes wonderingly out: ""so good... and Not Too Sweet!"" These sponge cakes are a slamming deal at $8-10/dozen and they're equally delicious whether you get them here or at Tonii's. Pictured is Ube, also had Pandan which brought me back to Singapore and I inhaled the matcha cakes so fast I came back for more. Can't think too much about why I didn't buy several dozen the last time I was in the area or I'll cry from regret. Don't be like me, buy several of every flavor and tip well, everyone's so nice here!The sponge cakes are delicious, customer service is great as well! I had the original (still warm), green tea and coconut, highly recommend it! Will go back, I want to try the ube sponge cake."
3237,"I came down this street by accident on my was to the market, but I am so glad I did. I love Chinese sponge cake and Japanese cheesecake due to its light airy texture and lack of sugariness. And these are probably some of the best sponge cakes I've had ever! The dad at this place was the shining star for customer service, the ladies, not so much. They were friendlier to other customers of other backgrounds but I guess I did not fit the demographic that they felt like being nice to this particular day.The dad helped me select a few flavors and even came around the counter to help figure out what they still had. I went with brown sugar boba, butterscotch,  original and strawberry. Though they were all clouds of lightly flavored deliciousness,   I think it was butterscotch or boba that was my fav (caramel colored dots inside) I couldn't tell which was which.  I wish I git a few more.I will definitely be back, hopefully the ladies are less brash next time."
3238,"These sponge cakes. THESE SPONGE CAKES!!!! You simply cannot understand until you try them. My favorites are the ube, the matcha, and of course the original. The texture is unlike anything else. The people at the counter are helpful, friendly, and efficient."
3239,"The ""best sponge cakes in town"" said the sign. I was like wow, that's ambitious - but then I had my first bite and I knew they weren't lying. For this trip, I got 3 sponge cakes and I can't wait to go back and buy more. Each one is so fluffy and delicious and still tastes fresh 1-2 days after purchase (if you seal it right, probably). ORIGINAL SPONGE CAKE - okay, this one is my favorite one. You can't go wrong with the classic. Light, fluffy, fresh, just amazing all around.BLACK SESAME - this was my least favorite of my three, but if you're a black sesame fan you will probably like it more than me. It was still good though!!!! Just not my top choice. STRAWBERRY - a bit sweeter than the rest, but delicious and fluffy all the same.The service and ambience was great too."
3240,"As FRESH as it gets!I'm always on the hunt for the freshest seafood around, but, in NYC, you either pay triple digits for Michelin or have to visit a seafood market. Not at The Lobster Place--this joint combines the two, both a wholesaler and a restaurant. Across three visits, I've tried the steamed lobster, lobster rolls, a variety of rolls, the uni, and both raw and charbroiled oysters. Everything is super fresh, sweet, and reasonably-priced. No wonder some of the best restaurants in city flock here for stock!"
3241,"Lobster place:Was craving for some lobster roll and couldn't think of any spot more fresh than the lobster place in Chelsea Market. Been meaning to try this spot out but whenever I visit Chelsea Market the place is always pack with tourist and locals. Decided to hop in during a weekday and surprisingly the line wasn't long. Before getting in, they check your vaccine card then they will stamp you. Afterward feel free to either dine on the sushi bar, buy fresh seafood or get in line for your lobster. What we order: 1) 2 lobster roll picnic box: $53.90 with tax came out to $58.69: this included a lobster roll, your choice of soup and a chip. We got the England clam chowder and the lobster bisque. The lobster Roll was very fresh. The soups were tasty. After you pay, you will go to the other side for pick up. Our order came our quick. I would say this meal was good for a snack not as filling but everything was fresh."
3242,"Love this spot located in Chelsea market nyc. Dishing out ( spot is pretty clean, and organized ). The offer Amazing lobster rolls and whole main lobsters as well. The lobster roll is delicious, soft bread, huge pieces of lobster meat and right amount of butter. The huge main lobster is full of meat as well and has great seafood taste. ( both of must try ). The service is always good. Staff is friendly and they treat you like a priority. They asked me If it was my first time visiting, I said yes it is, and at this time the young lady helped me with the menu!! ( she was patient ). My only knock on this place would have to be the wait times and long lines, at certain times you will have to wait for a while due to the demand. But honesty I would wait as long as I have to for a lobster roll! They are that GOOD!!!! Well recommended!!!!!!"
3243,"I always get a couple oysters as a quick stop whenever I'm in Chelsea Market.  It's so fresh!  Oysters are $3 each.  They recommended the Nonesuch Emerald oysters, which we loved. I also thought the Mystic oysters were good too.  It's not the cheapest place for seafood but everything is so good! Definitely want to try the lobster or crab at some point."
3244,"Always LOVE the raw bar! They have happy hour for oysters on Mon-Fri from 4-6pm where oysters are half off. Their seafood are always very fresh, clean, and delicious. Prices are actually great for the quality and location. They're also very generous with lemon slices and condiments. My favorite items to order at the raw bar are diver scallops, dozen oysters, cherrystone and little neck clams, rock crab claw, and uni. They're addicting. There's also a fish market next to the bar where they sell sashimi grade fish and you can make your own sashimi. You can find caviar here, ikura, masago, tobiko, and a variety of Japanese grocery items. If you feel like devouring a whole lobster some day, this is the best place to get it in NYC!"
3245,"Experience: We were at the market was overwhelmed with all the choices. Came across this place and it did not disappoint. Since it was crowded inside and the weather was decent at the time, we decided to order and eat outside. No complaints.Parking: We were visiting New York City and we decided not to drive. So unsure how the parking situation is around this area.Worth: If you are by the area and unsure what to get, I believe the Lobster Place is decent choice. The lobster was good and the sushi was satisfying (as pictured below). Note, it is pretty proceed but what do you expect? It's New York and it's lobster!"
3246,This place gets packed!It's a must experience if you're in Chelsea market and try craving lobster!We ordered a lobster roll and the Seafood platter and was super full by the time we left. The lobster was perfectly cooked and the seasoning on the potatoes and mussels were amazing. Great spot for some fresh seafood!
3247,"I've had a lot of lobster rolls, sashimi and nigiri in my lifetime, but I was blown away by this place when we stopped in. I was expecting it to be good since someone recommended it, but I was not expecting it to be the best I ever had. The photos do not lie.The seafood is so fresh - I would swear they just caught everything that morning. The lobster roll wasn't too heavy like some places - their recipe is light and simple, and brings out the natural flavor and freshness of the lobster. The sashimi and nigiri melt in your mouth - I would have eaten a lot more if I didn't eat so much for breakfast.We were here around lunch time and just had a speechless meal - we could not believe how good everything was, lol. This is part of a big market, so you can buy things to cook at home as well. Definitely come here if you love seafood - this is easily some of the best seafood in Manhattan, and the best lobster roll I've ever had. Yes, even comparing it to lobster rolls in Boston, San Francisco, Annapolis, etc!"
3248,"The Lobster Place is truly a seafood heaven. We did not intend to eat dinner at Chelsea Market, but we also could not resist the temptation to visit this one-of-a-kind seafood hall. The place is very well organized, neat and clean. They also served good quality seafood at a reasonable price!We ordered some oysters and a lobster roll -- both were very delicious! The lobster roll was served cold and I dunked it with a side of butter between every bite. Definitely will come back again!"
3249,"Worth it? YesRepeat? YesTucked in the Chelsea Market, this place has sushi, sashimi, lobster rolls and oysters.There are sit down seating at the sushi bar and also tall narrow tables scattered in the area. Casual first come first serve place.+Lobster Bake is a good assortment of food. Steamed well, but can get a little messy+Lobster Roll is good. Not too much Mayo+Fresh Oysters"
3250,Staying nearby on my trip to NY and stumbled across this place. Love the lobster roll but the the lobster bisque is bland. Nordstrom has better lobster bisque with chunks of lobster in it. Other than that. My meal was amazing. Perfect quick meal except the cashier didn't tell me where to pick up my food so I just stood there until I asked how much longer for my food. Well apparently it was sitting at the counter behind me.
3251,"The whole set up is pretty cool! It's not like a traditional dine in which made it fun.This place had many firsts for many.This is where I first had lobster like this. It's good! It's just expensive for what it is. Once you learn how to cook lobster, that's the way, but if you're not that type of person, this is probably a must go for you. You get the lobster on a tray. Dipped in butter, it's so good.This is also the first place that I had a lobster roll that wasn't just mayo and imitation crab or lobster. It was delicious, like really good. You really tasted the lobster on it. If you never had a good lobster roll, you gotta try it. My favorite lobster roll.Also my first lobster bisque. It's good!Expensive, but delicious? Or Delicious, but expensive?The order matters, but I can't decide."
3252,"Great place for oysters. They have many options and don't panic, there is a chart that can help you choose from big to small and salty to sweet oysters. Ordered from each category, big and salty, small and salty and small and sweet. All oysters were $3 each and the clams were $2 each. My favorite was the oyster from the big and salty section, the Widows Hole. Also tried the sea urchin ($21), delicious! Very meaty, creamy and fresh-tasting pieces of sea urchin. Be prepared to wait for a seat. This place is extremely busy during the weekends."
3253,"Came with a friend for Saturday lunch around 12:30 to try out the lobster rolls here. We weren't too hungry as we had eaten other spots in the market, so we decided to split a roll here.The space is fairly large, with plenty of counter seating as well as some tables where you can stand and eat.They have a decent selection of seafood dishes on their menu, but we only ordered the Maine lobster roll ($18.95). Our food came out pretty quickly, within 7-8 minutes.We thought the price was pretty affordable until we saw the size of the roll... yes they don't skimp on the lobster, but the roll was tiny and each half could be finished in 2-3 bites easily. See my picture where I'm holding half of the roll for reference...The lobster roll itself was okay. A bit on the bland side, but that's how most of the lobster rolls I've tried are."
3254,"I came here on a whim as I was just looking at a place to eat while walking around New York. Inside the seats were packed, but it was nice they had an outside option with benches and heat. The food is pricey but it's lobster! It was pretty good. I also got soup that was decent as well.It's nice if u got some money to spend and is craving lobster! But it was nothing amazing or extraordinary in my opinion. It's something quick and easy.It's nice to walk around the area of this place though since there's a buncha other restaurants on the inside and some clothing stores on the block. It's an interesting little area with a market inside. I recommend going at least once!"
3255,"C&P Galley had the best beer battered fish and chips in NYC. Maybe it's due to the pandemic, but it's no longer on the menu. Instead, shrimp & fish & chips(5 shrimps 1 piece of fish) has taken its place on the menu. Unfortunately the fish was not beer battered, but breaded. It was dry and not perfectly flaky & tender like its predecessor, and the texture was rather powder-y/malt-y. On the other hand, the breaded shrimps were flavorful, and the tartar sauce is as good as that of pre-pandemic. Chips(fries) could be a bit more crisp. PLS BRING BACK THE BEER-BATTERED FISH & CHIPS C&P GALLEY. You can keep the shrimp! + I also noticed that there was no more Salmon Poke. :( The Faroe Island salmon poke had the freshest salmon ever. Sadly, that is long gone as well. Lobster Roll had a good portion of lobsta. The taste & texture was not very fresh imo."
3256,"My friend kept hyping how this place has really good oysters. I was thinking to myself, ""how good can oysters get?"" I was DEFINITELY proven wrong when I came here.Best. Oysters. Ever. Period.Before coming to this place I didnt know there could be different flavor profiles for oysters. They could be sweet or salty or in between. My boyfriend and I shared a dozen of oysters for roughly $30 and it is a bit pricey but we are paying for good quality seafood.The cocktail sauce, vinegar, and lemon made the oysters more flavorful. Because our platter had variety, i am not sure which one i ate. The number 1 most memorable oyster was probably this sweet one. I have never eaten a sweet oyster and now, its my absolute favorite."
3257,"Located inside Chelsea Market's raw market, the Lobster Place has one of the best lobster rolls I've ever had. It is also decently priced for such a popular place that receives so many tourists. The clam chowder is also nothing short of amazing as well. Neatly served in a little bread bowl, this is also one of the best clam chowder I've ever had. Just order at the little cashier station, get your number ticket and patiently wait for them to call your number. There are plenty of seating inside the raw market as long as you don't sit at the sushi bar because apparently that is reserved for ordering sushi only. Lunch is always busy because it's lunch time and it's Chelsea. But it is totally worth the wait and the experience. It is a must to visit if you're in NYC for some good eats."
3258,"I decided that i really wanted to visit the Chelsea market. I had my heart set on going to the Lobster Market. They open at 11am and it was only 9:30am so i had alot of time to kill.The last time i visited here was pre-pandemic. I would always grab the pre-packaged shrimp with cocktail sauce. I love the Lobster bisque here. It's delicious.  At 11am i walked over to Lobster Place. This place is amazing. It's the absolute BEST when it first opens. I wasn't the only one waiting to get in. There was at least 10 people waiting. So once the lunch crowd comes in, its not as peaceful. This place is popular and for good reasons. I sat immediately at the Oyster bar, that's what i went for. They checked my vaccination card and every other person who walked in and sat down. I was able to get my order in really quickly. I first ordered 6 oysters and a diet coke. I got the merasheen bay, coleville bay, eel lake, duxbery gem, orient point pearl and widow's hole. I loved them all. There were two smallers ones that i loved the best. Too bad i didnt know which was which. I wish they told me which was which. I would of only ordered more of those two i completely loved. But honestly they were all so good i ended up getting a second order. I ended up eating 12 oysters all by myself. Overall i really enjoy coming here. Its honestly best to come early. The lunch rush is bananas and can be overwhelming. I was able to take my time. Everyone inside was so nice, patient and attentive. The service was great.I cant wait to come back."
3259,"Confused whether the little shop inside the Lobster Place seafood market has a name of its own? I'll just leave it under this Yelp Business. However it's the place when you make a beeline from the door and hug the right wall. Menu is pricey but at the moment I decided to reward myself after a long morning of walking. Ordered the half pound grilled lobster ($18) with disco chowder fries (Bayside seasoned fries with a dollop of clam chowder soup) - not sure about the price of the fries. The lobster was tasty but small. Not piping hot. They do give you a little plastic stabbing fork, a wedge of lemon, melted butter and some sanitizing wiped for fingers. The string fries were well seasoned but I should have just gotten a side order of the soup on its own. It was pretty delicious - the NE clam chowder soup. My total with tip was a little, alot pricey. Not sure if I'd come back for more. Maybe just a soup. :)"
3260,"So glad to see this spot is open even though so many of the spots in Chelsea Market are still closed. They have the added bonus of having their own seating both at the tables or the bars around the restaurant. There's also a bunch of seafood related specialty items you can take to go from things like wasabi to fish stock to canned squid.To order you walk through the entrance and walk straight until you reach the counter where there's a very friendly lady to help you out. Place our order, get our number, find a seat, and wait. The food comes out pretty quickly.For my meal I got the following:1) Lobster Roll: For $18 at a popular tourist destination I wasn't too sure what to expect. The roll isn't huge but it's actually quite filled with lobster. The lobster is fairly sweet and the quality was also pretty good. It wasn't dressed too much but just enough to add a fattier texture in your mouth. (3.75/5)2) 6 Oysters (Each $3, one of each type available):-Iron Island: Bright and almost cloudy with firm edges. Salty but not too briny. One of my faves-Robinhood: Simultaneously cucumbery and clean with a hit of salt-Duxbury: Fruity and light flavor-Orient Point: Complex flavor with a silky after-texture-Pearl: Bouncy and clean with a neutral flavor-Cougar Creek: Like a fresh cucumber. It's so crisp but soft all at once. Another faveOverall, I really enjoyed my visit here. The raw bar was probably one of the highlights for me but I did just love the atmosphere and menu selection in general."
3261,"Tasty BUT EXPENSIVE! The lobster and the toasted bread they use tastes amazing for the famous lobster roll! But you are spending $20!!! On a hot dog size roll... (and I mean the basic hits dogs you get from any supermarket, not the giant Costco hot dogs) I would say try it if it's your first time at the Lobster Place, but I don't think it's worth trying again! It's just too expensive.. overall the location was very cute and clean!"
3262,"Seafood heaven!Recently tried the oyster sampler platter for two and some sushi rolls. Everything was very fresh and delicious! We preferred the east coast oysters, specifically the ones from MA and NY.The shrimp tempura roll was divine! Try it!"
3263,"My favorite raw bar in NYC. They serve a variety of east coast and west coast oysters, my personal favorite is the Cougar Creek (from Fanny Bay, BC) because of the sweet flavor and medium sized meat. I usually go to their happy hour and get two dozen oysters (I love oysters, don't judge me), it's Monday-Friday 4-6PM. I also recommend getting the red sea urchin (from California). It is more on the salty side but very firm in texture, and they serve it in the black spikey shell."
3264,So glad to be able to visit the Chelsea Market again in over two years! We wanted some good seafood and decided to check out lobster place especially it's got good amount of seating throughout the restaurant. Loved counter seating so we could watch sushi chef in action!Decided to get lobster roll and fries. Lobster roll was loaded with pieces but was rather small. The fries were surprisingly delicious. We also got rainbow rolls and bars chirashi which were very fresh and pretty filling. Staff was friendly and service was quick. Definitely a great place to dine. You can also get a whole lobster cooked to order if you wish.
3265,"The lobster rolls are pretty great but holy crap this place is so expensive. Came on a Sunday evening for dinner. A friend and I decided to share the  Lobster Roll Picnic Box. The lobster roll was really good but this thing was so tiny! Given that they serve fish and chips I assumed the chips that came with the box would also be french fries, but no we were given a bag of potato chips which didn't really add much to the meal. For the soup we got the Lobster Bisque, which was pretty good but was served to us almost lukewarm. After the meal, we ended up going to another restaurant for ramen cause we were still pretty hungry. Overall, the lobster roll was great and I'm glad I tried it once, but I don't think it's worth coming back for."
3266,"This place is super spacious and located inside Chelsea Market. If you just enter the market and keep walking, you'll be sure to see it. Inside, there's a lot of bar seating, so I wouldn't worry too much about table availability unless you have a huge group. You order at the back and then pick it up nearby. The ambiance is nice as you can see the sushi chefs preparing things in the middle and the seafood area on the left. Lobster Roll Picnic Box ($24) - This is actually super pricy for what you get. It comes with a lobster roll, a small soup, and chips. I got the lobster bisque for my soup and it was just alright. It tasted weird - like slightly bitter. Chips are standard potato chips. As for the actual lobster roll, it had a generous of lobster in it, but I felt like it lacked a lot of flavors. The roll itself was also pretty flavorless and thought it could use a lot more butter. Overall, unremarkable lobster roll especially for the price."
3267,"The fish sandwich was amazing! Light and fresh. The lobster roll is always good. But the fresh lobster is the star here. One of the best and probably freshest places where you can get lobster in NYC. A good selection of beers as well. It's self serve - you order and find a seat and you'll be called when your food is ready. This place is tucked inside Chelsea Market. If you're looking for something casual with communal bar seating, you'll like this. If you're looking for something more romantic and like a traditional sit down restaurant, then this may not be your style."
3268,"Overall I really enjoyed the food here! This was actually my first time having a lobster roll. It was also my first time trying raw oysters! The lobster roll was full of nice meaty chunks of lobster and wasn't overly dressed with mayo or outshined by the other ingredients in the lobster salad! I was admittedly very nervous to try the oysters, not because of the flavor but because of the texture. However, it actually turned out to be soooo good! I will definitely be having those again. The Old Bay fries were a simple classic but done well. Nice and crispy, hot, and well seasoned. The only reason this gets one star off is because i feel like the portions of both the filling of the lobster roll and the fries were a bit skimpy for what you pay. Nonetheless, I'd still recommend checking this place out!instagram: @newyorkcityfoodie"
3269,"I've passed by this place so many times and finally stopped in with some friends. We ordered the scallops with yuzu, toro don with a side of Hokkaido uni, unagi don, spicy lobster roll, some oysters and the snow maiden sake. Wow everything here was super fresh. We loved the scallops, toro and the unagi. The fish was really buttery and their soy sauce hit differently as well. Prices here are reasonable. Expect to spend around $20 per entree and oysters were $3. The restaurant has a sushi, seafood, lobster area with bar seating and table seating for large parties in the back. Highly recommend this place if you love seafood. They have a little bit of everything for everyone and the service is really great as well."
3270,"If you like lobster and sushi; this is the right place. Very casual busy place with a huge selection of delicious sushi. We came here twice in one of weekend!  Not fancy, great service and good food. Don't sit at the bar unless you're ordering sushi. But you can combine sushi and lobster and still sit at the bar. That's what we did the second visit. They didn't tells that the first time and I didn't like my spot to eat. But the food was great and we came back!!"
3271,The best lobster rolls in the Chelsea area. Perfect chilled lobster on top of a nice warmed roll. Not too much mayo. I prefer these to Luke's because the lobster portions are slightly bigger. The addition of the outdoor public seating at Chelsea Market is also a major plus.The fries are also a must try! One order is enough for 2 people. They put old bay seasoning on it and they stay crispy for a very long time.
3272,"Not a big fan of seafood products, but the quality of seafood was amazing! My friend and I had ordered a few meals, and were completely satisfied. Def recommend!"
3273,"SO GOOD.We ordered the clam chowder in bread bowl (amazingly delicious), lobster bisque, lobster roll and old bay fries. EVERYTHING is good. Service was fast and friendly and we will be back. Thank you for the delicious meal!"
3274,The best Lobster place in NYC. It is located in Chelsea Market and they have so many other options. Lobster is boiled to perfection and it is affordable. (MKT ~30 dollars) Lobster is huge and can be shared with two people for sure.  Tip: Go during HH to enjoy some oysters.Pro Tip: Try the Lobster if you haven't.Follow me on Instagram @willeatfood
3275,"Today we ate at Lobster Place outside where we had oysters and also the grilled or broiled oysters with herbs and cheese, grilled lobster, sushi rolls and fried fish with  French fries.Aside from the weather, the food was delicious! Service outdoors was also very good.  You order from the window.  There is a bell to tap and ring if no one is there.  It is located on 16th street in case you want to eat outside.After eating we went inside to buy some fish from them.  They also sell prepared escargot where all you have to do is pop it in the oven at home anytime you'd want some.Great seafood store!They have picnic bench with umbrellas or a built outdoor fixture with partitions between every table."
3276,"This place is awesome!!! We walked in when visiting the Chelsea market. We had just had dinner, but wanted to try some oysters! We had oysters and crab legs!!! Delicious ! Highly recommend ! Definitely returning again and trying the lobster next time !"
3277,Fresh custardy seasonal uni and perfectly executed juicy lobster rolls in NYC? @The Lobster Place at Chelsea Market is the place to satisfy all your seafood cravings. Be sure to check out their oysters and clam chowder as well!
3278,"The lobster roll was slamming! I found myself at Chelsea Market on a warm Sunday. I'd missed grabbing a lobster roll during restaurant week so this was my chance. I got my go-to summer order: oysters and lobster roll. East coast oysters are my favorite and they were super fresh and briny. I'll have to return for the HH 1/2 price special YUMThe order came out quickly so I knew it was 'Pre-packaged, which lowered my expectations. I was wrong. The lobster was plentiful and not overdressed. The bun was buttery l, crispy and still a bit warm. It tasted delicious  It would have been a rare 5 but the spicy mango rita was watery. They are observing COVID precautions with a temp check and tracing. There's seating separated by barriers."
3279,"I have been craving a Lobster roll for quite a while now and I was geeked to stumble upon Lobster Place on the NY Restaurant Week 2021 website. The restaurant is located in the Meatpacking District inside Chelsea Market and they have heated outdoor dining that all of the restaurants inside the market share (I took advantage of it since I wanted to eat my roll fresh and not when I arrived home).For just $20.21, you'll get a Maine lobster roll (your choice of cold or warm), Cape Cod chips and a choice of New England clam chowder, Manhattan clam chowder or lobster bisque.Their lobster roll is simply OUTSTANDING!!! Of course I ordered mine warm. It was quite a cold day as well. It had fresh claw and tail meat, celery, scallions, lemon & mayo, on a grilled top-split bun. It was so savory and buttery. I didn't want it to end! Lobster rolls truly aren't made big enough. I absolutely could have eaten three of those in one sitting! I was torn between the New England clam chowder and the lobster bisque. I went with the lobster bisque and I have no regrets. It was super yummy and the perfect consistency. Truly a wonderful compliment to my delectable lobster roll. I will be returning!"
3280,"The Lobster Place is open and busy! The tables were full so we ordered our food and sat by the bar, which was a big mistake since all you do is stare at the seafood and order more than you can eat. All jokes aside, the service was good and our food came out pretty quickly.I got the lobster roll ($18.95) and the shrimp cocktail ($13). The lobster roll was kind of small but full of delicious lobster meat. The bread was nicely toasted and I love the crunch the celery added. Perfect amount of sauce. The shrimp were HUGE, however some tasted watery like they were previously frozen. Kind of disappointing since the 6 shrimps I got were $13! The frozen strawberry lemonade vodka wasn't bad, super sour so it kind of covers the taste of the vodka. I would come again for the lobster roll! Can't go wrong with it."
3281,My first ever lobster roll. Generous amount of lobster put in. Though I wasn't too fond of the Texas toast. I'd say the lobster filling is savory with a touch of sweetness. Good piece of lobster would recommend
3282,"Walked in on a weekday afternoon and the place was packed. You order, pay, wait for your ticket number to be called, collect order, and find an open seat or leave. Not sure what a good lobster roll is supposed to be like, but this was pretty alright--lightly dressed lobster chunks with celery and onion. Only thing is that it was underseasoned and I felt like more mayo or some kind of moisture was needed because everything was dry. Don't know if the item is worth $20."
3283,"If I lived closer I'd be here all the time.Order your food and drinks at the window. They give you a number and you find your own place to sit. Despite it being a super busy Sunday, the oysters came within 10 minutes, fully shucked and ready to eat!There's a blackboard where you can see the current oyster varieties they have, and they break it down for you by how sweet/salt and small/large they are. very user friendly!There's also a wide selection of wine bottles for purchase to enjoy at home and also a fresh seafood market. We ended up buying a slab of red snapper and ugh it was amazing.Love that they seem to have it together despite being hella busy while trying to maintain pandemic regulations."
3284,"First time my friend and I came here. We shared a king crab maki roll and a pair of oysters. The oysters  were $3 per piece and the maki was about $15 for 6 pieces. The flavor of both were okay, not anything worth coming back for. Service was friendly though."
3285,"Stopped by looking for lobster rolls and instead bumped into Oyster Happy Hour!! By far, one of the best impromptu experiences yet. Randy was very very helpful in advising which oysters were the best to pick. After all is said and done, Mystic and Indian Cove are the tastiest (in my opinion) and enjoyed with lemon as a dressing. Enjoy!"
3286,They have a delicious assortment of fresh raw oysters! It's conveniently located inside of Chelsea Market. Definitely try to get seated at the bar (you'll get your food faster)!
3287,"My friend and I were in the area trying to decide what we wanted to eat. We walked around to different restaurants but when we came by The Lobster Place, the waitress was so sweet to us as we looked at the menu. We asked her what is the top item to try being that it was our first time and she recommended the Lobster Roll (hot) and the New England Clam Chowder. My friend and I decided to get one to share because we didn't read any reviews prior so we were walking in blind. I MUST SAY THAT WAS THE BEST DECISION EVER!! We found a spot to sit outside and one of the heated areas, and ENJOYED EVERY BITE! We couldn't believe how flavorful everything was. The roll was so soft with the perfect amount of butter, the lobster--omgggg best I ever had. And to seal it, the clam chowder was the perfect touch! Next time we're getting our own rolls because it was way tooooo good.I will definitely be back again!!!! A must try if you're ever in the area and get your own roll because you won't want to share after your first bite!"
3288,"This is located in Chelsea market and is known for their whole lobsters. More than 75% of the people during my pre covid19 visit were eating the lobster meal. The line was long but moved fast. Seating is limited so you have to be able to jump as soon as a seat becomes available. We opted for the seafood slider trio to share since we wanted to try a couple of places. The crab was fantastic, lobster was ok (but we aren't fans of lobster) and the shrimp was disappointing (nothing remarkable, a bit bland). They let us try every single soup before settling on a large bowl of the king crab chowder. It had huge chunks of crab in a creamy broth that wasn't overly bitter from too many shells, like the lobster bisque was (yuck)."
3289,"I came on a weekend during COVID so a lot of Chelsea market restaurants were closed. It ended up working out because I got to try The Lobster Place! I'm happy I did because I ended up really enjoying the meal. I ordered through the outside window and sat at one of the heated booths (it's well heated and separated from other tables). I got the warm lobster roll and my SO got the Hokkaido bowl. Our two friends got the lobster roll picnic lunch (with a roll, chips, and clam chowder). I thought the lobster roll was great though (as is usually the case) very small and $$. I got a chance to try my friends clam chowder and that was really yummy and great for a cold day (also nice for something a little more filling). I had the shrimp from my SO's Hokkaido bowl but didn't try anything else. The shrimp was really fresh though so I assume everything else was as it should have been. Overall a nice meal if you're willing to spend a bit more for lunch."
3290,100/10 would recommend this place. Easily my favorite spot for lobster rolls in NY. I always have to come here when I come to visit. It's located within Chelsea Market so you have the opportunity to try other food spots as well. The lobster is always so cold and fresh. The price can be a bit steep but it's a guilty pleasure.
3291,"Lobster rolls!!! What a treat. I enjoyed nice  big chunks of claw meat, but I noticed my hot Connecticut style roll looked a bit smaller than my friends' Maine rolls. We got their Lobster Roll Picnic Basket that included a bag of chips and small cup of soup (lobster bisque was just okay).We ate here during covid outdoor dining, which is pretty nice at Chelsea Market!! Only slight difficulty was waiting for a table in the required area to enjoy beer/cocktails."
3292,"[takeout review]Delicious hot lobster rolls with perfectly crispy buttery bread. The sandwich is small but they're generous with the lobster. I ask for extra butter on the side because.. why not?Service is prompt and friendly. Well packaged for take out - might get a little messy if you did delivery.There is outdoor dining if you wish. Well spaced apart. During the winter, they built wooden structures to protect against the elements, but are still very open and separate dining parties. It's not super crowded during weekday lunch time."
3293,"The essence of late summer is right here. A picture is worth a thousand words. Oh, those lusciously fresh oysters and clams. Close your eyes, you can hear the ocean sing in your mouth. Friendly and skillful oyster men, hats off to you."
3294,What a great place in a crowded area. Nice outdoor seating. We ordered our food at a window and they brought us our drinks and food. Two of us had fish sandwiches. One salmon burger and one crab cake sandwich. All very good and reasonably priced. We got two orders of fries which were plenty for the four of us. Great fries by the way. Had a pitcher of beer too. Highly recommend. We'll be back. Plus it was quiet enough to talk.
3295,"This review is based on an outdoor dining experience, so before you read on, I have no comment on what the restaurant itself is like, other than to note in walking by that it had only stool seating at counters.  We opted for the spacious covered outdoor space, where ordering is done at a window and then food is delivered to the table.  I had the lobster roll dinner, which came with a very nice clam chowder and a bag of chips.  The lobster roll was on the smaller side, but was full of lobster that was lightly dressed and very delicious.  At $23, I thought it was fairly priced given the going rate for lobster.  Husband had a fried shrimp & fish plate that he enjoyed, but he said the shoestring fries were just ok.  They have a limited cocktail/wine menu outside; the cocktail was tried was nice & strong."
3296,Our go-to place during pandemic for dinner.  Seafood fresh as always.  Great place to eat with friends as you can have sushi/lobster rolls/poke bowls at one place.  You can't go wrong with the lobster rolls and fries.  Dragon roll and rainbow rolls were yummy.  The outdoor tables feel safe and clean.  You order from the window and they deliver to your table when ready.  Just be sure to get there on the earlier side as their last order is around 7:50.
3297,Lobster roll was good but the atmosphere was horrible. Terrible touristy cafeteria.My meal cost just as much as if I had gone to a sit down dinner at one of the extremely awesome seafood restaurants nearby.  I'm not going to mention their names as I do not want any of the mouth breathers waddling their way over there and stealing my table.
3298,Lobster bisque for the win!!! Daughter enjoyed salmon burger and the fries were perfect crispness!!! Great stop!
3299,"over price and limited oyster selections, $3 eachthe biggest oyster on the menu is smaller than what we had elsewhere.over crowded and no social distancing."
3300,Came here on a hot day and this was just the perfect gelato fix I needed. As someone who is indecisive I loved the endless amount of flavors that they had but it was so hard narrowing it down to just two flavors. I just want to try them all! On the bright side they allow customers to try two flavors so that helped me decide.I went with the double scoop for $4.50 and got their earl grey and black sesame and I am definitely a fan. The gelato was flavorful and the tea flavor was perfect in the earl grey and not too pungent. The black sesame gelato was creamy and tiny sesame seeds blended in. I would definitely recommend both these flavors!Sadly the service was a bit lacking and extremely slow. Nobody wants to wait 15 minutes to get their ice cream when the store is empty... hopefully this will not be the case the next time I visit.
3301,"TLDR: location in walking distance from Ippudo. Get the Brown Butter. Try to sample what you are going to get so you know you like the texture/flavor but choose samples wisely due to sample limit. We were really excited to try this gelato place for dessert after we went to Ippudo for dinner. Funnily we were planning to go to their other location and just discovered this one by chance.My recommendation is to sample what you are going to get if you can. There is supposedly a 2 sample limit so choose wisely! Based on my tastes: skip the fig and buttermilk. Unless you love buttermilk and for those who don't know buttermilk has a slightly sour flavor. Maybe if you love tart yogurt you would like it - not for me.Brown Butter was my personal fave and the one flavor everyone in our group got! Other flavors we enjoyed were pistachio, walnut nucello(?), the orange gelato (not sorbet). Supposedly Salted Caramel is the most popular flavor but it was out of stock.Side note: there is a wall with restaurant business cards that showcase restaurants that serve this companies gelatos. So cool!"
3302,"Coming out of Katz I told my sister that Sunday afternoon calls out for ice-cream and what could be much better than to cross the street to shop in to the Laboratory of Gelato. It's Italian ice Cream. My favorite choice was hazelnut, pistachio, honey lavender and cardamom to add a bit of spice to our gelato."
3303,"this is a really great gelato place, conveniently directly in-front of Katz delicatessen.A nice vaiety, and the stuff i have tasted so far, real deep flavours.If you're in the area giver them a try... their pistachio is a roasted pistachio.. better tasting that the other 50 odd places i've tried the flavour at previously.this visit however it was back cherry and salted caramel.. i actually liked the combo enough to want it again :)"
3304,"il laboratorio del gelato is always one of my go to spots for sweets in New York. The variety of flavors is something you don't find at most placesAMBIANCEThe lab theme is really unique and the design of the stores is simple yet effectiveFOODI went with the pear sorbet and honey crisp apple this time around. The pear was a really subtle flavor. If you don't like super sweet ice cream, this is the one to go for. The honey crisp apple flavor was a seasonal flavor. It was fresh and you could actually taste little apple bits. OVERALLGreat spot to hit up right after a heavy Katz Deli meal across the street. They have a bunch of unique flavors, and you can't go wrong."
3305,"Not a fan - at all. The gelato flavors are pretty unique but the texture is light and icy, almost. I had their dark chocolate and Turkish coffee flavor in a small cone ($5). I assumed the Turkish coffee would be mostly coffee with some spice, but it was mostly spice with no coffee tones at all. If their unique flavors are all like Turkish coffee, I am not a fan. Unique flavors are only a positive if executed well and tasty. Let's not experiment for experiment's sake."
3306,"Nothing special about this place or the ice cream in general, but they do have a good variety of ice cream flavors. Right now they are doing pick up only, no seating is allowed. They have contactless menu and payment options. Service was great, there's only one person so the wait is bit long if they're more people ahead of you. For us, it took approx. 15mins to get in. I'd say to give it a try if you're in the area, you might like it better than me"
3307,My favorite dessert is ice cream and my favorite flavor of ice cream is pistachio. Whenever I have ice cream I always choose pistachio as one of my choice. il laboratorio has the best pistachio flavored ice cream I have ever had so far! The Turkish coffee was just okay since I don't like one of the ingredient in it.
3308,"I was in the area with a few friends and after a long, hot day, we decided to end our night with some gelato. I've been meaning to try this place out for a while and glad I finally did. They have minimal seating here but probably enough for 10 people or so, just to keep in mind.After trying a few flavors, I went with the Amaretto Crunch and Pistachio flavors on a sugar cone ($4.50). Both flavors were delicious and actually went well together. They weren't super sweet and the sugar cone added that level of crunch that I always like. Overall, it's a solid spot to get your gelato fix, and if I'm back in the area wanting gelato, I wouldn't mind coming back here."
3309,My friend and I had stopped by Katz deli for sandwiches and we decided to stop by this gelato shop to get a sweet treat! You get a choice of two scoops so i got the dulce de leche gelato and salted caramel. My friend order mango sorbet and another flavor. The gelato was melt in your mouth delicious. My friend also really enjoyed the sorbet. Customer service was great as well! The two ladies behind the counter were very helpful!
3310,"Portion sizes here were fairly small although 4 scoops for like $7.50 is good value. Pistachio was really the only great flavor here, otherwise everything else we tried was OK. Strawberry, Thai, honey lavender were all fairly decent. The place seems like hype and the gelato honestly just tastes more like ice cream than gelato. It's not too creamy at all and there are plenty of other ice cream places to try."
3311,This is the best gelato I've had for creative flavors. Nailing the authenticity but with more creative flavors making this a special place. Highly recommended
3312,"Giving this less than 5 stars seems insane to me.The only unhappiness that I've ever had about this place is that sometimes the flavor that I'm dreaming of on any given day isn't available, since they have 200 rotating flavors. But for every time that the thai chili chocolate hasn't been available, I've been forced to get a new fig flavor (who knew there were so many?). Coming here is a slam-dunk date to try out flavors alone.The take-home pint is not too shabby a deal, and I've happily eaten my way through a pint of basil over a weekend (okay, over a couple hours). Basil is definitely the new mint, y'all."
3313,"I have never ever had gelato as unique as il laboratorio del gelato. This gelato was so delicious it reminded me of gelato I had in St. Maarten. For $4.25 I was able to get two flavors, I chose rose and lavender honey. For the rose, I tasted hints of rose petals and the gelato was creamy and fragrant. It reminded me of rose milk tea a bit! For the lavender honey flavor, it was not too strong and had a perfect balance. If you've been to lavender by the bay you would know the smell of fresh lavender; and now you can get it in gelato form! The rose paired well with the lavender honey and it was perfect for a small dessert! I can't wait to come back and try more flavors especially since they have over 300."
3314,"This is our neighborhood  Gelato parlor and they never disappoint!!!! My favorite is the rice I just love it on this day they did not have it so I went for the sesame seed and a vanilla which was still oooo so good They usually allow you to get three samples but because of the Covid there's no more simples and no more sitting inside and you can't even lick your gelato inside (so mad) but still the flavors are good I remember when this place first open !!!! You actually see the staff  making the gelato ,the whole store is surrounded by glass which is nice and my My sister from Philly just loves this place"
3315,"Came around closing with a friend and we sampled some flavors. We shared two scoops, I forgot what he chose but I picked the basil and it was SO GOOD. Surprisingly. Basil gelato? Who knew?This has to be one of the most unique gelato places in NYC based on their flavor selections. It really does look like a laboratory in there."
3316,"Finally came to this place after booking it on my yelp for over a couple years. Thanks to my friend who brought me here, which was close by the Open House we were headed to. This place has so many unique flavors to offer.  I tried exotic flavors that other places normally don't.  Guava, Rosemary and honey crisp Apple,  they were all good.  I also sample my friends' two flavor of lavender and earl grey, they were good as well.  I wish they have the honey melon one as well, I had had some awesome honey melon gelato in Italy and they are forever remembered. Def will come back here to try other flavors that I didn't try."
3317,"wow very good creamy gelato! service staff is super nice and actually let me try a third flavor (they have a sign that says STRICTLY ENFORCING ONLY TWO TASTES hahaha). i tried the basil, mint, honey lavender, chocolate chocolate, mint chocolate chip, mocha, and malt. My only thing is that the flavors with the chips, the chips themselves are kind of hard and crumbly and don't really blend with the actual ice cream very well. I really liked their honey lavender alot and the mint was good too!! they don't advertise it but they do have a kids scoop of only one flavor on a cone. Theres like two actual table tops in this location but a bunch of steel bench space. Really spacious and roomy on the inside."
3318,"I love this place. Always interesting and delicious flavors! If you are lucky like me today, you get help from really lovely staff and have a nice conversation to let all the unhappiness go away. I missed Celery and Guinness flavors. It's so hard to meet them again since they change flavors all the time and randomly (I suppose)..."
3319,"One of my favorite gelato places, but the best part is (custom) cakes that don't cost an arm and a leg.  The cakes are also covered in gelato instead of regular frosting, so extra bonus points for that.  The only downside to the cake is the packaging; they wrap it in wax paper and put it in a cardboard box, so it's not easy to carry home, fit in the freezer with the box, or repack if not all consumed in one sitting."
3320,Went here with a friend for brunch and it was a great time! The waffles were amazing and the Nashville hot chicken was super filling and tasted great. Overall great spot and will be coming back again.
3321,"Finally tried the iconic sweet chick! I got the--Honey Garlic Chicken & WafflesShrimp and GritsFlavors were wonderful and was perfectly seasoned. You get a lot of chicken and this was the small size. it was drenched in sauce and crispy on the outside, really good! the waffe was good as well, not to soft but the portion size could be better with the amount of chicken you're getting. overall, i thought it was delicious.the shrimp and grits -- it's not your average ""creamy"" flavor, it's more like tomato saucey, but i still found it good. the grits are cooked very well and you do get a good amount of shrimp. if you don't like tomato sauce though, i wouldn't recommend it.overall, i think it's a good place if you're craving chicken and waffles. they also have music playing always and it's definitely a fun vibe. some days they have a DJ and some events so it's a place you can take a group of friends to hang out as well."
3322,"I dunno. Maybe I am missing the point.The chicken is small, but tender and juicy, overall cooked to perfection. The waffle tastes delicious, but can easily be eaten in less than 30 seconds. The drinks are tart, but are mostly filled with ice. The menu is pricey, despite the fact the restaurant is in a rundown area.The service is quick and cordial, but I ended up not talking to one server. They want you to feel like you are making friends here, but I felt all alone at my table. I wanted to feel part of something special, but all I got was a big nothing burger.I want to give this restaurant four stars. Instead, I am only giving it two.I feel so conflicted, but yet so ashamed."
3323,"This place SUCKS!!!! This is one restaurant that should have closed during the pandemic. My order came out extremely fast. The chicken was cold & didn't taste good at all. Two orders of chicken tenders and a side of potatoe salad &30.00.Sorry, I won't be back"
3324,Hidden Gem Alert!Yummy breakfast sandwiches you can feast on all day!Waffles sandwich is amazing!Hot spicy Crispy Chicken on a Biscuit is amazing!Watermelon tequila conception is amazing!Prices are legit. Atmosphere is laid back. Bohemian vibe.
3325,You will not be disappointed... chicken and waffles melt in your mouth like silk. The vibe is hip and definitely Brooklyn! A nice walk from the Long Island train stop ... go check them out if your in the area
3326,Best chicken and waffles I ever had. The hace 3 options of butter which I try all 3 of course. The waffles was buttery and fluffy and the fried chicken was crispy moist and very flavorful.
3327,I always enjoy going to sweet chick from the drinks to the food I'm never disappointed. I love the Mac and cheese and the purple drank cocktail it's so good and I recommend trying it out . They have a few locations so don't hesitate to stop by.
3328,"Came on VDay. What a crap experience. We spent almost $100 and barely ate everything. Waffles were good, the chicken was alright. The skin we super flavorful, then meat was bland, but moist. Super disappointed at the drinks. Got frozen drinks and the strawberry drink tasted sour, like it was going back and the machine wasn't washed properly. The peach version tasted sour as well, but not as strong as the strawberry one."
3329,"Can never go wrong with southern comfort food! Came here on a Saturday afternoon and surprisingly the wait wasn't too long. We ordered the Nashville chicken and waffles and the buffalo chicken sandwich. Interestingly, the buffalo chicken sandwich was a bit spicier than the Nashville, which was supposed to be the spicier one! I loved the chicken and waffle with a bit of vanilla glaze on top and then some honey. This combination always leaves you extremely satisfied and happy!"
3330,"This place was amazing! My only issue is if you go in they had us waiting in the corner for a while, it was a bit strange. Once we got our order in finally it took about 20 minutes. I ordered the honey garlic  chicken and waffles it was amazing!!!! My friend got BBQ chicken but for some reason it comes with jalapeños. He enjoyed it but it isn't the normal BBQ taste. I'd come back here 100% worth it and it wasn't Pricy. It's worth your $ the sweet tea is also amazing"
3331,"Yummmm what can go wrong with fried chicken? I came with a girlfriend on a lazy Saturday when we were taking the day to explore Williamsburg. We were quickly seated and ordered via the app -- which I strongly prefer because it's less flagging down the waiter and more food on demand. The interior is set up like a park! There are picnic style benches as well as the regular chair/table set up. Ordering is done through their app/website with a QR code. I ordered the honey chicken sandwich, as did my friend. We split the potato salad. All of it was delicious and I wish I had tried more of their appetizers and their beverages! We came late and I really wanted to try their breakfast options but definitely next time. The staff is great, super helpful with anything needed and a great overall vibe. Will definitely be back!"
3332,"To go order of the Nashville hot chicken sandwich (fried ofc), which was definitely delicious, but also not mindblowing. Also got the power slaw which was mainly to get my veggies in for the day, but it actually went pretty great with the sandwich. Hope to be back for a dine in experience and try the chicken and waffles someday."
3333,"This place is iconic! I've been to sweet chick too many times to count now for both dining in and take out and every time it's amazing. Sweet chick has the best chicken and waffles in NYC. Trust me because I would choose chicken and waffles as my last meal over steak. I like my fried chicken classic exactly like how they serve it at sweet chick: well seasoned, crunchy exterior but not too hard, juicy on the inside, nothing too extra. I love the selection of butters that come with the waffles. I also love the cocktails here- love purple drank. The mac and cheese is either good or great depending on the day but definitely always comforting. The shrimp and grits are also bomb but i'd never choose that over chicken and waffles. I've been to other locations that sometimes had their chicken overcooked but this OG location always does it 100% right."
3334,Amazing! The service is prompt & the ambiance is great. I've been here a few times & ever sandwich I've ordered has been amazing. Great music choice! Highly recommended!
3335,Awesome chicken sandwich and honey garlic chicken & waffles. Very fast service too. They know what they're doing
3336,"It was my first time trying chicken and waffles and I've been missing out all these years. Although you can't make reservations and no waiting list, it was worth the wait (30 minutes). Sometimes it can be longer but went on a weekday and rainy so it wasn't that bad. Once you're seated, you use the QR code on the table to order your food, then you'll receive what you ordered. It was pretty fast. I ordered: 1. Classic chicken & waffles w/ bacon n' cheddar 2. Nashville chicken & waffles w/bacon n' cheddar 3. Jalapeño cheddar hush puppies 4. Mac & Cheese5. Original lemonade Everything was delicious! Will definitely come back!"
3337,"So my friend decided to treat me here for my bday, it was cool haven't been here in a while so definitely was looking forward to the food!Sweet chick is a nice small but clean restaurant. Service fairly good no complaints, the food portion size I would say is definitely for one person. Now for the taste of the food they don't miss! sweet chick don't miss with the chicken and waffles this is definitely a staple you're not going to go wrong with their chicken it's deep-fried and super tender the waffles are amazing! you'll love it this is definitely a spot you need to be at when you are craving those chicken and waffles! I'll leave it at thatDefinitely recommend!"
3338,"Tried sweet chick for the first time and I thought it was ok. I got the spicy honey butter biscuit chicken sandwich and a side of fries. The sandwich was decent, very simple with a light Buffalo sauce flavor (not spicy). The fries were unfortunately cold which made it hard to enjoy. Overall I think it's a good place to try but I'm not sure I would make it my ""go to"""
3339,"Food is AMAZING . I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu. I had the classic chicken and waffles and it was bomb. I also had their house lemonade for the day and it was cucumber lemonade, highly recommend. The customer service is great, everyone that works there is really nice. And the prices are affordable. There are several locations around New York however I visited the location in Brooklyn. I will definitely be back"
3340,"Disappointing... the chicken was cold and oversalted and I think I could've made better chicken tenders and I don't even cook ..The one star is for the waffles , they were yummy... the waitress also acted if I was a bother to her when I wanted to order ."
3341,"The rumors are true: the lines are ridiculous! But parking isn't as terrible as they say. Go down a couple of blocks toward the residential area and you'll easily find parking spots here and there. Since it was freezing cold when I went to sweet chicks, my party and I sought warmth at Martha's Country Bakery diagonally across the street while waiting. We ended up missing Sweet Chicks' call though, so we had to wait a bit longer but they were very accommodating. My boyfriend got the eggs benny while I got the vegetarian chicken and waffles. The fake chicken didn't look that appetizing but it tasted fine! My tastebuds senses hints of taro? It was of course not as juicy as regular chicken but the flavors blended well with the waffle and syrup."
3342,Honestly cannot wait to go back for brunch - the food is amazing and travels surprisingly well!!
3343,Should be a 3.5 because I know they are meeting food protocol for covid but the food is not hot. Best chicken since last time I ate. And the best Mac and cheese and biscuit. But go back to old table service losing the ambiance. And feels like a cafeteria.
3344,"Lil sweet chick you sure are sweet! I ordered a Mac and cheese, honey butter chicken biscuit sandwich, Nashville chicken sandwich, og chicken sandwich. All were tender crispy or spicy and of course very delicious. No one wonder here why these little sandwiches are $11 a pop. One hundred percent worth it. The delivery was punctual."
3345,Loved the concept of this Resturant not sure if this is in place due to the pandemic. You seat yourself and order everything via your phone no wait staff. Food and drinks are brought to you by staff. My partners ordered the chicken and waffles and I had the hot chicken sandwich. Both were delicious ! Highly recommend to anyone in the area !
3346,So yummy!! Chicken was well seasoned & succulent. Cheesy grits were also really good! It's a self service place so you order with the QR code and then they just bring it out to you. I also ordered the bourbon sweet tea but it didn't taste the greatest so I mixed it with my friend's tequila lemonade. The drink is pretty strong too but I'll probably order a different one if I go again. Which I probably will next time I visit New York. Overall 9/10!!
3347,Trash in a bag. It's the gimmick that keeps it alive. Never hot food and it's never fresh.
3348,"Ordered a number of items through seamless. Food took a long time to arrive and was warm at best. Worst part is that they completely got one of my items wrong. I ordered a chicken and biscuits but received a buttermilk chicken sandwich. When I called the restaurant to get my order corrected they offered a weak apology and a refund of the ordered item and they'll ""make sure the kitchen staff knows the difference between the items"". Cool.... but I still don't have my food. I specifically chose to order multiple items from this place because the chicken and biscuits was the one item I wanted, and what do they do? They tell me I can walk .7 miles in 20 degree weather to pick up a new one. How about you fix my order for me and get me the meal I paid for?Will not be ordering again solely on the principal that if I'm paying money for a good or service I expect the good or service. I don't want a refund I want my meal. Don't recommend. Go somewhere better"
3349,I've been ordering takeout but decided to eat in since it had been awhile after the pandemic. This place is not what it used to be! What happened to the service? You have to order online and no one ever comes around to check on u! The food seems reheated-music still great but the lack of service has killed the vibe
3350,"- 10 stars- grilled fish with herbs is delicious- coconut crab curry is delicious, it is spicy tho- make that resey- impeccable service - good wings- great oysters - self pay at the table,  is a perfect idea- tequila drinks were all tasty- I did not like the rum drinks- fun soundtrack"
3351,"My husband and I came to New York from Georgia for our honeymoon to eat all the eats and found this place from watching one of our favorite YouTubers The Fung Bros. Out of the of week long stay, and eating at 11 different places, Fish Cheeks was our most favorite place. We ordered the following:Market Oysters - I am Thai and I am ashamed that I never thought to eat oysters this way but I never want to eat oysters any other way ever again. Shrimp in 3 Crab Sauce - Similar flavor profile to the oysters, so delicious. SomTum Corn Salad - the flavor on this salad was a little too mild for me, but I love the use of corn instead of the traditional papaya salad since the corn added sweetness to the dish. Coconut Crab Curry - They did not skimp on the crab or spice in this dish at all! So much flavor, so much spice. Soooo good. Pakboong Fai Dang - This is my absolute most favorite vegetable to eat and cooked in the best way ever. I was so happy they served this here. This needs to be served at all Thai restaurants. We saw other tables around us get shrimp crackers (not the fry looking one but they colorful abstract shaped ones) so we asked if we could get it too, as it came with tamarind dip (I think). So that was an awesome addition because I love cooking those up and eating them at home all the time! We also ordered the Ya Dong Party shots which tasted like medicine chased pandan iced tea - another favorite of mine (since my mom used to make me pandan iced tea all the time). I also ordered the spicy mango, which I think was good but my mouth was already on fire from all the Nam Jim and coconut crab curry, I couldn't tell if the drink was spicy or not but the drink itself tasted good but not something that was amazing. I am extremely sad that we don't have a place like this in Georgia... might just have to open one up myself. But I'm the mean time, I guess I'll be making these dishes at home! Especially the oysters! Great job to the Chef for bringing out some of the best parts of Thai food to America. You have made this Thai person very proud!"
3352,"Finally visited in person and had an amazing dinner. This is definitely one of my top 5 Thai spots in the city. My boyfriend and I walked in at around 6:30 on a weeknight and got bar seats. We tried:+ Tongue and cheek cocktail + Thank you kha cocktail + Manao mao cocktail + Thai tea+ Crispy rice salad and pork+ Coconut crab curry - spicy but soo good+ Sautéed cabbage + Banana sticky rice dessert My favorite cocktail was the tongue and cheek, and the standout dishes were the crispy rice salad, sautéed cabbage and dessert. Then there's the famous curry, which was super spicy (as advertised!) but soo good. Loved the Thai tea and complimentary shrimp chips as well. Will be back for more - I need to get the crab fried rice again, as well as more fish!!"
3353,"Fish Cheeks has yet to disappoint me and I doubt they ever will.  The ambience, staff, and food have never not been on point.  The drinks are always great and fun, and they do not compromise whether it's during HH or not.  In terms of food or drinks, literally try anything- nothing will disappoint. All in all if you're ever in East Village, you're missing out if you never visited Fish Cheeks yet so do yourself a favor and do so!"
3354,"After hearing many great reviews about the restaurant, I finally was able to go try it with my friends over a weekend. My friends and I were not able to make a reservation in time so we arrived around 2pm hoping that there would not be too many people. Luckily upon arrived, we waiting for approximately 20 mins before being seated at the bar.Our server let us know how to use the contactless menu and payment system and came back in to take our order when we were ready. In the end, we decided to order the crab fried rice, grilled pork cheeks, zabb wings, and tiger prawn karee. The crab fried rice and tiger prawn karee were delicious and not too heavy. The zabb wings were nice & crispy according to my friends because it was a bit too spicy for me to try to eat everything. The pork cheeks were grilled nicely with a thin layer of crispy skin. Overall, the food here is good and I would come back to try the other dishes available during off peak hours."
3355,"They have happy hour everyday from 12-3pm and 5-6pm where you can get a dozen oysters for $18 (vs $34 for non-HH) and $11 for their cocktails (vs $17 for non-HH). It's so worth it!The oysters are AMAZING. I particularly love them because of the green seafood sauce and fried shallots that you can add on top. We also tried the manila clams which came in a delicious basil sauce. For mains, we got the coconut crab curry  and the prawn karee. Both were super flavorful and great to eat with a bowl of rice. Be warned that the coconut crab curry is very spicy. If you're not good at handling spice, maybe skip this. I also loved the cocktails. I ordered a tongue & cheek and my boyfriend got a spicy mango. I definitely want to come back to try their steamed fish!"
3356,"4.5/5After an amazing first experience here a couple years ago, I've absolutely been dying to come back again. Since my friend was visiting I decided to make a reservation for this spot. Even though I tried cooking a couple weeks ahead I had a hard time finding a spot that wasn't a very early dinner or a very late dinner. We ended up opting for the very late dinner at 9 PM. I was very thankful with how flexible the waitress was with our seating arrangement though because we ended up having an extra guest. We were seated in the outdoor spot instead but they have blankets for guests, plastic covers around the tables to trap heat, and heaters. It can still get a bit chilly near the ""doors"" but it's very tolerable. Service was also super friendly. I do wish the tables were a bit larger though since portions aren't crazy but and you need to order multiple plates.My main disappointment during this trip was that they removed the pre-fixe menus which I absolutely loved. While they still had the restaurant week menu, I feel like one of the best parts about this spot was the ability to taste a bit of everything at a reasonable price. We ended up ordering a bunch of dishes individually and sharing. Most of it was still delicious but it wasn't quite the knock out punch like my first visit.For our meal we got the following items:1) Crab Fried Rice: One of the few dishes I liked more than my first visit. Still great crab flavor throughout and just a bit more flavorful than the first visit and stands on it's own as a dish (especially if you're ordering some of the more flavorful small plates). It also came with a sauce that I didn't get during my last visit. It was an herb sauce and it gave the dish another dimension of flavor. (4.5/5)2) Prawn Aob Woosen: I prefer crab over prawn but during this visit they only had the prawn as an option. The prawns here looked huge and moist. It only comes with 3-4 prawns so I didn't get to try any but my friends enjoyed it. Still a springy sticky chewy noodle and a very flavorful but not overpowering sauce (4.5/5)3) Grilled Pork Cheeks w/ Jaew Sauce: Another dish that I enjoyed the first time that wow'ed me again. The cheeks were tender and fatty and it pairs so well with the jaew sauce (which I would really just like a whole container of) (5/5)4) Zabb Wings: Fall off the bone wings with a nice crackly exterior. The mint chile lime flavor almost reminded me of chip powder. Not exactly synthetic but it didn't have that bright freshness of like a squeeze of lime (4.25/5)5) Crispy Rice Salad and Pork: Really tasty. I love larb and this was done exactly how I like it. The meat  was flavorful and a bit tangy. The coconut meat added a subtle sweetness and there was just a ton of aromatics and flavor all around. (4.5/5)6) Plaa Lui San: Usually not a huge fan of whole fried fish and honestly I didn't love this dish on the day of but as the fish softened and the flavors melded more it was quite delicious. The cashews were particularly tasty after soaking in more flavor (4/5)7) Coconut Crab Curry: I thought to myself how spicy could this be? It's really really spicy. If you don't love and super tolerate spice, then pass on this dish. I was able to eat through the crab which I found so sweet and flavorful and I loved the aroma of the coconut but as a whole I could not eat the curry cause it just left my mouth burning (3.5/5) 8) Pandan Coconut Ice Cream w/ Egg Yolk and Ovaltine: The only dessert they had on the menu that night and it was amazing. The tiny bits of coconut meat gave a nice bite and I loved the gritty texture the ovaltine added along with the slightly malty flavor. The egg yolk didn't stand out but it did give the ice cream just a bit of extra richness (4.5/5)Overall, this was a great meal. My expectations were maybe a bit too high from my first visit but even with those high expectations they still delivered a great experience."
3357,"This is always on my list to go to whenever I visit NYC. Honestly, I'd still come back, always! Even though this most recent time I went, my favorite dish was not cooked up to par (Prawn Karee, shrimp was definitely over cooked where the meat tasted like frozen prawn and soggy, not what I'd expect in a $28-30 dollar dish with only prawns that should be the key and most important part to cook carefully). Other than that, everything else was good as usual, especially happy hour oysters Have to get side of rice with this dish , it is a must if you want to enjoy the karee/scrambled egg with something like rice to help balance out the tastes well :)"
3358,"I love Thai food and so I get very excited to try a new Thai place any chance I get! My friend made relatively last minute reservations so we ended up having to sit outside for 2pm lunch on a Saturday. It was 18 degrees that day and despite their heating lamps, it was still quite cold however it wasn't terrible. For appetizer we started off with the pork cheeks. I HIGHLY recommend you get this, it was absolutely delicious. Perfect amount of fattiness, it was so good. The sauce it comes with was really good too! Next we had the crab fried rice and the steamed fish. The steamed fish was so soft and moist with excellent flavors of lime, garlic, and cilantro. It paired really well with some crab fried rice. We also got the crab curry, and the waitress warned us that it would be spicy however we underestimated her. It was actually REALLY spicy that I couldn't enjoy it too much. I felt the burn down to my stomach. They had happy hour until the end of their lunch service which was 5 pm. We ended up drinking a bunch of cocktails all of which were good! I would come back here to try other items off their menu!"
3359,"It was good, but I think it's a little overhyped. We got the fried zabb wings, pork cheeks, coconut crab curry, spicy beef dish, and coconut ice cream. The apps were really good. The chicken wings were very flavorful and crispy. The pork cheeks were tender versions of chasiu or chinese bbq pork. The coconut crab curry was so spicy. Beware of the spicy labels on the menu because it was indeed 3 chili signs of spice level. I couldn't finish it because it was so spicy. I think I drank the most water I've ever drunk at a restaurant lol. The ice cream was fine, nothing special. I'd get the zabb wings and try other dishes if I came back."
3360,"The food here is SO DELICIOUS and they do not disappoint with spiciness. Came here during happy hour for the oysters (dozen $18) which are super fresh and delicious, then ordered shrimp in 3 crab sauce as an appetizer bc I love raw shrimp dishes. So on point, it was very spicy even with my spice tolerance which I don't find at a lot of other restaurants. We also ordered Crab aob woosen and coconut crab curry - portions looked kinda small but it filled me up bc it was so spicy. Both were tasty but I liked the coconut crab curry more bc it was less generic. For dessert we got Coconut ice cream with egg yolk and ovaltine powder - at first I was like meh, it's just coconut ice cream which I can get anywhere but it turned out to be very special. The texture is insane and the hardened egg yolk goes so well with it. The food here is pricey so I wouldn't come here often but once in a while it's such a delicious treat!They have some outdoor seating kinda in booths - heater isn't super strong but it's sufficient. Service was amazing too!"
3361,"Wowowowowow. Came here for restaurant week 2022 and it did not disappoint. (Dinner restaurant week price $60/person).We came one hour after they opened and it was PACKED. Only available seating was at the bar and it was still a great experience and we were well taken care of.****I would suggest that you have a high tolerance for spice. From someone who loves spicy food, I did find myself drinking more water than usual hahah. ****I noticed that lemongrass is a key ingredient in most of their food. It has a strong flavor. If you don't like lemongrass, I wouldn't come here. 5/5 Complimentary app--shrimp chips with some crab meat on top. Tangy and good! Only available for restaurant week.7/5 Zabb wings. All I'm going to say is that I think this is the best wings I ever had at a restaurant. Just get it. No questions!! 4/5 Mussels. Chef's special ONLY for restaurant week. Sweet and sour. The broth was nice and salty. I wish I asked them not to clear it away so I can have it with my rice 8)4/5 coconut crab curry. What they are known for. So.....on the restaurant week menu, it didn't state the spice level and we ordered it based on the bartenders recommendation. my poor husband was having some difficulties.... (He doesn't have a high tolerance for spicy food). He did say it was good though. The flavor was smoky as well. I would have liked to see more crab but it's a great dish with rice. 3/5 ping gnob plaa. I appreciated how there weren't any bones. Lemongrass is quite strong in this dish. I thought it was okay. Nothing too outstanding in this dish. 10/10 Now the STAR DISHES from this place imo were the desserts. I'm not too good with sweets but the desserts just had the perfect amount of sweetness.Both the coconut icecream and the black sticky rice is worth ordering. I think those two desserts paired very nicely with each other. The black sticky rice is a warm dessert btw! I would definitely come back here again."
3362,"I haven't given a 5 stars on Yelp in a long time, and Fish Cheeks is highly deserving of this! I want to take all my friends and family here so we can order even more things to try :DThe star of the meal would be the fish, but before we get into that, you absolutely must get the oysters and the grilled pork cheeks. Happy hour pricing for the oysters is such a great deal too, $9 for 6! While the oysters were deliciously fresh, it's the side green sauce and fried shallots combination with the oysters that really brings out a spicy and refreshing slurp that will leave you wanting more orders (which is what we ended up doing!). Grilled pork cheeks ($17) is a perfect balance of meat to fat that the mouth feel wasn't greasy, but melty and tender enough that you're soon picking up the next pieces. For an appetizer, it's a good portion too, as I was definitely expecting only four pieces or so. Nice sear on them, with a spicy/sour sauce on the side that I didn't use much as the protein itself had a lot of flavor already. YummmSteamed Fish with Thai Herbs ($38): the best fish I've had in awhile! I love that it's deboned (there was still some on the side but that's fine) so it was such a smooth eating process without having to worry about accidentally choking. The fish itself is soo soft too. The soup that it's in is a bit like pickled cabbage fish in that it's sour, but it's very refreshing with all the herbs. It's served with the flame underneath it to keep it hot during the entire meal as well. Next time, I would definitely order either a crab fried rice or rice side dish to go with the fish, as towards the end, the soup did get a little too sour for my usual tastes, so some carbs would go well with that. But flavor and taste wise, absolutely delicious. Highly recommend!"
3363,"The grilled pork cheeks are divine. I will order these everytime I'm here. They are perfectly fatty and tender, and that Jeaw sauce added a punch of acidity and fish sauce-goodness. This dish is the perfect appetizer or complement to your beer/cocktail/life.Oysters with nam jim sauce was amazing. Another flavor blast.Fantastic happy hour deals everyday on cocktails, beer, and oysters from12-3:15 PM and 5-6PM.They give complementary shrimp chips + dip, which were excellent."
3364,"Service 5/5Food 5/5Ambiance 5/5Probably one of the best restaurants I have had an opportunity to eat at during my visit to NY this past week. Staff were exceptional! Our table never had dirty plates sitting around, water always full, and they always made sure to ask how we were doing. I highly recommend steamed fish with Thai herbs and coconut crab curry. It had flavors that I had never tasted in a traditional Thai restaurant. Made me really ponder how they were able to create such unique flavors! I'm definitely going to crave this spot!Ambiance/Atmosphere was lively as it was a packed house but a little bit cramped to my liking. But what do you expect in New York? Lol.Highly highly recommend this place to everyone visiting or living in NY."
3365,"Absolutely cannot wait to return to try the other dishes!Oysters for $1.5 for HH, they are on the thinner ends of the scale so you get another of meat there but the sauce and fried shallots give it a nice refreshing flavor than the common sauces.Zabb Wings - nice flavorful crunch on the outside with tender and moist meat underneath, would def order this again!Grilled pork cheeks - the sauce, amazing. It paired so well with the perfectly ratio of meat and fat.Manila clams - a good dish but the table wouldn't miss it if it wasn't there..Coconut crab curry - this is your go to if you're into a coconut curry, it had plenty of crab!! Definitely order this and if you can handle your spice.Prawn karee - I'm drooling just thinking about this one. The prawns were so juicy and plumpy! Sauce was on another level and innovative in a way for throwing eggs into it. Highly recommend.Khua Kling - be ready for your next visit on the toilet, the spice is wild on this one.. but flavors? Top notch, was it worth the bathroom visit? I'd say soCoconut ice cream - YES YES YES, we kept ordering more and more til we literally almost got kicked out, jk oopsCan't wait to come back!"
3366,"Came here for lunch when we were visiting New York and I am so happy we did. We made reservations for their Happy Hour beforehand and we got seated right away. We ordered:- market oysters- shrimp in 3 crab sauce (This is my favorite!) - grilled pork cheeks (This dish was ok. I could've done without this one)- Manila clams - coconut crab curry (This dish was delicious but it was also super spicy. I would not recommend this if you can't handle spicy food) This restaurant was one of my favorites in NY. I wish I got to order everything on the menu, but I was very happy with the plates that we got. Can't wait to come back and try more dishes in the future!"
3367,"My friend and I came by on a Friday night for dinner. We couldn't snag a reservation on resy since they book up soo fast but we were willing to wait. We got lucky and they squeezed us in after 20~ mins for indoor seating, yay! The seating was definitely a little tight though, probably because they're so popular rn and it was a weekend, lol.We heard such good things about so many dishes that we didn't know where to start. We decided on half a dozen oysters to start, the pork cheeks, coconut crab curry and prawn aob woosen which comes with glass noodles. And omg, not one dish disappointed! The oysters come with this cilantro sauce with a kick and fried shallots and it paired SOOO well. Unlike anything I had before. I also heard they are the first Thai restaurant to serve oysters so this is a must. I would come back just to order 2 dozens for myself. The pork cheeks were really tender and came with a great sauce also. The coconut crab curry was spicy but packed with flavor, crab and super creamy. Prawn aob woosen was also good- paired well with the garlicky glass noodles.So refreshing to see a new and different Thai restaurant in the city- I can't wait to come back and try more dishes!"
3368,"So here's the thing, I was reluctant to come here. In fact I had an attitude at the fact that I was being taken here to eat. Like, WHY would you bring me here. Whyyyyy?!!! *insert rolling eyes, pouty lips and trying to hide my attitude while speaking*A Sunday, I'm craving seafood. Came across this place, read the reviews and still was like no. Couldn't find another place & ended up here. Was told the wait was 90mins, yes 90 real mins (and that was to sit at the bar) Fine. Immediately stared walking around looking for another place to eat - your girl was hungry. 20 mins later, received a text ""your table is ready at the bar"". A miracle. So in their defense, the restaurant is small. I was also happy I sat at he bar because the tables are rather close to each other. The bartender, AMAZING, don't know his name but he was nice & fun, just good vibes. On to the food...the chicken wings has the major seasoning groups lol. A little bit of salt, spicy, sweet - very good. Next up, crab rice, no need to say anything else. Light, fluffy, crabby, so good and the accompanying two sauces made it taste better. Now, the star of the show, the herb steamed fish. *chefs kiss* A whole fish, NO bones, sitting in a broth of different herbs while being kept nice & toasty by a little fire underneath the dish it's served in. ANDDDDD when you add the fish herb sauce to the rice, it took the rice to another level!!! I wish I could buy a bottle of the herbed broth - so amazingly good. Because nothing is perfect, I did not like the portion sizes. The food is served family style & a little more food would be greatly appreciated because there's no way more than 2 people could share that rice or fish. Can't wait to return to try the pork cheeks, I'm a fan of it already & I haven't tried it yet!"
3369,"Probably my favorite Thai spot in the city!A lot of their dishes are on the spicy side, and even as someone who can take and enjoy lots of spice, it was a lot. But it didn't take away from the flavor or anything. We went during lunch and got oysters as part of their happy hour. There were crispy toppings given to put on top and it was a nice texture combination with the oysters. The coconut crab curry was also great - super creamy and leaned more toward the coconut flavor which chunks of crab in it. The steamed fish is also a must whenever I come! It's deboned and cooked so well. The soupy part is a nice touch and I also love the pickled vegetables that come with it. I took my friend who was visiting the city here and he absolutely loved the fish as well. The interior is also super pretty and has a cute ambiance. We usually go for lunch and walk in without a problem."
3370,"Just had dinner here last night and it truly exceeded my expectations!! Highly recommend getting a reservation during happy hour from 5-6pm, you can get a half dozen oysters for $9 and discounted drinks.Fish Cheeks' Thai cuisine is so unique, and I love all the fish decor. Even the bathroom sink handles are fish shaped!Jenna was our server and she was AMAZING, extremely attentive and so friendly. We started with a half dozen oysters, just $9 during Happy Hour. It was so fresh and flavorful that we had to get another round. For drinks, we got cocktails ($11), the Tongue & Cheek which is lychee flavored and the Pandan Gin Fizz (my boyfriend accidentally called it Pandan Gizz when ordering lol). We loved both drinks.For entrees, we got the popular Steamed Fish & Coconut Crab Curry. The Steamed Fish really knocked it out of the park for me. The Thai herbs made it so tangy and the fish was so soft, delicious, and juicy. They serve it to you with a little fire underneath to keep it hot for your entire meal. Don't miss out on the fish! The Coconut Crab Curry was too spicy for me to eat (my spice tolerance is low, so FYI to others if you can't handle spice, I wouldn't order this) but it was still very good; rich, creamy, but you can still taste the sweet crab flavor. I can't wait to come back and bring others to try this place!"
3371,"Ehh.  Mixed feelings about here. Came without a reservation on a Tuesday night during Restaurant week winter 2022.  Hostess was kind and was able to sit me inside.  Both inside and the outside shelter eating area are nice ! Inside you'll be sitting close to your neighbors but it's not cramped. Waiter was friendly and came over quickly with fresh cold water from a metal pitcher and the rest. week menu. I opted out of it bc I wasn't too hungry for a 3 course meal they were offering at 59 bucks. It was happy hour! So I got a drink and oysters for starters. The drink was a spicy mango margarita. I was disappointed. It was boring and no salt rim. The oysters didn't taste that fresh. And I wasn't a fan of the garlic chips nor the mignonette they served with it.  It was too overpowering for oysters but maybe bc it helps bc I don't think these were the best quality oysters. They were 1.5 each so the price was right. I ordered the famous crab curry. As I was waiting for it I've noticed all around me , free shrimp chips with a dip were given to patrons. None for me though! Is it bc I was dining solo I wondered. There goes another star. The crab curry was delicious! Very spicy so beware. I loved it nevertheless.  However , it's a small portion for a 30 dollar dish. I was eyeing this place for a while and I was sadly disappointed."
3372,"Tasty ThaiTried a few Thai places, so I didn't expect much here. Walking in, I really liked the interior light decor and, while the wait was a little long, the food was amazing. Every dish was different than anything I've had before, so I was definitely surprised. We ordered the Coconut Crab Curry (large chucks of crab, AMAZING CURRY!), Khua Kling (super spicy beef cuts), Steamed Fish w/ Thai Herbs (super tender, refreshing, my favorite), and the oysters (not bad). While elevated Southeast Asian cuisine doesn't always work, Fish Cheeks delivered--will be back to try more!"
3373,"fantastic experience, from the interior to the food to the service! the food: i got the oysters, clams, beef entree, and (not pictured) crab fried rice. wowow the oysters were amazing, i wish i had gotten a dozen, the sauce and fried shallot combo is unbelievable. everything was so perfectly seasoned, packed with flavor - my favorite was the oysters but the clams came a close second. the beef is spicy btw! the interior: fish themed everywhere, very cozy and warm. service: very attentive and kind workers, always kept my hot water filled!"
3374,"Came here for the happy hour oysters with my bf and his sister last weekend! She raved about the oysters and the delicious fried shallot topping so I knew we had to try it. She was correct! I LOVED the fried shallot and had never had this on a raw oyster before. They don't use the regular cocktail sauce, but this was even better. We got two dozen to share but ended to getting one more dozen hahah. We didn't try any of their other dishes, but I do want to come back to try their fish dishes! And of course get more oysters!"

3376,"Coconut Crab Curry was SPICY AF. I can handle spice, and even this was spicy for me. My other two companions felt the same way. Everything else was great. The prawns with vermicelli was my favorite. The portion, however, was underwhelming- it's enough for a few bites each when shared with 3 people. Husband really loved the Tom Yum soup. We all like the crab fried rice. Morning glory dish was yum too! My only complaint is that the coconut crab curry was SPICY AF and I feel the waitress should have mentioned it to us. When I complained about it, she dismissed my complaint and said that it had two chili signs next to it on the menu. Just beware when ordering that crab curry. The Thai Iced Teas are $8 here. I'm from LA, and I'm not used the seeing $8 Thai Iced Tea ever lol. That is all."
3377,"It's amazing.  the crab fried rice is so worth it.I think every was great. Would come back for more! DroolsThe crab curry rice was really good too!I personally have issues w curry (spice induced diarrhea) not the restaurant fault, only my body doesn't work well with spices. Hahaha"
3378,"The food was obviously wonderful here, but we walked away most excited about Fish Cheeks' cocktail program. Tried four among us and all were good, most were excellent. My personal favorite was the Thank You Kha (white rum, coconut, galangal, ginger, lemongrass, makrut lime, and chili oil drops). It had a rather complex and completely unique floral/herbal flavor profile and was very well balanced. Also enjoyed the Spicy Mango with tequila, mango, lime, and Thai bird's eye chili, which had a certain richness to it that was faintly reminiscent of a mango lassi and had this complementary tropical fruitiness and spiciness. The oysters were notable for their namJin seafood sauce, which is a bit like a mignonette sauce but has a fish sauce note.We split two main courses: the crab fried rice and rainbow trout pad cha. The fried rice had a very light but pleasant flavor and also came with two sauces, including the nam jin. The rainbow trout (fillet trout, habanero chili, acacia leaf, green bean, ginger root, basil and green peppercorn served with rice) dish was spicy, slightly sour, and had a light sweetness. The sauce is mildly addictive. A note about the spice levels here: the menu includes the spice level of each item, from 0 - 3 chili peppers. The trout had one chili and I found it pretty spicy. The table beside us ordered something with 3 chilis and they couldn't finish it and seemed to be in pain. So take care."
3379,"Stopped in for restaurant week and we were quickly seated despite being 10 min late for our reservation. Nice trendy ambiance, poor acoustics so you'll just hear everyone else yelling around you and not the person across from you lol. We decided to go with the restaurant week menu and tried the mussels, crispy rice salad, branzino, coconut crab curry, and sticky rice dessert. Everything was flavorful and good though the crab curry didn't really live up to the hype. It was pretty spicy which overwhelmed the dish and crab chunks were few. The crispy rice salad and sticky rice dessert were both really good and delicious!"
3380,"This was my first time here and it was such a nice surprise. We went there during happy hour (5-6pm/ all week), we ordered half a dozen oysters and some wine to start. The oysters were very fresh, it came with fried shallot and Thai Nam Jim seafood dipping sauce. We ordered two entrees: coconut crab curry and steamed fish with herbs. I'm not a huge fan of Thai curry, but I actually like this dish. It's spicier than what you expected but in a good way. The crab meat is cooked perfectly as well. My favorite dish of the night had to be the steamed fish with herbs, it just had a good combo of sourness and spiciness. The fish meat was fresh and tender, very flavorful. The sauce they made was just amazing. I would totally go back just for the steamed fish. The restaurant is very busy so definitely make a reservation before you go. They also have outdoor seating area as well with heat lamps installed."
3381,"The ambiance and decor are great, as is the service, but the food is severely overhyped. I swung by Fish Cheeks yesterday evening with a friend without realizing it's Restaurant Week. We were able to share one order of the restaurant week offering ($59 only, which is actually a good deal split between two people) but they required us to order another main dish (~$30)--still cheaper than ordering two restaurant week options and ending up with too much food! My friend and I opted for the chicken wings, the crab fried rice, the coconut crab curry, and the coconut ice cream. Here are my thoughts:* Chicken wings: kinda whatever. I'm not a chicken wing person and found these to be unmemorable. * Crab fried rice: very tasty, big fan of this. But this is a hard dish to mess up, and at $30, it's a bit more expensive than other NY. Thai staples (namely Glur + Thai Villa)* Coconut crab curry. Incredibly memorable in the absolute worst of ways. Yes, you read that right. In my opinion the waiters should give diners a warning upon ordering this dish because the spice level is frankly quite dangerous. I am not a fan of spicy food but I can handle mild spice (which is better than many!); that said, this dish made me physically ill. I literally had to run to the restroom mid-meal because it made me sick. The first flavors that hit your palate are delicious but a millisecond later you'll feel like you're in danger. Tongue in flames, spitting fire, almost gasping for air. We had to ask our waitress for some yogurt (which they do not have, but she was kind enough to serve us a Thai iced tea to help us out). Even with that though, we couldn't handle it and had to box the rest. I genuinely thought that perhaps accompanied by some Greek yogurt it would be okay, but I was sorely mistaken. I had to stop eating the leftovers entirely because I once again started to feel queasy. I am even developing a headache now. Some may think I'm being melodramatic but I promise you I am not. This dish is seriously no joke and coming from a person who can handle at least some degree of spice, this is saying something! I implore Fish Cheeks to start notifying diners about this, or at least providing some sort of spice level option because I think this dish has incredible potential sans the ridiculous spice level. And if anyone from Fish Cheeks is reading this, please let me know if you ever take this advice as I'd love to come back, give this dish another try, and update my review!Coconut ice cream: I was shocked by how much I loved this. I am not an ice cream person but this blew my mind. Coconut pieces, egg yolk, and ovaltine--who'd have thought!? Love it. Would order this even on its own if I'm ever around.I didn't try any drinks yesterday but their menu is fascinating with lots of seemingly delicious options. So, in summary, the coconut crab curry ruined the night for me. I really hope the restaurant team will take my recommendation into consideration though because I truly believe I'd order from + dine at Fish Cheeks fairly regularly if the spice could be adjusted down here. I just can't let myself eat that curry dish again in its current state because I've already suffered enough GI problems as a result. That said, I really appreciate the attentive service and I love the ambiance. Their happy hour sounds like an incredible deal ($11 cocktails, heavily discounted oysters) so that sounds like a safer bet for me moving forward."
3382,"Cute establishment. Very flavourful. Oysters, clams, waterspinach, wings, the cilantro lime fish is all a must. Homemade ice cream...delishPrice is high, portions are small. Good service. Location is a lil out of the way. Mos def one of the better thai restaurants in nyc."
3383,"Table of 3. Normal go-to is steamed fish but decided to try fried and it was well worth the try. Satisfying and well done.Crab curry was a bit weak compared to expectations given that it was highly recommended. Spicy. Saltier dish, but that's expected for curry.Morning glory has a kick but very satisfying and a great accompaniment to the fish.Coconut ice cream and pumpkin custard desserts were loved by the table. Pumpkin custard was warm and comforting. Coconut ice cream with Ovaltine was fun and delightful."
3384,"5 stars for the thai food on the menu, please skip the oysters. The fried shallots were not super fresh, and the sauce pairing was weak, and the oysters were just average on the freshness scale.Now onto the food. I'm convinced this is the best crab curry in the city. Slightly spicy but with just the perfect amount of spice, the crab curry (5/5) has well-rounded flavors and a generous serving of seafood. At $30, it's a bit pricey but you get what you paid forPork Cheeks (5/5): The pork cheeks here has changed my mind about cuts of pork. I place this on par or above pork belly. The sauce pairing was exceptional as well, bringing out the light flavor of the pork cheek itself. Overall definitely worth. Happy hour drinks are standard for a thai establishment and nothing to die for"
3385,"11/10 for food, service and all around a good timeFood was cooked perfectly, and thats coming from someone who can't handle spice and yet still wanted more because the food tasted so good. The flavor combinations of everything was delicious and those wings are a MUST- sweet, spicy and a perfect crunch! The Potak is good if you like fish sauce smell/taste, similar to Tom Yum in terms of flavor and smell. The coconut crab curry was a hit or miss with our group but if you like peanuts and crab, this is perfect for you - it is spicy though! The desserts were done well and with such skill. The pumpkin custard was an actual pumpkin that you could eat whole and the strings on top were candied egg yolk! Go check out Fish Cheeks!"
3386,"tl;dr: Highly recommend you come with a large group (or be prepared for leftovers) as the flavour profile of each entree is slightly unbalanced on its own but creates a delicious harmony when paired with other dishes. And get the pork cheeks.My friend brought me here as this is one of her favorite places for Thai food in Manhattan. We made reservations for 5:45pm on a Wednesday--right at the end of their happy hour so we got their cocktails and oysters. Oysters were alright, and their cocktails are pretty strong. The tongue & cheek was probably my favorite.To start we also ordered the pork cheeks and the zabb wings. The pork cheeks were so flavourful, and somehow both soft and crispy--for sure a must-order. I also really liked the lime-forward flavour in the zabb wings, but in general I'm not a fan of dry rub wings and found myself wanting a dip on the side.The entrees are called kub khao (plates to share), and I can see why. We got the coconut crab curry, crab fried rice, and steamed fish. Each dish leaned heavily towards one flavour: the curry was super spicy, the fried rice was salty, and the steamed fish was very sour from all the lime. Independently I probably would've found each of them to be too overpowering, but eating all 3 together created more of a balance and had me appreciating the aspects of each individual dish more. The one exception would probably be the rice which I still found to be too salty--I ended up mixing it with some plain white rice to make it more palatable. Also a warning that I thought I had a high spice tolerance, but that crab curry really put me and my stomach through it--order at your own risk.Throughout our visit service was friendly and prompt, and despite ordering so much and the place being busy, our dishes came out quick. Definitely hope to come again!"
3387,"This review is a bit old but hopefully still relevant!I do not like spicy food that much... But when I say this place is so good that I will go through the pain of the spice just to eat it... I hope it means a lot lolThe special appetizer sounded and was amazing! It was raw hamachi topped with a sweetish sauce with fresh vegetables on top! It wasn't spicy and was super fresh! The pork cheeks are a MUST order, they're super tender and just jam packed full of flavor! Sauce is a bit spicy but not too bad :) really brings out the flavors in the pork cheeks!Raw Shrimp with a spicy seafood sauce. This was a dish I couldn't stop eating even though my mouth couldn't hand it !! I tried picking out as much chili and seeds as I could but it was so delicious!! The seafood sauce had a kick to it but it works well with the raw shrimp which was plump, soft and kinds chewy. I would totally come back for this dish!! So GOOOOOD!The crab fried rice is probably one of the best I've ever had! Lots of crab huge meat and perfectly cooked fried rice! A nice carb on the side that isnt spicy to balance out all the flavors (imo)I love this place !!!! Totally would recommend and would come back for that raw shrimp dish"
3388,"Had a great meal here! Came with a group of 4, we were seated promptly with our reservation, it's a bit tight seating with the tables all super close together but still comfortable! We had a few different things to try and everything was really good! Worth noting that everything is pretty spicy so something with multiple chilis next to them should be noted! The drinks were awesome and I would order every dish again! Our server was also very nice and helpful."
3389,"We celebrated my friend's bday here and then I brought my husband here again. The food is exquisite with the staff being so welcoming and accommodating. I've tried the chicken wings, the Crab curry, crab fried rice and the fish with Thai herbs. All are so delicious especially if you enjoy lime flavors.A little bit on the pricier side but def worth it for those meals that you would prefer to be memorable."
3390,"Fish cheeks tops all the Thai restaurants I've been to in NYC! The flavors are incredible and you simply won't be able to order many of these dishes in another generic Thai restaurant. Truly, I'm a picky eater but everything is perfect. The zabb chicken wings has it all: a dry rub with some sourness and packed with some heat. It's my ONE favorite chickens wings in all of NY.The entrees are quite impressive too. I'd recommend prawn karee with its thick garlic sauce. But you can't go wrong with po tak (which had so much seafood packed in sour and spicy broth) and crab fried rice (a classic that didn't fail)."
3391,"Make reservations online ahead of time because wait times otherwise are long and it can be hard to get a table. Fish cheeks lived up to the hype and I loved every dish my table of 4 tried. The cocktails were also great! It was a pricey meal (over $100 pp including drinks, tax and tip) but the food was worth it!"
3392,"So I really wanted to love this place. The menu looked great, photos of the decor were cute, and it just looked like an overall cool spot in the city. I'll start by saying the spot is cute. Indoor decor was really nice, small, intimate. But... they only have one bathroom. Might sound like I'm being nit-picky but for such a popular place on a crowded evening when drinks are flowing.... It's annoying to stand in a small restaurant waiting in line for a single bathroom.As for food & drinks. The happy hour is a really good deal. The oysters were good and I had this Spicy Mango drink (wasn't spicy at all) that was pretty tasty. Food - I was disappointed. For the price per plate I was expecting a burst of Thai flavor and spices. I ordered the crab fried rice and it couldn't survive without the two side sauces in came with. I thought the portions would be big, but one entree and appetizer is not enough for a party of two so again - not really understanding the price point. Maybe it's because they're seafood dishes? idk. Overall, I'd go back for happy hour, but not the food."
3393,"This was hands down one of my favorite meals during my last visit to New York! My friend and I stopped by for lunch on a Monday around 12:30 pm and the place was pretty packed. They have happy hour from 12-3:15 pm daily so we definitely took advantage of their oyster specials which are $18 for a dozen.  We started off with a dozen oysters, grilled pork cheeks, pakboong fai dang (morning glory), and their coconut crab curry.  The oysters come with their nam jim seafood sauce and fried shallots and were AMAZING! Oysters were super fresh and the sauce and shallots were such an amazing combo.  We couldn't get enough of it!  Next, the grilled pork cheeks came out and we were blown away with how tender and perfect these pieces of pork cheeks were.  It came with jeaw sauce and it was the ultimate flavor combination with the pork cheeks. So so good!  The morning glory was also really tasty and was great to eat with our meal.  Finally, our coconut crab curry came out and it was absolutey divine.  It had nice chunks of crab in the curry and the flavors were on point.  We ended up ordering an extra dozen oysters because it was so delicious.I wish I could've came here one more time to eat during my trip but we didn't have the time. This is definitely one of my top restaurants in NY and I can't wait to make a trip back just so I can come visit Fish Cheeks again."
3394,"We made reservations far in advance, although it seems there were lots of bar walk-ins. Everything we ordered was delicious-- pork cheek, po tak soup, crab curry and the fried snapper. Our waitress was not the most friendly, so that's how good the food was! Beware of spice.. and half of us had to rush to the bathroom soon after. The iron stomachs did not"
3395,"I don't even remember how many times I have been here.Never disappoint me and my friends Foods, drinks and wait staff....A bit pricy compared to other Thai restaurants in the city but it has its own perks Everything is perfectly done. I would recommend to try Grilled Pork Cheeks and Crab Fried Rice."
3396,"The food at Fish Cheeks was phenomenal. But reader, be warned: the Kua Kling packs heat like an oven door.We ordered the Zaab wings, the Pakboong Fai Dang, the Coconut Crab Curry, and the Khua Kling.Someone else described the Zaab wings as 'Thai dorito-style.' They are coated with a savory and citrusy dry rub. Now, dry-rub wings can be dangerous. If the chicken is overcooked, the dish becomes unbearably dry; you really want some kind of a sticky wet sauce to compensate (like blue cheese or ranch). And the Zaab wings arrive unaccompanied. That's bold. But they absolutely pulled off the solo mission. They were exquisitely juicy and tender.The Pakboong Fai Dang was stellar. Truly a must order. It's garlicky, aromatic, and packed with classic Thai flavors.The Coconut Crab Curry was creamy, rich, and not overly fishy, but still tasted crabby. I'd definitely order it again.Last, the Kua Kling. Spiceheads, rejoice; all others, be wary. The Kua Kling will tingle the roof of your mouth and dampen your hairline.My wife and I had to order an emergency glass of thai iced tea (also delicious) to soothe our tongues. We are no strangers to spice. We almost always order our food ""thai spicy."" But the Kua Kling is potent. The three pepper symbols on the menu almost don't do it justice.Overall, the off the menu stuff was fine. The service was pretty standard. And I'll admit, the décor inside is not particularly chic or trendy. I think it's fair to call it 'no frills.'But so long as you are simply looking for tasty Thai food, you will find it here in abundance."
3397,Loved the seafood options! The shrimp in 3 crab sauce was amazingly good. The citrus and chili really go well together. I could easily eat multiple servings of it. The coconut crab curry and crab fried rice was well recommended as the fan favorites. They both had generous lumps of crab but flavor wise was quite standard. The whole fish steamed fish was by far the best part of our meal there. Just the presentation was very impressive and the fish is so fresh and well cooked. The citrus flavors work really well in everything. Will be returning!
3398,"I have only lived in NYC for a couple months. Almost all of my meals have been incredible. This one was top 3 EASY. May be numero uno. Anyway. It's not your standard pad thai joint. These are classy meals fam. We got the steamed fish and the prawn karee. IDK about yall but steamed fish does not jump off the page to me, but thank zeus for my girlfriend because it was fire flames you guys. Fire flames. Then the star of the show was the prawn karee. Holy crustaceans the sauce this was in was the most exceptional mixture of tangy, spicy, and savory. I would drink that thick slurry if not for my already tenuous status as a sane person. Would have loved for that prawn to have been peeled already as I used 5 napkins for the job, but it was a small price to pay for possibly my favorite dish in NY to date. Staff was also high quality."
3399,"By far my favorite Thai place in the city. It's very different from any other Thai restaurant I've been to as they specialize in very fresh fish and seafood. The fish is the star of the show!! The restaurant is also very cozy with a nice ambiance. You have to get the grilled Branzino, the sauce they pair it with is to die for."
3400,"This may be one of the best meals I have ever eaten!Every single thing we ordered was so intentionally and expertly prepared.Typically, it can be hard to secure a table for dinner at FC, but we stopped by for lunch on a random Thursday and got a table right away.Turns out, every week day lunch time is HAPPY HOUR, where specialty cocktails are $11 and oysters are $1.50 a piece.We picked out a cocktail, ordered 6 oysters, the pork cheek, a steamed fish, 6 more oysters, and finally, a coconut ice cream for dessertFirst, the oysters were INCREDIBLE.  I was going to take a pass, but the garlic/cilantro and fried onion topping was a game changer.  I live in Maine and these were the BEST oysters I have ever had!The pork cheek was in-your-dreams tender and came with an excellent tamarind sauceThe steamed fish was beyond!  It came in a dish with a heating element below which kept the sauce bubbling.  It was cooked in the most delicious lemongrass, garlic and chili sauce, it was SO SO good.  Pro tip: definitely ask for rice on the side, you will not necessarily want, but NEED this!I was really on the fence about dessert, but we decided to share.  The made in house coconut ice cream drizzled with a sweet egg yolk sauce was everything you might imagine it would be.THANK YOU Fish Cheeks!We're back at the apartment and STILL talking about our lunch today!"
3401,"We went here at 12pm Sunday and booked reservations just to be safe, after seeing some people waiting a few hours for a table during dinner time. It's also beneficial to go here for lunch as they have happy hour for oysters and drinks at a discount. We got the Somtum Corn Salad and half dozen oysters to start. The corn salad has great sauce that is slightly spicy yet refreshing. The oysters have accompaniments that are more unique and Thai-inspired versus the stereotypical horseradish etc. I greatly prefer these accompaniments honestly, especially the fried shallots which gave nice flavor but did not mask the fresh oyster flavor. It also converted my friend to loving oysters.Then, we got the popular coconut crab curry and steamed fish. Coconut crab curry features huge chunks of crab meat and the sauce is quite spicy. The rice is not a lot for the amount of curry they give, which is alright because the dish is what matters most. Steamed fish is pretty good with lots of lime and Thai spices. Service here is solid with consistent replacements of empty water jugs. The meal can get pricey really really fast so just be careful, but it's mostly worth it as the seafood is very fresh and a Thai friend vouched for this place so it's legit."
3402,"Good vibes, good food, good service. Not the greatest thai restaurant in NYC, but it was still very nice.My friend and I went on a busy saturday night without a reservation, and luckily enough, we got a seat at the bar just when we walked in. Don't try your luck, though, because the wait can be hours long.We split the basil clams and coconut crab curry. Both were really yummy and had a nice spiciness to them--the curry was one of their most popular dishes and was a bit spicier, nothing overpowering though. The clams were a ""snack"" size but were tastier than the curry, in my opinion. I just wish the curry was bigger given its price--$30 for one bowl with a side of rice--as well as its advertisement as a ""shareable"" dish.... Either don't come here super hungry, or plan on having a ""shareable"" plate by yourself.We also got the 2 for $20 ""She Fell Off the Boat"" shots. It came with two vodka shots infused with their medicine block herbs (nice and floral), as well as some pickled mango and pan dan tea as a chaser. These were great, and I'd highly recommend!! Note: if you're looking for a more elegant cocktail, the ""Tongue In Cheek"" was super popular."
3403,"Fish Cheeks is my favorite Thai place in NYC. I've only been here twice, but from my first visit I've been compelled to order the wings and corn salad to start. The wings are seasoned in this sweet, salty, sour, spicy seasoning that they sell in a bottle, and are freshly fried! The corn salad is very refreshing and so different from anything you could order anywhere else!During my last visit, I ordered the whole fried fish and a prawn dish with glass noodles - both were really good and I appreciated that the fish was deboned and a pretty substantial portion. Although the prawn dish was good, I couldn't help but feel that the serving size was a bit underwhelming for the price. I am always recommending Fish Cheeks to others when they want a Thai food recommendation, with the added note that they do not make pad thai. However, I don't see that as a flaw and will come back again for sure."
3404,"I'm really torn on how to rate Fish Cheeks. I have been wanting to try this place for ages, and I don't know how much I actually enjoyed it, but I also think I don't know enough about this style of authentic Thai food to judge. So I'll just share my impressions!Ambience: the inside is adorable. We ate outside. Outdoor seating is sectioned off by plexiglass, comfortable benches, warm heaters overhead, and you're offered blankets. Couldn't be more comfortable even on a frigid day.Service: a little patchy. I got the sense they were short-staffed, i waited about 10 minutes at reception to be able to get our (reserved) table, and at one point we basically had to chase the server down in desperate need of water. They also kept trying to clear plates we were still eating from, which was a little frustrating. But everyone was very gracious and kind! The important thing, though, is the food! Drinks: We shared the first drink on the menu (has hibiscus, black sesame, etc). Super beautiful and very yummy! Neither of us are big drinkers but I can tell this would be a fun cocktail spot.  We also later ordered a thai iced tea out of sheer spice desperation, which was basically extortion at $8 but also delicious. Apps: We had the clams with Thai basil and the zabb wings. The clams themselves were too fishy for my taste. Some were tasty, but I got some that were just so intensely briny and ocean-y that I couldn't get them down. They were also rubbery in texture. The curry they were in, though, was exquisite. I could have drunk it, and I did. The zabb wings were so delicious. Perfectly cooked, tender meat, and that seasoning blend was just incredible! However I do want to note that one of the wings wasn't cleaned properly--I found a few pinfeathers in mine! I also couldn't get the server's attention to let her know, and then someone else came and cleared the table. We also got a complimentary snack of shrimp chips (yummy, crunchy) and a sadly tiny portion of delicious chili jam to dip them in--I wish there'd been more of this tasty stuff!For our main, we split the famous crab curry. I get the sense from reading other reviews that the spice level on this dish may vary from time to time. My companion and I (who are both very adventurous eaters) agreed this was the single spiciest dish either of us had eaten, spicy enough that it caused some pretty serious physical pain to eat it. I wish they'd toned it down, because it was also maybe the most delicious curry I've ever eaten, and I kept eating more even though it was making me cry! The crab portion was generous, but honestly the protein was an afterthought for me--it was all about that flavorful, perfectly creamy sauce. My companion talked me into dessert, and we split the coconut sundae. It was very tasty, though I found the inclusion of an egg yolk a little peculiar and not very appetizing. The ice cream itself was lovely.We came during restaurant week, but did not order off that menu--I'll note that the restaurant week special is not much of a savings at Fish Cheeks, which is unfortunately the case at an increasing number of restaurants. Our bill came to about $60 each including tax and tip. All in all, it's hard for me to say what I think of this restaurant! Certainly, the flavors were superb, but there were also a couple of missteps that surprised me at this price point. Overall, though, it was definitely a really unique experience and great fun to try a new combination of flavors and ingredients."
3405,"Dinner was overall really good! The flavors definitely hit the sweet, sour, spicy, and bitter spectrum. Grilled Pork Cheeks: MUST MUST HAVE! The pork is cooked to perfection and the meat glistens! The fat to meat ratio is also really well balanced. Crunch on the inside, juicy on the outside. The sauce drizzled on top really sealed the deal. Fried Fish: The fish is fried to perfection, not too fried/greasy, but not soggy either. The herb salad was def a good balance. Def. a must try! Crab Fried Rice: The fried rice was good. I'd probably not go for this dish again because it was just a regular fried rice, with crab meat. I'd def. try out the curry next time. A place to def. try out! The vibes were great as well. Def. hit them up for happy hour!"
3406,"One of THE BEST Thai food restaurants in NYC. The food is so fresh & seafood focused, but you must order the Zabb wings too. Everything is incredible! We ordered:Steamed Fish with Thai Herbs Zabb WingsHappy Hour Oysters ($18/dozen)Outdoor seating is super cute too. Bonus that I've spot a celeb there or walking by every time I've gone haha (last time it was Liev Schreiber)!"
3407,"I think this is as authentic as you can get for Thai cuisine. Recommended by a friend, I have had this spot bookmarked for the longest time and just happened to be in the area with my gf looking for a lunch spot.The staff members were pretty accommodating as we got a table inside that was in the middle of the dining area and was able to switch seats with another table that just cleared against the wall. They were able to give some recommendations based off of what was popular. We started off with drinks, including a Leo Lager Beer at HH pricing ($6) and Thai Iced Coffee ($8), delicious if I may add.For entrees, we ordered the Rainbow Trout Pad Cha ($27) and the Coconut Crab Curry ($30). The Coconut Crab Curry had two peppers next to it on the menu and they were not messing around when it comes to spicy. I love spicy, but I underestimated how spicy it could have been. The crab meats is what makes it all worth it and taking a spoonful of the curry and dumping it onto the bowl of rice. The Rainbow Trout dish is unique I don't think you can find at many Thai restaurant. Carefully filleted as much as possible, although you may encounter some bones, so you've been warned. Seasoned very well with myriad of spices and obviously it was delicious.We ended our meal with Mango Sticky Rice ($13). I think it tastes better without the coconut cream?, but regardless, one of the greatest ways to end a meal. You get that natural sweetness from the mango combined with the sticky rice to add to the flavor (and coconut if you choose to do that)."
3408,"Came here for dinner on a Saturday. Fortunately at 5 pm they take walk ins. While waiting on line, I even had a celebrity sighting...Liev Schreiber! Now onto the food...my party of 3 shared 2 dozen oysters, the pork cheeks, the hamachi ceviche, the Thai steamed fish, and a side of morning glory. I also ordered the Pandan Gin Fizz. All in all the food was very good. The oysters were a bit on the smaller size (maybe not oyster season?) and the steamed fish was very flavorful and de-boned! The service was exceptional and every now and then you see the fire from the flambé in the kitchen which was fun! Only downside is there is only one bathroom :( which can take quite a while considering both indoor and outdoor dining at capacity, but c'est la vie. Recommend for everyone to try. Would like to try more of the crabby stuff next time!"
3409,"I am so mad at myself for discovering this gem after moving out of NY. This easily would be one of my favorite restaurants in NY. It's a tiny place, but they have outdoor seating that could fit our party of 10. Let's talk about the food.Grilled Pork Cheeks: MUST HAVE! These cheeks are the best cheeks I've ever had! It's a good amount to share with two or three people, but I could probably eat two just by myself. Zabb Wings: MUST HAVE! The seasoning is crack! Which they sell btw. It's cooked to perfection. Crunchy on the inside, juicy on the outside. Yum!!! Get it. Crab Fried Rice: it was good. I'd probably get it again cause I'm a sucker for crab fried rice, but it's not a must-have. Friendly reminder, GET THE CHEEKS.Steamed Branzino: it was interesting. Lol the flavor was on the sour side, but it was good. I liked it, but I would try the grilled one next time. Coconut Crab Curry: IT'S SPICY! I'd say at a level 4 out of 5. I couldn't even eat more than two spoons of it. I wouldn't get it again. I'm so sad I wouldn't be able to eat here again until I go back to NY the next time. So go eat there for me!!! YOU MUST GO HERE!"
3410,"Had theeee most amazing dinner celebrating my boyfriend's 30th. Service was absolutely exceptional the entire night, our waiter was so attentive and fun, she really made sure we enjoyed ourselves. The cocktails were delicious, I definitely recommend the Seoul mule and the Busanhaeng. Every dish was fantastic, we also added the baby banana and the sea urchin. I honestly can't even think of what dishes were the best because everything truly tasted delicious. I don't like beets much and even the beets with scallops were amazing. The fried octopus was definitely up there, first time I've ever had it friend before. All in all a great dining experience and we both left with our stomachs full and hearts happy :)"
3411,"My first Two Michelin Star experience...it was amazing! There's a lot I can say but here were the things that impressed me most:1. The service. Everything is like a well oiled machine/well rehearsed choreography. The coordination that the servers put and the expertise with which they know the food, pretty impressed.2. My standout dishes were the octopus, banchan, and the kimbap. The banchan were so exciting and bursting with diverse and interesting flavor combinations. I loved the crispiness and slight heat that the octopus brought. The kimbap was so good, so crunchy and fun to eat, great balance of flavors.3. The baby banana!!!! Ok I did not realize it wasn't a real banana so when they brought the fruit basket I grabbed the banana too fast and broke it. Oops! It tasted really good, like a smooth banana cream. 4. Overall, the experience was really enjoyable and I got to dine in a way that I've never been able to. Would recommend if you have $300 to spend and want to eat some extremely fresh food."
3412,"Was hyped to come here after hearing about this place from literally everywhere. Unfortunately, the experience did not live up to the hype.Jungsik is a boutique, high-class restaurant situated in a quiet, cobblestone-clad road in Tribeca. The ambiance is quite dim, and the restaurant is rather quiet. There are 3 sections in the restaurant: 1) the bar and waiting area, 2) a main area with a middle service station and tables surrounding it, 3) another square room, but this time with only tables, along the outskirts, and a table in the middle.For the food, the amount of food is around average, not super stuffing. You start out with some bites from the kitchen, on their signature white mini-pedestals. These are decent, although they are quite compact, so it can be hard to pick out all the flavors in one bite.The next course was a lobster with some creamy sauce, osetra caviar-topped and some microgreens. It's good, and probably my favorite part of the meal. Caviar portion is medium, wish there was a bit more.Then, came some beets on top of raw scallop. I think the intention was for this dish to have delicate flavors, but I felt like the portion was so small, and the flavors so ""subtle,"" that I didn't really get much out of this. Forgettable for me. The crown of Jungsik is their octopus dish, which I was excited to try. The octopus leg portion is quite sizeable, and the texture on it is very crispy. The meat inside is quite tender, and has some deep, long-lasting flavor to it. Sauce is a nice spicy touch to it. This was another strong dish -- wish more of the dishes treated me with such quantity and quality. If anything, the octopus was a bit salty, and I felt like that for the rest of the meal.The black cod came next, in a semi-sweet glaze, and rested on top of a foam. This was a decent dish as well. Loved the fatty cod fish meat. Then, the meal started to go a bit south...we got the tuna kimbap. I may be understating the complexity of the dish, but it's just kimbap with your typical ingredients in a tuna roll. The main issue for the dish for me was the overwhelming truffle flavor on it. I can only speculate, but the mustard sauce seemed to have truffle bits in it, but the worst part for me was that the seaweed wrapping the kimbap smelled and tasted like it was deep-fried in truffle oil. I love truffle, but THIS much truffle was even too much for me. There wasn't a whole lot of balance to this dish, and it felt like munching through a thick wall one-dimensional wall of crunchy truffle with truffle sauce and truffle-overpowered insides.Right after the tuna kimbap, came lamb...with a side of truffle slices on rice, kinda like a truffle nigiri. The lamb itself was pretty good. Tasted almost like ham, and was cooked very delicately and precisely. The truffle was...just too much, especially having an all-truffle dish in the tuna kimbap from before. Also, there were only 3 (or maybe 4) slices of truffle on the rice...just felt a bit stingy there.Then came a short dessert program, aka one dish, with some chocolates to follow. It's not bad, but not amazing and I wish this could be longer as well.Is this fine dining? Yes. But for me, I can't say the food was necessarily consistently good and impressive throughout the night, and besides the octopus, I never felt like I was really being treated. There was never really display of opulence, and for the price tag and reputation, you'd expect something of that level. The memes that poke at fine dining establishments giving out miniscule amounts of food was exemplified during my experience.As I alluded earlier, the truffle notes in the dishes were way too strong, and the dishes were on the saltier side. I understand that having a wine pairing would probably cut through some of the salt and truffle, but the beverage pairing is meant to elevate the flavors, not save them from being too heavy; the food by itself should be great. I don't think that wine should be an antidote for flavor imbalances.At the end, only my girlfriend was given a menu, and I wasn't. I understand that we were celebrating her birthday, but is it really that hard to give out an extra menu? (and isn't it standard to give out menus anyway at this level?)Overall, sickly overpowering truffle and unbalanced flavors (too salty), redundant themes, no feeling of opulence as certain portions were quite small, and inconsistent service made this experience hit well below expectations."
3413,"This was absolutely the most expensive meal I've ever had the privilege to eat in my entire life. We did the 7 course tasting menu with extra dishes. I can't eat any fish, but they accommodated me by replacing all my fish dishes with meat. The food didn't totally fill me up, but everything was made with such thoughtfulness and precision. My favorite was the octopus dish. I don't know if I will ever be wealthy enough to say a meal this pricey is ""worth it,"" but that was some darn good food. Our head server was Susan, who was excellent. All the staff are impeccable and service was top notch. Also, the bathroom toilet has a cool mechanism where it can spray hot water to clean you."
3414,"Jungsik was impeccable! My boyfriend and I celebrated our anniversary here, and it totally lived up to our expectations. Service was flawless. We started with the Yugin and Busanhaeng cocktails, which were both fantastic. The tasting was absolutely amazing - my favorite courses were the banchan, kimbap and scallop. We also added the baby banana dessert (do not miss that) and one order of iberico ham. Organic balhyo tea was perfect with dessert. Our final round of drinks (towards the end I ordered the au lait cocktail, which was like a dessert in itself) were delayed, so they comped them for us. I was impressed fromstart to finish!!"
3415,"Looking for Michelin star? Is it your first Michelin star? Jungsik is the one! Best experience ever.We made reservation for our anniversary and it was the best decision ever. We booked their outdoor dining cabin. Let me tell you! Jungsik's outdoor dining cabin was phenomenal and thoughtful. They definitely put in a lot of time, money and effort in their outdoor space. Comfort - 10/10Sound proof - 10/10Outdoor heating - 10/10 - so hot; it was burning my face lol!Omg! The food presentation was aesthetically pleasing and beautiful. Food was delicious! Every dish was burst with so many luscious flavors. My taste palate was in heaven. Dessert was amazing! Mmm, so goood!Jungsik's baby banana! It's a must try! And a work of art. You won't regret, I promise! White chocolate shell, garnished with cocoa powder on the outside.   Banana cream, banana cake, and dulce cream on the inside (I believe). Yumm!Customer service was amazing! Staff was so nice and friendly. Fun and interactive. We brought our dog to dinner with us. The waiter was so thoughtful; he brought a water bowl for our dog :)If I have a travel machine, I would like to go back in time and experience Jungsik's all over again and again, and again. We had an amazing experience at Jungsik. Worth every penny!"
3416,"Jungsik was on my list for the longest time and I was so glad to be able to try it when I got back to the city last year.Favorites were the osetra caviar, octopus, kimbap, Galbi, and banana. The kimbap was a lot bigger than I expected but the textures and flavors were great. The galbi was perfectly cooked and so easy to cut and chew - literally melts in your mouth. The banana is one of my favorite desserts! I used to not be a big banana person, but it was amazing here. We opted for the signature menu without add ons, which seemed a bit small at first but we left satisfied and not uncomfortably full. Worked a few streets away from here which was super dangerous for my wallet but that goes to show how highly I thought of this place!"
3417,"By far my favorite restaurant in nyc as of date. I have been wanting to come here for a while now and I am so happy that I got to experience their signature tasting menu and wine pairing. My favorites were the Little Bites in the beginning, Ostera Caviar, Tuna Kimbap and Baby Banana. The Tuna Tartare was the best I've had and the Baby Banana was so soft and fun to eat. I love how they mixed traditional korean ingredients in very delicate and creative ways. Everything from the presentation to each and every flavor was impeccable. The service was excellent and definitely worthy of it's two Michelin Stars. Although the prices at Jungsik are pricey, it is arguably justified. You are not only paying for high quality, delicious food but also a unforgettable and unique dining experience. I would love to come back and dine here again."
3418,"What an incredibly memorable experience Jungsik was able to provide for me and my friend the other night. At first glance, the Signature menu doesn't seem like much but we were stuffed before the lamb even came out (last savory dish). We enjoyed every single dish of the night and the ode to the Korean heritage. The infamous banchan you see all over social media, which is only their amuse-bouche, was the star of the show. Each piece was so delicate and decadent; what a sublime way to start off the meal. The add-on hoedeopbap, uni bibimbap, is something you should definitely agree to when asked. The tuna kimbap is served like an edible cigar, served in the crispiest seaweed shell I have ever had, filled with tuna, Korean mustard, and truffle rice. To end the night, another social media famous dish - the banana. The creativity that went behind this is so impressive, a white chocolate shell shaped into a lifelike banana and even painted to look like it was ripe. Once you crack into it, you get a sweet serving of ice cream and banana mousse. Hats off to every person on the Jungsik team. Those two stars are well-deserved!"
3419,"tldr; food is a 4/5, service is a 3/5 - probably wouldn't recommend unless you have lots of cash to spare or are trying to collect the infinity stones of visiting all the Michelin starred spots in NYC!To get the bad quickly out of the way- We had a 5 or 530pm res for my bday and was very excited as i have heard good things from some of my friends. We were seated promptly, which was nice and food started coming quickly. Throughout, our server was extremely grumpy - bringing the entire mood of the meal down (if someone is standing 3 feet away glaring around, it is quite apparent). There was also a lot of whispering and confused looks throughout the meal, about what, I don't know.. Weird experience- would definitely not recommend for the service. At least they were pretty fast and explanations about food were fine.In terms of food, it's definitely not traditional Korean food. The most traditionally Korean food there was was the seaweed soup I got as an extra dish because it was my bday - amazing soup! Other dishes were really quite a spectrum. The octopus was the best I'd ever had - so soft, cut more easily than butter - and was paired with a light sauce with gochujang flavors. Yum! The amuse bouche at the beginning was an easy favourite for my group. Loved the innovative small bites, though the shrimp bite reminded me of shumai (dimsum shrimp dumplings?). Some of the other dishes confused me, including a ""kimbap"" which to me was a crispy seaweed avocado roll (isn't that.. Japanese?). None of the other dishes particularly stood out to me - they were pretty on par with expectations of ~fancy~ Korean food. Definitely a nice-to try spot, but not a please-visit-my-fave spot in NYC."
3420,"Incredible dining experience. From the minute we sat down, everything from the food to the service was impeccable. It is pricey ($298 including everything) but well worth the experience- emphasis on experience. The flavors are incredibly unique and unlike anything I've had before in traditional Asian cuisine or fine dining western cuisine. It's a rollercoaster of flavors and the servers' explanations of the chef's gastronomical decisions are incredibly interesting. Most of the dishes to tend to be on the richer side, so just prepared for heavier flavors of butter and truffle, but nicely balanced out by other flavors. Favorites included the appetizer banchan (side dishes), the scallops and sliced beets in brown butter sauce, and the mangosteen. Would highly recommend the wine pairing as well if you can swing it- they pair nicely with the dishes. Service was impeccable and felt like I was being pampered."
3421,Came here for a nice date night with my girlfriend. It's a difficult reservation to get so we were so appreciative to be able to lock one in last minute. Upon seating staff were attentive and thoroughly explained what we will be experiencing which made us super excited.Each dish came one by one as I savored each experience as a mini journey in my mouth. Ultimately it was about a 4 hour meal and we were ridiculously full and satisfied. The Uni dish was absurd. It's 10000000000% worth the add on. I'm not able to upload the videos but I did post on my IG tastywildflower if you want to check it out to drool. I can go on and on for each dish but the photos will just have to serve as my mouthpiece for now. My gf surprised me with a little congrats candle and dessert for my newly engagement which made the night more magical. I can't express enough how satisfying this experience was. I recommend everyone coming in for a night of being truly spoiled!
3422,"There are not enough positive things to say about this restaurant. The presentation, creativity, service, and quality of food make for an unforgettable experience. One point I would like to shine a light on that I do not see addressed in other reviews is the meticulous attention to detail. The banchan included a fried shrimp ball reminiscent of those found as dim sum. After the cute appetizers, the waiter came to use a crumb scraper tool to clean off the table. They use a trained technique to change the tablecloth, tuck in the edges, then iron it! The service is also seamless. They have waitstaff constantly rounding all tables and do not miss a beat in stopping to provide service to any table they can."
3423,"Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Did the signature tasting and though it was pricey, it was one of the best meals we have ever had. There wasn't a single course we didn't love. Definitely the best octopus we have ever had. Can't wait to try come back for the seasonal tasting! My only comment would be that the cocktails were crazy small - I was done in a few sips. Most of it was just ice. The wine was crazy expensive but looked like a good list if you are willing to pay for it."
3424,"I came here for my birthday dinner this past weekend, and it was the best choice truly I could have ever made. The restaurant inside is gorgeous; the decor is simple and beautiful and everything is clean. The service is also amazing, the servers were so attentive and extremely knowledgeable about everything and explained really well what each dish was. We did the seasonal menu, a prix fixe course of amuse bouche, squid, your choice of a rice dish (bossam, uni, or cod roe), black cod, squab, and a few small bites of dessert (sorbet with tea, corn ice cream over grilled corn and doenjang caramel with shaved cheese).  I also got served a little twist on miyeok-guk soup, the traditional soup we eat as a part of birthday celebrations. The Korean influences were definitely there, but with obvious influences of French cooking and modern American.  Every bite felt thoughtfully created, and we were actually surprisingly very full at the end despite how small everything looked. The dinner was just so much fun, and the quality of everything was just incredible. We all had different faves, it was so hard to pick one every course was just fun, interesting, and exciting. Worth every penny for sure.In addition to the meal, we also had a soju flight (they infuse their sojus in house) of cocoa, fruit, and ginseng. We also got signature cocktails, of which I had the Seoul mule (it was so sippable and refreshing, I absolutely loved it) and a pot of the white lotus tea which was delicate and a perfect way to end the meal after all of the wonderful and flavorful bites we had.We all had a really amazing time and I could not recommend this restaurant more."
3425,"Came here for an anniversary dinner and everything was delicious. Nothing was a miss, and the standouts for me were the caviar dish and the dessert course (apple). My husband had different ""favourite"" dishes which just goes to show that everything here is quite good and there's something for everyone."
3426,Wonderful experience every time. The food is amazing and the service is spot on. Thank you for providing such a good experience for us!
3427,"Came here for an anniversary dinner and my bf and I were so blown away. We got the signature menu with like ~8 courses (I forgot the number but they added an extra two courses lowkey? bc I didn't see some on the menu) and wow it's hands down one of the best (if not the best) fine dining I've ever had. Everything from the flavors to presentation were incredible and I loved how they put a unique twist on korean food. I can't even pick a favorite course because all of them were that delicious. Most times when restaurants alter traditional cuisines, it doesn't really work but I feel like this one def worked. The service was also top notch, as expected though. I'd definitely come here again some day in the future for a very special occasion!"
3428,"Food was good - though I would describe as modern American or French - with Korean influences / ingredients.  We had the seasonal menu, which was good and I would agree somewhere between 1-2 Michelin stars, but not many of the dishes were memorable in the way you might experience at a new resto angling for their first star.My favorite was actually a dessert off of the pricier signature menu on my friend's recommendation - a baby banana that was perfectly executed.  Like if I had a dream where banana peels were edible and I ate it - it would taste exactly like this.  It reminded me of desserts from some of the French Michelin 2-3 star places in the city - can only imagine there's some shared lineage there.Service was good though I couldn't understand the accents of multiple of the servers sometimes when they were explaining ingredients.Covid safe outdoor rooms complete with fans and windows was a nice touch."
3429,"Jungsik is a small restaurant close to the Financial District. It's difficult to get a reservation and the restaurant was totally full. We opted for the tasting menu with about 9 courses. This is a true Michelin 2 stars. The courses are just amazing, one after each other's. The caviar on O'toro was just astonishing and fresh. The first 5 little mise en bouche were also surprising and delicious. They have a nice selection of teas including decaf teas. They have an extra large list of great wines. The staff is excellent and exceeded expectations. Overall it's an excellent place and I will come back."
3430,"Definitely come here if you're looking for an amazingly cute and delicious meal. The food is elevated Korean and is completely worth the trip. I didn't expect to get full off the meal but it was quite filling towards the end. The starters on the tiers were my favorite, followed by the kimbap, and the banana dessert. I got the wine pairing and the selections went wonderfully well with generous pours. The wait staff are knowledgeable and kinda. The ambiance is calm and comfortable. I saw people dressed to the nines as well as some semi casual so it didn't feel incredibley stuffy. I would definitely go again."
3431,Solid food and amazing service. Had the cheaper option for the tasting menu and enjoyed most courses. The fried rice makes sure you're full by the end.
3432,"Terrible customer experience and terrible business practices. After paying almost $700 for a meal for two people, prepaid on Tock, while finishing the meal and preparing to leave, we were told that there were no additional charges since we didn't order any additional drinks or desserts, and that we were good to go. A day later, I see a charge for $20 on my credit card, and I email Jungsik to ask what this is, and they don't even bother replying to my email. They literally just sent a revised Tock email receipt with the $20 charge now on it, labeling it as ""water"". Several major issues here: (1) You can't just charge people after the fact, revise an already paid for receipt, and not notify customers of the charge? (2) Jungsik is seriously going to charge $20 for drinking water on top of an already fairly expensive meal in itself? Patrons seriously can't get complimentary water?? I've dined at Lazy Bear, Alinea, and French Laundry and have NEVER been charged for water. This ridiculous water issue aside, the meal was good, but nothing really stood out except for the banchan and scallop courses. Everything else was a bit lackluster. I would save your money for Lazy Bear and Alinea for an actually mindblowing meal with much better customer service and experience."
3433,"This was my daughter's wedding anniversary gift - she's now a physician and can afford it. LOL. Prepare to be Wowed. This classy, fabulously perfect restaurant is an experience one must have if you love to be entertained and get a belly full of the most innovative preparations I've had. Jungsik blows most restaurants away (including Le Bernardin - LOL take that again, Eric)Service is smooth and incredibly professional, the interior is a class unto itself and the staff is very pleasant. The dishes were crafted beautifully and gives you an explosion of taste that only the best ingredients prepared with skill and innovation. The entertainment value cannot be understated - it was almost painful to eat these pieces of art pretending to be food.I really can't fully describe the taste experience - you just have to go."
3434,"Jungsik was extremely pricey, but probably one of the best meals I've had. I'm generally averse to spending this much on a meal, but this was honestly probably worth it. There were so many courses I won't detail them here, but the overall vibe were small bites that had just an insane variety of flavors. This is fancy, fine dining at its peak. I find that often times I'm not a biggest fan of fine dining; I love stuffing my face with food, which usually goes great with having larger portions of one item. Often fine dining to me feels mediocre, with flavors occasionally whiffing and just an alright experience overall. However, this was definitely not the case. I'm looking at the items and honestly I don't think a single course missed. My least favorite were probably the scallops/beet or the crispy cooked fish, but they were still quite good. The other courses were honestly a bit mind blowing - the lamb was easily the best lamb I've ever had (so tender), the dessert of oat ice cream + something else kinda just blew my mind (and I don't even like dessert, but this was actually next level), the lobster + caviar was brilliant, and the banchan was just a bunch of unique flavors. The tuna kimbap was also really good. Damn.Without saying, the service was beyond anything we've had before and they tended to every need. I will say the only negative thing is I wish they gave us a menu so we could see/read what we were eating. They described each thing, but it's easy to forget the details and with the masks/louder dining room it was easy to miss things. We had asked but I think the waiter forgot, which was a slight bummer."
3435,What a experience. Everything is perfect. 3 hours dinner was fabulous. Absolutely delicious even though i was still a little bit hungry
3436,"Fortunate enough to try Jungsik in both Seoul and New York and I have to say it's hard to decide between the two. Although my party dined in the private room this time for New York, the format was identical to Seoul. Amazing service at both and felt every need was tended too.Notable things for me were the soft shell crab roll, pulpo, and lamb. Interesting mix of French and Korean flavors without relying too much on butter/richness. Also the staff was able to accommodate an off menu drink request that I noted prior to my reservation! Big points!Baby Banana was a game changer and I was in an instant state of euphoria upon first bite. You won't expect it texturally, but visuals of the Pineapple pen guy came to mind. That's how vivid the flavor was. I will be back!"
3437,"What an experience! I was blown away more and more with each entree that arrived to the table. Do not let the small portions fool you, the tasting menu was absolutely perfect, very well done! The vibe inside is casual yet sophisticated. This was my fist time enjoying Korean food, and I will definitely be back for more."
3438,"I had the five course seasonal menu just this past weekend. The courses were interesting, and the flavors were really easy to read - nothing was overpowering or covered up. The staff were super professional, but also welcoming. This sort of restaurant is a step out of my usual venture, but I never once felt uncomfortable or out of place. They added to the experience by explaining each course coherently and concisely. Would definitely recommend to those wanting to dip their foot into fine dining without feeling overwhelmed."
3439,"By far the fanciest and one of the most delicious meals I have had in my life! I would have my last meal at Jungsik if I was on death row! My husband and I celebrated our anniversary dinner and we had a wonderful time. We didn't want the night to end! We ordered their signature menu with 10 courses (including the Ban Chan- Korean side dishes and 2 pre-desserts). The entire meal did not disappoint! It just kept getting better as the night progressed. The dishes were tiny and delicate-looking but so complex in taste. Our favorite dishes were the octopus and the lamb. The octopus tasted like the fried chicken of the sea. It was so crunchy yet soft and slight chewy like mozzarella cheese . We were in love with the lamb and truffle, which was so buttery, tender, and juicy! The cute banana dessert was a nice end to our meal. The pastry chef must have put a lot of thought into it. It was white chocolate wrapped in banana mousse with ice cream on the side. It was very light and refreshing! Our meal at Jungsik was very memorable and we will reflect on it from years to come!"
3440,Took my fiancé here for his birthday in June and we had an amazing fine dining experience. Every dish was mind blowing good and the service was impeccable. My favorite was the appetizer side dishes they were so unique and look like artwork! We did the seasonal tasting menu and we felt satisfied at the end of the meal. Perfect place to celebrate any special occasion.
3441,"By far the best dining experience I've had in this city so far. I've been to several single Michelin star restaurants, and this is my first two star, and I see what all the hype is about.Went in for a girlfriend's birthday. Since it's still pandemic we decided to get outdoor seating, which was a included booth just outside the restaurant. The only caveat is that there was someone taking a smoke break a couple feet away, but we just closed the window and problem solved. The other caveat is the lighting if you want to take pictures since the booth lighting give a warm yellow hue to the images. We decided to get the 7-course signature tasting with wine pairing, and 3 other supplements - uni with seaweed rice, Ny-Seoul, and truffle cone. They ordered the supplements in a way that would best complement the tasting so the uni pared with the octopus, and truffle cone was served last. They also gave us champagne at the start as well as rice porridge for the birthday celebration. Each dish is amazing with each wine pairing, with the server explaining what to expect from the drink with each dish, whether it's going to be drier, sweeter, a bit alcoholic, or a bit acrid (which might be a put off to some, but this particular wine did actually pair well with the octopus). I would say the dishes themselves were more French-Korean fusion, than Korean-French fusion, but this is from someone who eats a lot of typical Korean food over time. They served a choice of tea and some petit four at the end, which to be honest, is a punch in the face of sweetness. A little too much for me. Overall, the food was amazing, wine was amazing, servers were attentive, received more food and drinks than expected. Spent a pretty penny, but would definitely come again for those special occasions (minus the wine pairing since it was in fact a lot of wine that was served). Also cooking a lot myself, there's some takeaways like the gochujang aioli, and the steamed egg in the banchan. H Mart also has the recipe for the braised octopus dish by Jungsik on their website, which is something I will need to try to make."
3442,"Worthy of its two Michelin stars, Jungsik was a wonderful experience. I'd say it was Korean ingredients and flavors executed with French techniques. Every component was delicious and well executed. There was nary a bite that I took that didn't taste as good as it looked.You can choose between their five or seven course tasting menu, and if you so desire, can add on an uni and a truffle course if you like. Their amuse bouches, which comes on top of the seven courses, were such an exciting introduction to the meal. It was a playful take on Korean banchan. Not very much of it was actually banchan-like in essence, other than the fact that it was a few small bites to begin the meal. There was steak tartare, foie gras, tuna, and cheese in those little bites - definitely not pickle or vegetable-forward.The courses were seafood-heavy, which I liked. The octopus was perfectly crisp and tender, the branzino was lightly smoked and had a crisp skin with flaky flesh. The meat dish, the galbi, was so perfect. I loved the little pickles along with the deeply marinated meat and sticky grains of rice. If you enjoy fish, I would really recommend springing for the seven course instead of the five course menu because whomever mans their fish station knows exactly what they're doing.Food aside, the space itself was pleasant. If you're expecting a more Korean experience, you'll be disappointed - you could be dining at Per Se or EMP with the simple and modern decor."
3443,"My bf brought me here as a surprise on my birthday. It was during the pandemic so we got our cute little private booth. All the staffs are extremely friendly and they made me feel so pampered lol. We got the 7 course signature  menu with wine pairing along with some supplements (no, I'm not talking about vitamins lol, that's what they call add-one) uni-seaweed rice, truffle cone and NY-Seoul dessert. The staff knew it was my birthday and they gave us an additional porridge dish on the house :). Every dish is outstanding and mind blowing.Every dish just bring a new wave of flavor and we just want time to stop to savor the taste. However, the most unexpectedly good and our favorite was the octopus, soooo tender and crispy. It is a Korean and french fusion restaurant but I definitely get more French vibe from the presentation and techniques with some Korean inspired flavors and ingredients. The banchan for example, usually side dishes served with the food to eat throughout the meal but here it is almost like an appetizer (still delicious though). They also definitely give a good amount of the wine when you get the wine pairing. Each course comes with a wine that compliments the dish and they are bang on with it. If you are light weight like me, you might either don't get the wine pairing/ don't finish the wine or give it to your friend because towards the end of the meal I was so tipsy I'm boarder line drunk and almost threw up this great meal hahah. They also gave us a printed copy of our order and the wine's name for each course incase we like that wine we will have a reference. The top also had ""Happy birthday Emily"" and gave us an envelope to store it. It's so cute. However, we left our cute memento in the restaurant's bathroom because ... we were that tipsy lol. Overall, it was a great experience: great service, great food and great ambiance. It is certainly expensive but we'll worth it!"
3444,"In 2020 my husband's birthday was marked by me working late, our restaurant delivery order getting lost, and finally Shake Shack coming through at 9pm. This year had to be different.My husband chose Jungsik for his 2021 birthday dinner and it was spectacular. He chose the signature menu, but the seasonal menu looked tempting too, particularly in the summer. I chose the wine pairing too, as food and wine pairing is one of the main reasons why I sincerely love wine.The decor and lighting were so chic and elegant, and the staff were all expertly trained. I was thrilled to be in the space.On to the food! The banchan were perfect - an umami-laden beef tartare bite on toasted brioche, a warmed eggy custard, a bouncy fish crudo, a crunchy mandoo, and a juicy nectarine wedge all tempted my palate.Next we started on our tasting menu, which had plenty of luxurious ingredients and artistic presentations. For me the standout courses were the octopus with spicy aioli, and the tuna kimbap with mild mustard. The only mild nit I could muster would the wine pairing with the galbi - I would have gone with a drier red (classic Bordeaux?) instead of a fruity Cab against the sweetness of the marinade. But this is splitting hairs, and every other wine pairing was utter perfection.Needless to say, my husband's 2021 birthday far outshined his sad 2020 pandemic birthday, and this was a fabulous meal."
3445,"So delicious. We did the signature tasting menu and... wow. So many memorable dishes. The octopus is the best I've had in my life, in every country and at every price point. How do you do that?! Also loved the egg soufflé in the beginning. I believe they added seaweed or something umami that instantly reminded me of the flavor and creaminess of good uni / sea urchin. Lots of other great courses as well. Banana Dessert was another highlight. So playful and fun, which was unexpected for the dining room ambiance but appreciated. I loved the tiny desserts, again, too cute!"
3446,"Second time here and it's better than we remembered it.  Totally worth the $70 car fare. Everyone was so warm and welcoming, nothing like when we first came here. Things like that make a difference to us. The room is beautiful and serene. We sat at the nice bar while waiting for our table. We had the signature menu.   Every course was delicious. The waitstaff was professional and friendly. We were asked which our favorite course was and we had to say we loved them all. We did remember the tuna kimbap and octopus course and they were both as good as we remembered them. The osetra caviar, scallop and snapper courses were fantastic. He had the galbi and I had the black cod. The galbi was delicious and soft as butter. The cod was light and moist. The baby banana was rich and decadent. We added on the NY Seoul and it was well worth the supplement. The champagne and wine were wonderful. We love the casual vibe, friendly service and memorable food."
3447,"A close friend chose Jungsik for a very early celebration dinner, and being a little extra, he ordered the 7 course tasting with all the supplements. When we arrived, the staff was still prepping for the first seating, and you could see that they were taking all necessary precautions for Covid safety. I found the staff to be extremely knowledgeable and engaging, and they gave the meal that extra little touch that elevates a meal into an experience. The meal started with five amuse bouches or ""banchan"": Jungsik's take on korean steamed egg, tuna tartare cone, wagyu bun, foie gras tart, and petit bouquet of salad. Initially, the stand out was the steamed egg, I definitely scraped the edges of the shell with my little spoon for the very last bits, superbly rich - but then we had the foie gras tart, enhanced with apple and hazelnut, this was possibly the best bite of the night, and I will be dreaming of this perfect bite for years. The next time I have some foie, I may slather it on apple slices. But all five were delicous.Osetra Caviar: beautifully paired with blue fin tuna and crunch for contrast, we did find the taste of the osetra caviar milder than previous experience had led us to expect, and to be fair, I was still reeling from the heady perfection of the foie gras tartFoie Gras Mandoo: be still my heart, two tiny bites of dumpling heaven are nestled underneath thin blankets of wagyu, warmed by the richest bone broth ""pho"" soup you'll ever encounter, if we weren't in a ""nice restaurant"" I might have licked the bowl clean.Octopus: You know how sometimes you have a ridiculously good dish that ruins your future enjoyment of every other subpar version? This Octopus did that for me, it was the most tender piece of octopus I've ever had the privilege of enjoying, coated with the most perfectly crisp coating, and paired with a gojuchang aioliBranzino: this was delicious, and paired with a sesame oil you poured around the dish yourself, but couldn't help to be overshadowed by some of the more unexpected highlights of the meal. Sorry branzino, you were great, but your friends are bombshellsTuna Kimbap: not only was this fun, this is nothing like the casual kimbap rolls I've picked up from a market or a tiny booth for a quick meal. Wrapped in the crispest crunchiest seaweed, I want endless supplies of this for picnicsUrchin: briney, creamy Maine uni topped on some of the best seaweed rice I've ever had, I may or may not have stolen more than my ""half"" of the dish. Royal Bibimbap: foie gras risotto topped in slices of truffles, delicious and extravagang, but we both agreed that the urchin easily outshined this dishGalbi: melt in your mouth tender wagyu, absolutely decadent. Please sir....I want some more Pear Persimmon Palate Cleanser: pear sorbet, persimmon, asian pear, and a cinnamon ginger punch (Su Jeong Gwa) to pour on top - It sounds a little silly, but this dish felt like a poem, a crisp ode to the transition from summer to autumn, both refreshing and a little spicy, personally it evoked the feeling of autumn leaves changing their colors, the sweetness of the pear and persimmon had a hint of wistfulness at the thought of the winter to come.Baby Banana: Jungsik's most well known dessert, was a whimsical way to kick off the full dessert courses, the white chocolate banana was a delight to break - and eat, accompanied with a delicious coffee ice cream and crunchy crumbleApple Tatin: endless layers of cramelized apple, cream, smoked tea caramel, maple feuilletage & coconut sorbet - this is apple pie a la mode' elevated to new heightsNew York Seoul: choux pastry, brown rice ice cream, caramel, pecan, corn sable, vanilla ice cream - this is a delight blending asian flavors into a medley of subtle then sweet, then salty, and back again.Petit Fours: After the desserts, 3 delightfully little petit fours were brought out, starting with a sesame yakgwa (a sweet little honey pastry in the shape of a flower), which led to a red date macaron, and ended with a tiny yuzu chocolate bonbon (it was so pretty, I didn't want to eat it), it was an exquisitely tart wake up to signal the end of a dreamlike symphony. Pastry Chef Eunji Lee is a master!Cocktails: we had every cocktail on the menu and the date soju, standouts were the refreshing Yujin (gin, yuzu, ginger thyme), and on the opposite end of the spectrum the super smoky Omijarita (mezcal, omija, cointreau, lime, plum salt) and the sweet date sojuJungsik is definitely worth the splurge to commemorate a special moment. DO.NOT.SKIP: foie gras mandoo, kimbap, octopus, galbi, urchin, and all the desserts - I still can't pick a favorite! Chef Yim Jung Sik's 2 Michelin stars are well deserved."
3448,"Went here about a week ago and this was honestly the best restaurant I've been to in NYC thus far (lived here for a quite a few years and avid foodie).  Each dish was super memorable, and incredibly tasty.  You can tell the chef's take on classic Korean dishes very well, and you will leave very satisfied.  Don't eat too much before going because even if it's a tasting menu, you will feel full at the end.  I personally liked the uni bibimbap (Jungsik's ever first dish) which was an add on, the lamb, and the kimbap.  The baby banana dessert was also so creative!  Be prepared to splurge a little when you're here.  Also the bathroom has a bidet which I've never seen at any Michelin Star restaurants yet.  I'd definitely go again!"
3449,Treated my relatives here. They came back elated with the experience and service.  I would say this is one of the best asian fusion dining experiences in nyc. They keep the overall korean traditional meal but add a good western twist in the flavors and ambience. Its not exactly korean but I love it. The one sad thing is there is no a la carte choices except for the banana and kimbap.  The banana btw... hard to describe ;) just get it
3450,"Very rarely do I write Yelp reviews. Very rarely but I had to this time. I visited the Ludlow location on a Sunday for lunch. The location wasn't as crowded as I thought. My dad and I waited 1hr and 6 mins for our food. Yes, I counted. We would've left out earlier but we already paid via the QR code system. It was the longest wait ever that we've had for food and just felt downright disrespectful for chicken and waffles. But that wasn't the main kicker, while eating I noticed that it was a roach on the wall that came out of the signage in the back of the restaurant. We took two-three bits and then left out in such disgust. I will never go back to Sweet Chick at any of the locations and I hope we receive that refund we were promised."
3451,"Me and my friends stopped at this place for brunch when visiting NYC, it is a chicken place so I went for their classic boneless fried chicken with waffles. It was delicious. My friends got a salad and the Benedict. They were also please. Only negative is that they don't have a espresso machine, however there is an excellent coffee shop next door."
3452,"If you grew up dining at Roscoe's chicken and waffles like me, you'll be disappointed at Sweet Chick. I guess I can't fault this place for not meeting the golden standard, but the chicken was pretty good while the waffles were average tasting. The food also took a good 45 minutes to come out, which was pretty annoying after waiting in line for close to an hour in the summer sun"
3453,"I love Sweet Chick! I'm an avid brunch-goer. Sweet Chick is one of the best places in NYC to go for a delicious brunch. The food is so tasty! The blueberry pancakes, two eggs scrambled with home fries, and the sweet chick waffle are all highly recommended.  Friendly service, no frills type of place. Just good food with a typical busy NYC vibe."
3454,"I've been to a few of the other locations, pre-covid and it gave a hipster meets down home feel. The food was okay, but nothing really drew me back to dine again. Friends from out of town want to go so, I went. This location on the other hand, was memorable for all the wrong reasons. Nasty bathrooms, sticky tables, an online ordering system with no options to pay with a major servicer (PayPal, applepay, venmo, etc), cash, or space for modifications. There are no servers, they are all runners.... unmasked, hanging out on the sidewalk chatting up their folks coming by. No thank you.My friend was hell bent on staying, so I ordered a $9 chicken biscuit without sauce. My friend got the Nashville hot chicken tenders and waffles and the chicken salad.Was it tasty? Yes? Was it worth it? Ehhhh. The ratio of chicken to biscuit was varied but still big enough to make it work.  I didn't have a server to even ask for a little ranch to put on my biscuit. Luckily, my friend shared some of hers from the little chicken salad she ordered (it's more of a basic side salad with avocado and chicken). We had to visit the bar to get a to go box and bag, again, no one check on your tables. I think I'll go elsewhere."
3455,I was working one night and was so hungry. I did my usual scroll through Ubereats to see what I could find and lo and behold I found this place still open for deliveries.  I've always wanted to try this place in person and it was always on my list to try but never found the time to go. I ended up ordering the chicken and waffles with no regrets.  The chicken was succulent however they missed my sauce that I ordered and I was disappointed about that. The waffles were so fluffy and soft. I liked their custom butter that they provided. I enjoyed my meal. It didn't seem like much but it definitely hit the spot and will try this spot again.
3456,"Randomly came across sweet chick a few weeks ago for lunch. The place has great fried chicken, something not all fried chicken places have. I ordered the regular chicken sandwich, mac and cheese, and the spicy chicken and waffles.  Chicken sandwich is really good but it's a pretty ordinary chicken sandwich. Max and cheese is great, super creamy. The real star of the show is the chicken and waffles. The spicy chicken comes with a nice vanilla sauce to balance it all out. Be careful though! Spicy means spicy!"
3457,Lemon poppyseed waffles were delicious!
3458,4 stars for the vegetarian chicken and waffles and hot Nashville vegetarian chicken sandwich. Subtracted a star for the crazy 1 hour wait for food on a not so busy morning. The vegetarian chicken was surprisingly delicious! Did not disappoint. I thought it was delicious in the hot Nashville chicken sandwich. Heat was subtle and such a nice after taste. The texture of the vegetarian patty/tenders was spot on and perfectly crisp. The waffle unfortunately was the less impressive part- a little burnt on the outside crust and mushy on the inside. Love a vegetarian option of this suuuper delicious treat!
3459,"Take-out takes 40 minutes here... only come here if you have time to waste. Might as well just dine-in so you can have a table to wait for your food. I got the Buffalo chicken sandwich and that shit is so soggy. Summary: Overhyped, food was slightly better than Popeyes, and they only can make 4 pieces of chicken an hour"
3460,"I love sweet chick so much!!!! I eat the vegetarian chicken and it's the best plant based chicken I have ever had. I wish they would open a restaurant on Long Island so I could have it more often. But anytime I'm in the city I make it a point to stop in and get something to eat now and something for later :) At this location there is no parking and very small, lines out the door so plan accordingly*"
3461,"Yummmmm. Chicken and waffles. Well made, juicy and not dry which is surprising since I got the boneless white meat version which is definitely prone to being overcooked! I got the Nashville chicken which was spicy but really not overly hot. Good amount of indoor and outdoor seating"
3462,"The chicken and waffles were delicious here! I came with 2 friends and the 3 of us ended up splitting 2 orders of chicken and waffles. That seemed to be the perfect portions for us 3! The classic chicken and waffles were perfect as they were. The apple cinnamon waffles were tasty as well, just not my favorite. They seemed a bit drier than the classic waffles. I also appreciated the contactless ordering system where you can also pay ahead before getting your food!"
3463,"The one star is for jenny. She accommodated me with a free drink after a poor experience- bad food overall and poor waiting experience. Not sure why this place is so popular. If you're looking for Nashville hot chicken do not go here, it's just spicy LIGHTLY breaded tenders of disappointment. When the waitress asked for my feedback she argued with my honest opinion; why even ask if my opinion upsets you? Strange experience overall, but shout outs for the free drinks."
3464,"I love sweet chic but the rats do too. I had to leave once I saw ratatouille up in there watching me eat  I let the staff know .. they looked , laughed and continued to go on with their evening lol smfh"
3465,"I was super excited to try Sweet Chick because I heard so many great things from my friends.However, the day that I came, my friend and I waited 56 minutes for our two waffles and hashbrowns order to come out...The kitchen was backed up that day apparently, but I think management could have taken more solutions-oriented measures or better proactive measures to manage expectations of customers. Many customers on this day were visibly upset and having to wait almost an hour for food is nearly unheard of in New York.The food was decent. Waffles could have been more crispy, but the chicken was seasoned pretty well.I am a little hesitant to come back due to my bad waiting experience, and the food was pretty decent. My friend and I came here after being told there was  a two hour wait over at Clinton St."
3466,"My food was so good that I forgot to take a photo.I ordered the vegetarian chicken and waffles and it was seitan done RIGHT.The vegetarian chicken was well seasoned, but not salty....it had a crunch, but wasn't dry. Hot sauce wasn't a necessity, but the ""chicken"" was still good with the hot sauce.The complementary waffle was fluffy. I couldn't taste any cinnamon or nutmeg, but I know there was vanilla added to the batter. It went very well with the butter (I think it was strawberry butter) and the syrup.I ate mine like I used to eat it at Roscoe's...take the chicken, fold it up in a piece of waffle, and dunk it in the syrup....Because everything was balanced when it came to the flavorings, everything went perfect with each other.Next time I come to NYC I will be back."
3467,"Seriously the best fried chicken I've ever had in New York or New Jersey! My search has finally ended! Juicy ,crispy and not too salty. hard to find!"
3468,"I really like Sweet Chick. This is probably the only place I ever order chicken and waffles. The only thing which I find weird and gave them a star less is you have to order and pay up front therefore if you want another drink, you probably won't want to get another because technically your tab is closed. Management, please consider that and you really don't need all those employees on the front doing absolutely nothing. I really like the bbq boneless chicken with the vanilla glazed waffles. I could never finish it so I enjoy taking a friend with me here. Last time I came, I wasn't offered utensils or water either. The hospitality can definitely use some improvement. Owners, take notes."
3469,"The breakfast burrito was junk, the place was virtually empty yet it took 30mins to prepare"
3470,"Came here on a Saturday night to catch up with a friend. No reservation was required and we were able to be seated immediately upon arrival. Huge seating area as you are escorted behind the front desk, including lower area seating which looked awesome.For starters, we shared the Anticuchos ($14), which are cow heart skewers, and Ceviche Mixto ($22). The Anticuchos was something unique I'd recommend trying. The Ceviche is pretty good as well, making up for the previous Ceviche experience I've had. We both also got a glass of Pisco Sour, which is a Peruvian cocktail; I also recommend trying at least once. You may end up getting more than one because it's sweet and can barely taste the liquor.For entree, I got the Matador Combo ($42). It probably would have been wise to have just ordered this alone to share between the two of us. This combo consisted of five different plated food: 1 whole Mama Juanita's rotisserie chicken, served with yellow rice, red beans, Tostones, Salchipapa, and Avocado Salad. I ended up taking the majority of my food home and it lasted me the next two days. The chicken as leftover still tasted phenomenal with the seasoning they put on."
3471,The place is loud but we were seated right away. Bathrooms are small and not the greatest. Portion sizes were huge! We shared the matador combo between 4 adults and 2 small kids and were all very full. The plantains were yummy and the chicken was seasoned well and moist. The real surprise was the fries with hotdogs! That was a great combination! The rice was solid. Green sauce is good (tastes like the salsa doña from taco deli). We tried the tres leches and was very disappointed. The flan was alright.
3472,"A M A Z I N G-- food, sangria, service-- but most of all it's the consistency. That's the real review. You can always count on a delicious leche de tigre!!"
3473,"This place is deceptively big! I would recommend making a reservation. The staff here performs on a professional level and our service was top notch. The martini was pretty good and the food was incredible. Really great authentic taste and a beautiful experience. Thank you, we will be back."
3474,"I liked the interior design and the margarita. The food was pretty average.On drinks, they have a full bar but no drink menu. They have sangria but not much wine (I think they just offer a ""red"" and a ""white""). They don't have grapefruit juice so sadly couldn't make a Paloma but the margarita was delicious!The green sauce they give you to start is like crack - super addicting. I asked to take some home with our leftovers. The juanita's chicken wasn't bad (we started with a quarter) and same for the lomo saltado (though it's crazy heavy on the onions so beware - you will have bad breath for days). Definitely wasn't a fan of the corvino a la macho - the seafood didn't taste fresh and the sauce was so heavy and creamy that it overpowered the seafood. They do seem like they are good for larger groups - very spacious inside and generally a fun atmosphere."
3475,"Great Peruvian spot! Came here with 2 other friends on a Sunday evening for dinner and was seated right away. We got the Limeño Cebiche to share which was great. I just wish that it came with some chips or something to eat with. For my meal I got the Lomo Saltado, which was great. The filet mignon was so juicy and delicious. Great meal!"
3476,"Let's start with the fact that when you walk in you have no idea how big the restaurant is... so big and beautiful, love the decor. The portions are large so make sure you are ready to eat!! Soooo good... if you like Peruvian I would say it's a must try!"
3477,The arroz chaufa was fantastic. I could eat it non stop. The anticuchos were delicious. Beef heart. It was so soft and cooked just right. The fried calamari was okay. The rotisserie chicken was good. Wish I had more of that. Overall not bad. The tree leches that I got was super super sweet so watch out for that
3478,Omg I loved it here! Stopped by while waiting for a taping of @CthaShow and was so glad they had a lunch special. The food was great and the ambiance was even better!!!!! I will definitely be coming back for sure. Maybe date night or girls night or both! But next time I need pictures for sure. Cuz again DECOR!
3479,"I've been coming here since 2010 when I worked at nearby med center. Disappointing but not surprisingly, this place shows the aftermath of the pandemic. I used to come here after a long day and enjoy the El Matador Combo, ceviche, sangria and take the leftovers home. Every morsel of juicy chicken drenched in the spicy green sauce made up for 12 hours in the microscope room. Most recently I visited this spot after one year and the food is just not the same anymore. Firstly the red sangria which used to come with fruit didn't and tasted diluted. The ceviche mixto flavor was good but there was half as many seafood items than before. The chicken however was still just as juicy and hot. Very ~MOIST~. The spicy green sauce which I like to refer to as Magic Sauce was still just as good as I remembered. The salchipapas were tasty as well! I hope to keep coming back here as much as I can when I'm in town. I really hope this location survives! I know this isn't the only place that is suffering in NY."
3480,"Food was pretty good, even though I was underwhelmed by the chicken, the green sauce saved it. The menu is joy big but pretty much everything is tasty. They serve fast. The atmosphere is really nice as well. I wouldn't mind coming back"
3481,"Excellent Peruvian food! They also provide right-sized portions meaning they provide you with the portions you would expect if you are sitting in your (or an) authentic Latin, African, or Caribbean mother's kitchen. I only rated four stars because the aji sauce was not that great and I love aji sauceP.s., my review is based on my order of the Parihuela soup."
3482,"It took me a while to write this review because I was and still am so disgusted by my experience here. I came for a work dinner with colleagues. We arrived at 5pm because I had a 7pm meeting. 2 hours to have dinner? Plenty of time. We ordered an appetizer and three dishes. my friend and I got the same dish and the third member of our party got something else. We ate our appetizer which came out promptly. Then we are sitting. Sitting. Suddenly the place is full. Then the table next to us finishes their meal. We are waiting over an hour for three dishes. We call over our waiter who tells us it will be out soon. This is where it becomes a shit show. First the person with the different order got his first. I had to wait for myself and my friend to get his order. Then one order came out. The meat was cold, it was overcooked. We call the waiter over he doesn't even apologize he takes it like he is annoyed back to the kitchen. It comes out again (again only 2 people technically even got their meal) they just put it in the microwave. We again said this is unacceptable to take it back it is overcooked. Annoyed again the waiter leaves (mind you no apology, nothing but attitude). Finally he brings out a new one properly cooked for my friend and I am sitting there with no food. I tell him look it is already 6:45 i have a meeting please just wrap mine to go. He comes out with a bag, but I have a bad feeling. I open it, and guess what? He gave me the shitty order that was overcooked. I complained and he leaves. He comes back with another order but at this point I have no time. I take it home. I am eating my dinner during my meeting and find GROSS PAPER in my food! DISGUSTING. No one and I mean no one ever apologizes or comps us for any of it. I WOULD NEVER SET FOOT IN THIS PLACE AGAIN."
3483,"This was FANTASTIC! We stopped in before a show at The Green Room 42 in Yotel for dinner.  The interior looks great and we were promptly seated.  We ordered a pitcher of sangria, ensalada de avocado, anticuchos, 2 whole chickens, arrroz chaufa with chicken and shrimp, the tacu tacu (lomo saltado with Peruvian refried rice and beans & fried egg, the maduros and salchipapapa. The salsa verde at the table is excellent! All delicious!  For dessert, coffee, tres leches cake and the lucuma ice cream.  The service, the ambiance and the food were spectacular.  You must be vaccinated and have proof to enter."
3484,Peruvian food here is delicious. The lower level dining area creates a unique ambience - it feels secretive and intimate yet the conversations were flowing well. Pio Pio does it right and I've definitely recommended this spot to others.
3485,"Such a simple rotisserie chicken, but so juicy and flavorful  Peruvians know what's up. I first came here 5 years ago and ordered their paella which I swore I would go back for. Before coming back, I checked their Yelp and kept seeing pictures of sliced up rotisserie chicken on a plate, no fancy plating or anything. So I was like wtf is up with that?? I tried it and now I know why everyone keeps posting it. The meat just comes apart and is so well seasoned. The flavor doesn't just stop near the skin, but goes all the way to every part of the chicken. This, plus their saffron rice and beans makes for a simple, but delicious dinner. Their lomo saltado was also very well made. I usually don't enjoy steak anymore just because everything else seems so tough and chewy compared to wagyu, but this one I actually enjoyed. The steak was tender and I was able to actually just use my spoon to cut it. And just like the chicken, it was perfectly seasoned. Nothing too flavorful, but just a light taste that paired well with the sauce. The paella (arroz con mariscos) was also good, but I couldn't really taste the saffron in it. It was also a bit too loaded with seafood which may or may not be a good thing depending on your preferences, but I do enjoy a 1:2 ratio of meat to rice."
3486,"Pio Pio is a great spot for Peruvian food and rotisserie chicken in Hell's Kitchen. I haven't been since before COVID hit, and I miss their delicious chicken, sides, and appetizers. Unlike some of the other Pio Pio locations, this one was good for groups back when we could dine in, since the dining room was huge. From the outside, it looked small, but it was amazing how much space they had, especially for this area.Our favorite thing there was the Matador combo, which came with a whole chicken, rice, beans, tostones, salchipapas, and avocado salad for around $40. It was a complete meal with large portions (so there were often leftovers) for a great price, and the dishes were consistently good. Don't forget to add some of the green sauce to everything!"
3487,"Came here on a Sunday evening with no reservations and were seated very quickly as they have a large underground sitting area, as well as the ground level seating. We ordered pisco sours for our drinks which were medium strong and well made. I got the tacu tacu, which was great; the meat was very soft and tender and the rice and beans were an amazing complement. The Juanita's rotisserie chicken, which can be ordered with just the dark meat, was also excellent. Finally the mixto ceviche was lovely, acidic and with a large portion. We ordered it spicy, but honestly it was still pretty mild. For sides we ordered maduros and rice and beans which were also great. Overall would highly recommend. Only caveats are that, since the seating area is quite large, the service is on the slow side and the atmosphere is quite loud. But still worth the food!"
3488,"This place doesn't need yet another fantastic review, but alas, here it is. This is amazing Peruvian food. We enjoyed each course and the pisco sour was delicious as well. I'm a bit of a flan snob and this one is right on the money. We also had the Camarones Cuzco, and Empanadas de Pollo as well. Great romantic atmosphere, good for dates or groups. Just awesome!"
3489,Delicious food and drinks !! And amazing and friendly service .  These two pretty consistent every time I've been there about 3 times
3490,"I had a nice experience here the first time. The setting inside is very spacious with an upper deck and a large hall-style dining tables in the lower floor. Even though the food was overpriced for the quality, I was happy to see comfort food and drinks I enjoyed in Peru like lomo saltado, cusquena beer and inca cola.Visiting the second time yesterday, however, I was disappointed to see the C health rating that cites: inappropriate ""pesticide use,"" ""prohibited chemical used,"" ""evidence of mice,"" and ""filth flies."" This was very sad to see and I'm not sure I would have the courage to return."
3491,"The manager, Christian, should get fired. He is definitely not manager quality. I just read a previous review about a bad manager, and it sounded like him too. He was extremely rude and has no concept of customer service. I took my employees out for a company dinner. One of them found a glass particle in his mouth while he was chewing on his food. So I called our server and nicely explained. He took that small glass particle to show it to the manager and informed me that his manager will come out to talk to us. The manager, Christian, didn't show up for 30 minutes until I asked my server about him on the way to the bathroom. The server went to check again. The manager bumped into me as I was coming out from the bathroom, so I asked why he didn't come out to our table earlier. I told him what got me upset wasn't the fact that there was a glass particle in the food, but it was the fact that he didn't care. His attitude was like... Why are you upset? I added, if a glass particle came out from a customer's mouth, it is a problem and he should come out quickly to check on them. Instead of apologizing, he was trying to lecture me in the most rude and arrogant tone of voice saying ""I went to the table, and you were the one who wasn't there"". He literally came to our table because I asked the server to bring him. His attitude was unbelievably rude. The summary of his story was that: he was busy / who knows if it was a glass particle or a glitter and where that came out from / if no one got hurt, what's the big deal, what do you want me to do? I was so upset and about to lose my temper but I didn't want to create a scene or ruin my company dinner. I wrapped up the conversation by telling him to go apologize to my employee who found the glass particle in his mouth. So the manager came over to the table and had a conversation with my employee. I wasn't looking. Later on I was told that he basically said I was a b**** And the reason why he was at the table to apologize is because I told him to do so. He wasn't genuinely sorry for what happened with the glass particle or making us wait. It's a shame that Pio Pio 8 has such an unprofessional manager. All other staffs were nice except him. Especially, our server, Juan, who was super sweet and nice. He expressed how he felt bad for what happened. When I asked him for the manager's name, he wasn't able to tell me. He seemed so tensed up and scared that he would get in trouble. So I had to find a different way to find the manager's name. It could've been a better experience if the manager, Christian, wasn't there. I really hope they can fire him or train him to become a decent person. He was the worst manager with the worst costumer service.One star because at least the food and other staffs were nice."
3492,"I've been going here for many many years and love how they have so many different locations. However, this is my favorite one especially to take bigger groups. Their portions are huge and drinks are great. I tried their tres leche for the first time (I usually always get the flan) and oh my god, it was amazing!!!"
3493,"The health score sign read C in the window which was a bit disturbing but the food was VERY VERY TASTY. Hoping i don't get sick but right now I am TEAM PIO PIO 8!!!! The chicken and the beans and rice, garlic and avocado sauce, maduros was amazing. The yuca frita, under cooked and horrible. The sangria was pretty good too."
3494,"This is the best rotisserie chicken dinner I've ever had. If you come here with a group of friends, the Matador Combo should be a mandatory order. It can easily feed 3-4 people and only cost $42, which is probably the best food deal you can find in Hell's Kitchen. The combo has an onslaught of plates that consisted of:- A whole Mama Juanita's Chicken: Well-seasoned and fall-off-the-bone tender.- Yellow rice and beans- Tostones (twice-fried plantain slices)- Avocado salad- Salchipapa (French fries and hot dog slices)I came here with two other friends, and though we tried our hardest, we had to take home leftover plantains and French fries. The next day I skipped breakfast and lunch because I was so stuffed from dinner at Pio Pio.(Personal accomplishment: 200th review!)"
3495,"I paid $28 for this food , it was only vegetables with 2 pieces steak and was very salty ! The only good thing about this restaurant was service !"
3496,Pio Pio has fantastic and attentive staff. They walked around continuously checking up to make sure you have everything you need. The food was super tasty! We did a variety of different plates to try. Drinks were strong but for the price it was worth it. Overall had a fantastic experience here and will likely come again when staying in NYC!
3497,"T.H. and I recently moved into the area and we are glad to be close by to a Pio Pio! Often times we wander in on a weeknight, are seated immediately, and almost immediately get to chow down. The dining experience is best as a communal one so bring only people you are comfortable sharing dishes with!T.H. and I typically get a half chicken, an avocado salad, and one more dish. The chicken always comes out juicy and delicious. The skin is amazingly flavorful with the right amount of salt, spices, and a slightly smokey bbq flavor. Paired with the green sauce, this chicken is a slice of heaven on the taste buds. The avocado salad is simple but well done. The vinaigrette is light but pairs with the creamy avocado perfectly. It's always a nice bit of veg to pair with our protein heavy dinner.For the third dish we have done several at this point. My favorite is the steamed potato with their house sauce on top (I am a die hard potato monster). T.H. prefers the steak atop French fries which allows the meat juices to soak and make a bed of delicious goodness.So why 5 stars? I love the food and it's a great staple for the area. I haven't had a bad experience in coming 5+ times and the service is always pleasant. The restaurant is large and also has outdoor seating for those who prefer."
3498,Delicious lunch fast friendly service. Consistency throughout all locations! Also great for late night munchies
3499,"We went to this restaurant because it was recommended by my daughter in lawWent here for my daughters birthdayWe ordered a family meal which my son picked, Wao just delicious, we've eaten in Peruvian restaurants but this one just set the scale highWe had the 4 ceviches as an appetizer Jalea& chaufa chicken rice & share the red sangriaThe tartar ceviche was my favorite second leche de Tigre Jalea was made fresh not from the mix package that you get from other placesI will definitely come back to try other dishes"
3500,"The food is very big portioned, delicious, and well worth it. Also when you first walk into the restaurant, it opens up into this huge room that's really nice. Everyone enjoyed all their food choices and the cocktails. Highly recommend."
3501,"Good place, good food, good peruvian! Very delicious food, interesting plate, but its missing aji de galina......"
3502,"Pio Pio is my go to Peruvian restaurant. Ordered deliveries from here like 3x the past few months lol. Came here for a dinner during a thunderstorm with my boyfriend and his family, place was not packed. Our go to order is always the Juanita's chicken with a side of maduras. This time, my boyfriend and I decided to order the aji de gallina since we had a good experience with this dish in a different restaurant. I was still hesitant to order a different one since trying out new food always disappoints me but boy was it the best decision ever! We both ordered it. Portion was huge! We were able to save some for dinner the next day. It's absolutely delicious! We also ordered their pisco sour which tasted amazing as well! We all had a second round lol. Aji de gallina is now a go to order for me."
3503,"Overall food was great the cevishe . Potatoes with there special yellow sauce  , cows heart yummy, chicken,rice and beans  . The restaurant wasn't crowded confortable. No crowd , yesss"
3504,"Ordered the matador combo, nikkei , and the arroz con mariscos. So! Much! Food! Don't underestimate the sangria, it will put you on your bum after a few glasses but it was delish as well. The food was all really good, but the arroz con mariscos was definitely my favorite and I highly recommend trying it if you like seafood! 10/10"
3505,"We ordered chicken empanadas and the Matador Combo. We were two adults and there was enough food for 4! The chicken, rice, beans, and grilled hot dogs with French fries were flavorful and memorable. The salad had a litendressing and a lot d avocado. The outside seating was very pleasant. The Merlot was light with a complex ending and an excellent value!"
3506,The service was ok. The staff was friendly but it took them a long time to come to my table and Didn't follow up if everything was OK. My partner said the food was great. I found it a little salty.  Lunch special is a great deal you get a big plate full of food.
3507,It was a hole in the wall from the outside. But really nice ambiance when you get inside. The food and drinks were amazing. My husband and I tried a little bit of everything and nothing disappointed. Everything was on point. The food came out so fast and service was excellent. Will definitely be going back for more!
3508,Not impress with the food at all fried chicken with mixed rice didn't go well together and stuffed avocado taste funny. I think they change the chef the new chef not good the old one is better
3509,"You cannot go wrong with Pio Pio chicken. It is the most tender, flavorful chicken you will ever have. Try either the Peruvian Combo or the Matador Combo to share for two people (only difference is that the former comes with just fries while the latter comes with rice, beans, fries/sausages, and what looked like fried plantains). Have gone many times pre-COVID and have ordered to-go during COVID...it is consistently delicious!!!"
3510,"Not authentic, but still very tasty.  Portions are huge!  The acoustic of the place makes it LOUD."
3511,"Authentic Peruvian food and great indoor decor. My friends and I shared the whole chicken, paella, friend plantains and seafood. Portions were very large and delicious!"
3512,Server was really nice and the food was delicious. Huge portions I took half to go. Kind of upset they only had whole chicken for sale as I wanted some but was by myself but the lomo saltado did not disappoint and the drink was delicious
3513,"Saddened to be having to leave this review, as a Peruvian myself. However, my party and I were extremely disappointed and dissatisfied by the service. First of all, there was a little piece of plastic in my drink. Servers are very inattentive and had us waiting 30 minutes just to order. Super slow and it wasn't even very busy. I could say about 5 more incidences, but I'm not going to waste my time. Only putting two stars because obviously, Peruvian food is great. New York needs an actual good Peruvian restaurant."
3514,"INCREDIBLE. We had an amazing meal at Pio Pio. No reservations; first come first serve. We had about 10 minute wait, and we sat downstairs where it was popping. We got the calamari frita and chicken empanadas for appetizers. They were both pipping hot, and both so filling. The empanada dough is incredible you can definitely tell it's made fresh. For the main meal we had juanitas chicken with rice and bean, tostones, pollo saltado, and arroz chaufa with chicken, steak, and shrimp. Everything was incredible. It came out super quickly and the portions are huge. We had leftovers of everything."
3515,Family night everything was amazing we had several apps as in papa la guacaina we had 2 types of ceviches and the chicken empanadas deliciousssssss then we got 2 matador combos and the lomo saltado again amazingggggg only thing where it was off was the dessert the 3 leches was literally frozen smh and they have to update the bathroom so tiny literally 2 for each gender other than that azmazing
3516,"I haven't been to a Pio Pio since the one in Astoria closed down. But I was hyped to hear that my holiday party was going to be here! I'm always in the mood for succulent rotisserie chicken! This location was a pain to find. I must have walked past it like 3 times. It's very subtle, and it's even worse if you're trying to find it after the sun goes down. You'll have to look for the building number if you want a chance in hell of not walking back and forth like an idiot! Pio Pio 8 has two floors. The top floor has a bar and a few tables for groups on the smaller side. The downstairs section is clearly for larger tables or corporate functions. Entering the lower level makes you feel like you just got into the VIP section of the club. We took our seats and were immediately brought pitchers of sangria. For the amount of people stuffed into this floor, I was very impressed by the quality of service. We got some fried calamari to start off with which was delicious. It came with a side of the special Peruvian green sauce. It was an amazing compliment to it. Soon after came the moment we were waiting for: the pollo! It was just as good as I remembered. The skin was glistening with seasoning and the chicken was juicy and tender. After awhile I stopped pretending like I had table manners and just ripped into the chicken with my hands. It was a very satisfying moment. I would love to return to the top floor for a more low-key experience next time!"
3517,This place is huge!!! Definitely have room for a big party. Overall thought the food was solid. A bit pricey but the portion sizes are pretty big. My one complaint was that I found the entrees a tad salty.
3518,"Really liked the vibe of this place. There's outdoor seating, first floor, and a bottom floor which makes you feel like you're entering an even more exclusive part of the restaurant honestly. This place was highly recommended from friends from the family style portions and my my were the recommenders right! We ordered chicken empanadas, fried calamari, seafood fettuccini the Matador combo and the Peruvian Combo which both came with TONS of food: including rice and beans, yucca fries, sweet plantains, hot dogs and fries, and avocado salad. I loved that we were able to do substitutions also, giving us a wider var The service was a bit delayed which I didn't like. I ordered a cranberry juice and it literally took m 30 minutes for them to bring it. By this time, I was basically finished eating. When we asked the server about it he yelled and said, ""BUT YOU HAVE WATER AND YOU'RE EATING"". Excuse me sir? That logic makes no sense. This was a huge turn off, especially when he came back and  tried to make a joke about his error AND STILL CHARGED US FOR THE DRINK. I know it's something small like a cranberry juice but the way he handled it was extremely poor. I would definitely be interested in trying the other locations because their food was delicious. Hopefully the servers at different spots won't be as rude!"
3519,"I'm very familiar with Pio Pio & in fact have never been disappointed with the location in Queens. I ordered from here via UberEats & everything tasted exactly as it does from the Queens location. I did ask for a side of avocado & normally it's placed in the tin container & it's probably a whole avocado, but this location had it in a plastic & it looked like half of a avocado (I'm serious about my avocado 8-) I ordered 2 sodas too, which they forgot to give that to me too, but the food was good."
3520,"For the price, the food is just not up to snuff. I ordered the whole rotisserie chicken, and it was just not flavorful enough. The saffron rice wasn't great either. If you're looking for great Peruvian, this isn't it. If you want tasty Peruvian, check out Flor de Mayo on the Upper West Side. The Lomo Platter is legit!!"
3521,"wow! so happy to stumble upon this place after riding bikes uptown! I was starving so didn't get any food pics but omg was the chicken and green sauce amazing! Perfectly seasoned chicken (which I find is hard to do for may places!!) and then add a slightly herbal tangy green sauce and mildly spicy skin....heaven! We also got the fried calamari that was solid but I think I'll skip next time in favor of a ceviche (I saw a few come out to other tables and they look awesome!) Btw....$10 for a half chicken is prob the steak of the entire neighborhood. We had margaritas, pisco sours and a modelo negra. I think the modelo negra was divine with the chicken, the perfect thing to cool it down a little and add some sweetness. I also recommend the pisco sours so frothy and smooth and I always love the bitters on the top. Service was very quick and attentive. It started raining on us and they ran the check over right away. Can't wait to come back!!"
3522,The food was wonderful and the service was great! The ambience was great! I really liked the decor...The food was full of flavor...I am use to eating Peruvian food so I must say they did a great job with the food!
3523,Best Peruvian food I've tried! I ordered for delivery. But the presentation was still good considering... and the taste even better! Highly recommend! Excellent flavor!
3524,"I did not get a chance to sit down and eat at this place. Given the hype about this I really wanted to check it out. I called ahead to see if I can reserve a table for 7 but they said they don't accept reservations and it's a walk in. So I'm like ok cool, I'll be there in 20. Once I get there there's a huge line and when I walk in to get a table, the person at the front desk tells me I should have reserved a table since there's a long wait. The lack of consistency is what killed me so if you're reading this pio pio please improve on that. Hopefully I can try this place out in the near future."
3525,"Beware! No COVID and health and safety precautions being followed at this restaurant. I've been coming to pio pio for years pre pandemic and now after. I went on 7/16/21, sat indoors since it is now back open. I was baffled when I saw waiters taking orders without a mask on, also served your food and made your drinks without masks. At one point a waiter even came to my face and asked if I needed anything else  while my own mask was off as I was eating. I was honestly VERY uncomfortable. Although their food is good, as it has been for years, It completely affected my experience knowing that their employees take no precautions to keep their guests safe while the COVID delta strain is still running rampant. I don't recommend them because of this. It's not worth it to me. They just went from a loyal customer to a very unhapppy customer. Please do better to make your guests feel safe."
3526,This my 2nd time ordering from Pio and it's the same disappointment. Chicken appears to have roasted the night before and is dry. Cannot have for lunch tomorrow
3527,"Delicious food and drinks. We had Juanita's chicken, the fried rice, and lomo saltado. Great friendly service and the green sauce is *chef's kiss*"
3528,"We had the sea bass with peruvian green rice which was DELICIOUS!!! The green sauce is spicey and so good. I put it on everything! Sangria, empanadas, and maduros were good as well. My aunt and uncle said the rotisserie chicken was the best they ever had. This was my third time eatting at this location and each time was just as good or better than the first time. Good size portions...you definitely won't leave hungry! I will be returning whenever I'm in NYC."
3529,"We made reservations for seven and arrived a bit early, luckily we were seated immediately! We were escorted past the bar and downstairs, we felt the cool air which was a reprieve from the NYC heat. The ambiance was amazing, the wood stick walls and cool concrete give this restaurant a high end and super trendy look! We ordered drinks and the server was patient and took our order. We ordered the sampler plate to give everything a try for starters. We each ordered different plates and enjoyed every single one of them! The food was sooo tasty! Really good authentic Peruvian food! Thanks for the experience!"
3530,"If you're looking for a huge, fluffy delicious and fresh donut, DOUGH should be your first stop. This is one of the top donut's I've ever had. I had ordered a Cheesecake donut and she DID NOT DISAPPOINT. It had all the subtle hints reminiscent of a cheesecake but with all of the goodness from a donut. These are huge, so I recommend coming here to split one if you don't want to eat it as a whole meal. The service was great, the interior is nice in that it has a nice long table for dining. (Keep in mind I believe this is a laptop-free establishment!) Overall, a stunning performance. I don't currently see any need for improvement. 5/5"
3531,"This business and concept is just out of control !!!, downright delicious , satisfying, and leaves you incomprehensibly happy !!! The first of it's kind was actually the Doughnut Plant , however, Dough, has proven to be fresher & better. The selection of doughnuts is unmatched with flavors of all kinds.. along with a vegan selection as well!!! I tried the coconut and vegan blood orange. Wowie!!! Soo great and so yummy - perfect for that cheat meal! I have to say, the coconut doughnut was my favorite. The cream on the inside was to die for! Let's just say, you'll be happy to try Dough if you're around the area! Enjoy :))) I know I did!"
3532,In terms of size and quality this is close to the best donuts you can probably get. I actually came since I saw on tik tok that they had Chinese new year donuts but the regular ones looked great too! It's of course going to be on the pricier side but it's definitely worth it! I'd split the donut amongst people just because it's relatively filling!
3533,Dough is one of those places that just works. The product stays true to the name since the donuts are very doughy. The toppings were good and unique but there isn't enough frosting typically.  The proportions of donut to topping is off. The peanut butter donut looked ridiculous. They have a lot of different toppings and I may try them all.  These are meals in itself but also the price matches that. This isn't a cheap donut but it is hefty. Just wish it wasn't as doughy!
3534,"I've been going dough doughnuts for years, it's one of my favorite places in Manhattan for donuts. The donuts are large and fluffy with good flavors. They always have a set of standard flavors and several daily ones, there are usually a few vegan options as well. Try the hibiscus donut if you want something a bit out of the ordinary, it'd a standard flavor always available. The only thing that really bothers me is that there is no just cup of water, you have to buy the bottled water which is shady in my opinion."
3535,"There was something so weirdly, amazingly delicious about the passion fruit glaze on yeasty dough that I had to stop walking, stand on the sidewalk and laugh in surprise at the doughnut in my hand. I might have found the whole thing slightly too sweet, and I am not entirely convinced that the cacao nibs added anything, but I definitely respect their flavors."
3536,"Definitely get 6 donuts if you come to Dough, you must try a bite of each! The flavors here are too good to pass up. Personal favorites are the coconut crème and the hibiscus - both are unique and the donuts are light and airy but also decadent in each bite. Service here is always nice too! Even during the holidays when the wait can be long!"
3537,"I wanted to give them 4 stars but we tried a variety of donuts and I only liked the hibiscus one because it's unique. The rest were more dough than flavor. I guess that's why the placed is named dough. I don't mind the calories if it's all full of flavor. But the flavor is mainly on the outside and the rest is dough. A lot of people like this place and recommend it so maybe people like that, but it's not for me."
3538,"Dough is highly related on Yelp and am glad that I did not actually wait in line to try them. I was very fortunate to have friends bring my husband and I a box from here to share with us to try. The flavors that we had in our box included:Toasted coconut, $4.95 prior to tax- I had a few bites of this and thought it was pretty good. The donut was pretty flavorful and had a good bite. If you like coconut, you will like this. Mocha Almond Crunch, $5.45 prior to tax- I didn't get to try this but my husband did. He thought the flavor was just okay but the donut itself was good. Plain Glaze, $4.95 prior to tax- I had a bite of this and this was pretty good. Definitely a tasty classic. Vegan Plain Glaze, $4.95 prior to tax- My husband had this and thought it tasted nearly the same as the plain glaze. He liked it. Cinnamon Sugar, $4.95 prior to tax- My husband and I didn't try this one. Dulce de Leche w/ Toasted Almonds, $5.45 prior to tax- Of the ones I tried, this one was my favorite. I liked the toasted slivered almonds in each bite. But this donut is sweet. -------------------------- (Total= $33.42 after tax)These donuts are pretty big and dense, which I guess is why they charge so much for one. You can get pretty full off of one, which is why I had a few bites of the donuts I tried so I can try more than one. The toasted coconut was not consumed on the day of purchase and half of the Mocha Almond Crunch, but the next day. The toasted coconut was not stale and according to my husband, the mocha almond crunch wasn't either. I think I would want to visit this location in person (hoping there is no line to wait in though) and try their other flavors like the hibiscus and the nutella filled donut."
3539,"Dear Dough,Yes, your donuts look tempting. No, they're not bland and dry. And yes, they cost more than a donut from Dunkin. But you can't put a price on the best donuts in New York City.Nelson M. might disagree with me, but as far I know Nelson M. is a Dunkin Donuts regional manager who went undercover to leave you a poor review. How else could someone possibly take a bite out of your donuts and not think it's the best piece of gluten they've ever chewed on?Your cinnamon sugar donuts haunt my dreams in the best possible way. I promise you I will forever be a customer of yours. Even if my biggest fear of developing a gluten allergy comes to life.I'll never give up on your dough, Dough.All the best in the name of food.- Yelpman"
3540,"If I could give 6 stars I would!!! I have never had lighter, softer donut in my life.It has that light pillowy texture on the inside. The portion is huge. The cinnamon sugar vegan is also available. Can't wait to try other flavors"
3541,"Oh My God!!! These donuts are to die for. Every flavor we got was soooo good. Not too sweet (which is great) and it's addicting. And the donuts are so fluffy and soft.And if anyone is craving malasadas, try their donuts. It's definitely a delightful treat!"
3542,"Airy pillowy doughy goodness! These doughnuts are $4.50 each but totally worth it for their uniqueness and how big they are! Got the Nutella filled and Boston Cream one. The Nutella filled was so amazing, dusted with a cinnamon sugar on the outside with just the perfect amount of Nutella on the inside. Boston Cream was good but I prefer Dunkin's more actually. Definitely have to try the Hibiscus one next time after seeing all the rave behind it. Highly recommend!"
3543,"COVID 19 Status- Picked up the donuts in store but they are available for online order through Uber Eats, Postmates etc.We got the Hibiscus, Black Currant, Red Velvet cheesecake, Nutella filled and Mocha Almond. If you like cake donuts, you will LOVE this place like I do! My favorite was the Nutella filled because I am a big chocoholic but my sister really liked the Hibiscus one. I thought it was good too even though I am not a big fan of fruity flavors. The Red Velvet Cheesecake was yummy too and the Mocha almond was great as well but nothing extraordinary like the others I mentioned. I wasn't a big fan of the Black Currant and neither was my sister.The donuts are on a pricey side- about 4 something per donut but I can't wait to go back and try the Chocolate Peanut Butter and some of the other flavors."
3544,"Delicious doughnuts in Chelsea that are massive. Essentially cake in consistency, be prepared to split one"
3545,"Amazing donuts! I got there right in the knick of time too cause it got extremely crowded quick. Very interesting and unique flavor profiles, but the doughy flakey texture of the donuts was what took the cake for me. It was like a pillowy work of art. My favorite was probably just the chocolate glazed (which they definitely called something more fancy but it was just a chocolate glaze in my opinion), but they were all very amazing! From a Chicagoan, I commend Dough for their work!"
3546,The doughnuts here are amazing. Very sweet and unique flavors to choose from. They taste more like cakes than a doughnut. Goes great with black coffee to counter the sweetness.
3547,Are you feeling blue? Need a pick me up? Go here! Omg these doughnuts will immediately lift your spirits! I think these may be the best doughnuts I have had in New York City period. You cannot feel sad while taking a bite out of one of these!
3548,"Above and Beyond! I appreciate these guys a trillion. I called and asked if I can get Happy Birthday donuts same day; I was told no it has to be ordered 24 hours in advance. I totally understood the policy. So I tried my luck and sent an email to ""inquire"" about receiving donuts same day. I received a response from Vicky within 5 minutes asking if I wanted my donuts customized and if I wanted to pick my flavors or assorted. I chose assorted and stuck with the Happy Birthday donuts. Vicky was straight to the point and very prompt in her responses which I loved; felt like we were texting instead of emailing. Doughnuts were ready by the time I made my 45 minute trip into the city. THEY WERE DELICIOUS!!! The flavors were just as amazing as there customer service. My wife loooved the donuts. Happy wife, happy life! We'll be back!"
3549,"Truely, i don't understand how this store get 4 star review so far. I was so disappointed their donuts. I got 2 donuts but dounkin dounts is much better in terms of quality and price. A donut price is $4.5?? It is ridiculous.Go to DD."
3550,"I needed lunch and I needed it fast. That's when I stumbled on Il Bambino. A cute little cafe away from the hustle and bustle of Steinway. When I walked in (with foggy glasses) I was greeted by the staff behind the counter. Not knowing what exactly I wanted I engaged in a conversation with the host/server and she was very helpful with her recommendations.  After careful consideration of the menu I landed on a crostini with rosemary ricotta cheese, tomato and olive spread. I did not stop there. I also ordered a panini with prosciutto, mozzarella, arugula and olive spread (yes I love my olive spread). I dined in so after showing my vax card, I sat in the dining area and waited for my food. The back has a cute small seating area. Some of the walls had photos while one wall has a bunch of handwritten recipes which look to be done by kids from a local school. How cute is this?  Water was brought to my table and shortly after my crostini. Omg was it delish. The ricotta was smooth, the tomato fresh and the olive spread was perfection. Not long after my panini came and boy was it good!  Between the friendly service and the amazing food, I feel like I might be a frequent diner get. And on my next visit, I'll need to see if they really have the best brownie ever, as advertised. I definitely need to be the judge of that."
3551,"Wow. Must of been the best panini --I've ever ate! I ordered their notorious PIG = bacon, egg, cheese + truffle. It's was crunchy, tasty and ohhh so good. The fillings were Perfectly proportioned. Just enough ooze for the breakfast sandwich. I only ate half so it's good enough to be split- if you want to try their other sandwiches.Will definitely come Back for more."
3552,"I never thought a panini could change my life but HOT DAMN BAMBINO ya did me dirty, in the best possible way.Came for brunch and had the Notorious PIG. Perfection. Every bit of it. I also asked for the chili hot sauce on the side and it just added to the overall epicness of the meal. Side note, their baby string bean appetizer may sound weird, but it was amazing. Don't knock it till you try it. They offer flavors for their mimosas - regular, passion fruit, and guava. I had guava and it was delicious. Cannot wait to come back and try more paninis."
3553,"SHEEEEESHHHHH they got some good paninis.I'm not someone that has ever found myself craving paninis or any sandwich for the matter but Il Bambino has changed me.I got their roast mushroom panini even though I'm not a vegetarian or anything. I'm just a fan of mushrooms and this panini was gently sweet, savory, creamy from the cheese, and packed with mushroom umami. My partner got their Notorious P. I. G. panini and that was good as well but we both ended up loving the roast mushroom more.Def gonna start coming back more often.No pic bc we already ate everything."
3554,"I have to say, they make the best paninis I have ever tasted in my life! I got myself the Il Bambs Cubano and the Roasted Mushroom Panini. They were both extremely good. Will definitely order again when i'm on the go"
3555,"Went on a Thursday night and it was fairly empty, but the food is amazing. I assume it's more of a grab and go place since they specialize in paninis. The outside dining looks cute, but it was a bit chilly when we went, so we opted to sit indoors. The sandwiches are very filling and delicious. I can't believe this was only my first time here as I always pass by, but finally made the stop."
3556,"This place has become a mainstay of Astoria. Been here over ten years and in Astoria where restaurants open and close so that is saying something. The owner and his beautiful wife are old school hosts who serve a unique product. The paninis are the best around and their soups of the day are THE best I've ever had.Highly, highly recommend this establishment."
3557,"I checked them out on Instagram to see what panini flavors they have. Saw something they posted and it looked so good. Needless to say, what I got was nothing like the pictures they post on Instagram... but it was still very tasty. They didn't have Senor P on the menu when I went but I told the staff what kind of ingredients I wanted and she suggested making Senor P. I can't remember what exactly was in there but I believe it was chicken, red pepper, cheese, and their special sauce. The panini was definitely big enough for two meals. Would come back again to try more panini and crostini! Very convenient takeout meal"
3558,"The best sandwiches I've ever had. Period. Full stop. No more elaboration needed....but I'll give some anyway.The panini's are cooked to perfection. Super crispy bread, yet soft on the inside when you bite. All of the sandwiches elements are high quality and the combinations of flavors are super well thought out. I've tried multiple sandwiches and crostini's and never had one that I haven't enjoyed. I've also brought many people here over the years and they've always been pleasantly surprised about just how good a seemingly simple panini can be. My number one my favorite one is the Roast Chicken - with house-made spicy mayo, arugula, and mozzarella. An example of a sandwich with only a few ingredients, that other places make often - yet somehow is 1000x better here than anywhere else. They truly focus on each ingredient and it shows. My favorite crostini has goat cheese, honey, and rosemary. So, I recommend those items but I can honestly say if something looks good to you - order it - it will be great.So sad that the location in Manhattan closed, but happy the original location in Astoria remains. (Thankfully Astoria knows the legendary hidden gem it has.) I really hope people get takeout and delivery enough to keep this place open through the pandemic."
3559,Hair in sandwich---------------- thought it was cheeseSaw Mouseslow slow servicenasty waiter/order womancustomers talking right into face not six feet apart not maskedpushing into oneneed crowd control
3560,Delicious food and excellent service. I will be back. Mom was happy. I had the beet salad & mom a Cuban panini. Looking forward to trying different things on the menu.
3561,"I generally don't enjoy sandwiches... but I could eat these paninis any day of the week! They are well-balanced in flavor, chewy inside but toasted and crisp on the outside, flat enough to actually fit into your mouth unlike other sandwiches where they expect you to open up 3 inches wider than a crocodile.Also I have had most salads from the menu and all of them are unique with just the right amount of dressing.I have never had anything I did not enjoy. And I have never been disappointed by the service. Plus the backyard is a nice spot to eat and relax."
3562,"Il Bambino is the best. I couldn't imagine how panini's could be so special, but damn Il Bambino knows how to make a sandwich. I've had all of the panini's and they are all pretty solid, but my favorite is the Sir Oink-A-Lot like they made it before the pandemic with pesto and caramelized onions (they will make it for you if you ask). Next in line for me is the basic grilled chicken and the meatloaf (never would have guessed I love this one, but its great). We usually share two sandwiches between the two of us and end up stuffed. Whenever I've ordered crostini, I've wished I just went with the panini, so I don't super recommend them. They are good to-go but they also have nice indoor and outdoor space if you want to eat in."
3563,"Cuisine: 6Service: 7Decor: 7Value: 7Overall: 7Once upon a time, there was this unique little shop serving crostini and panini that made me travel far distances without a blink of an eye. Now, that place no longer exists. In its place is a store by the same name, but the food is nothing like I remembered.It wasn't bad, just nothing special. Most of the crostini we ordered were just average, with a touch of truffle. Should have skipped the weekend brunch paninis and ordered more of their classics like Porchetta or Roasted Mushrooms.On a high note, still the same great Peanut Butter Hot Chocolate. I'll be back to give them another chance simply because I need this drink in my life."
3564,"I had a pannini there and was ok, but not what I expected from a place on such a location"
3565,"Great backyard area. Excellent food, excellent service. I really love the chicken salad with dirty chips panini!"
3566,I love this place. Everything I've ordered from them has been delicious and fresh. The crostini and panini are delicious and portions generous. I love that they have been offering oat milk as a dairy alternative for quite a while. The staff is friendly and attentive. One of my favorite places to visit in Astoria!
3567,"I ordered the mushroom panini and potato salad to go for dinner on a Friday night and was not disappointed. The mushroom panini was amazing. The bread was perfectly toasted and the chips that were mixed in with the mushrooms added a great crunch! I was a little disappointed with the potato salad. I loved the mixture of ingredients but I felt like it was drowning in mayonnaise. Initially my boyfriend didn't like it, but he said it grew on him and ended up finishing it.The place itself was cute and gave me lunch time vibes. Would definitely come back for the panini and to try their desserts and coffee."
3568,"I tried to support a few local spots during covid, but I tried to support this place a number of times. Love the food, love the staff, love the vibe... go check it out, but stop telling people outside of Astoria about it!"
3569,"Love this place!Paninis are absolutely delicious!!! We had so many of them, but hands down our favorite one is the charred  broccoli. There is an outside patio in the back with excellent service."
3570,"I've always loved this place before the pandemic.  However, with the omicron craze to walk in and see NO ONE wear a mask while making food, taking orders, serving food is beyond shocking.  When questioned by another customer, they completely ignored it as if handling food without a mask is completely fine especially now.  Dine at your own risk."
3571,"Now when I want a sandwich, THIS is what I'm talking about. I've had their love handles panini which had eggs, chorizo, dirty chips, tuscan cheese spread, and spicy mayo - absolute perfection. I wish I lived closer to Il Bambino as it would have been my go-to sandwich spot. They have a nice backyard seating area for when you want to dine in. Lovely service, casual vibes. Check this place out if you can!"
3572,Best Panini I've tried. Really really good. This place it's a MUST! Please order a beer with it.
3573,This is one of our go to spots to order brunch as we love the paninis. in person however it is also adorable and cozy and has a nice cozy back area that was unexpected!
3574,"My expectations were high, but was underwhelmed overall. But I haven't been able to find a good panini spot in NYC though, so 4 stars it is! I ordered the ""Sweet Sausage"" panini, smoked tomato bisque soup, and iced espresso macchiato. I also got the raspberry linzer tart for dessert.Starting with the soup--the soup was pretty good, and might be my top item in my order. The soup came with a panini with pesto aioli in it. The bread a bit harder to chew through than my regular order of panini, but otherwise was good.The iced espresso macchiato did not travel well. When I opened the bags, I was confused for a moment because I thought it was an iced coffee. There was way too much ice in the cup. I'm not sure if it was a single or double, but regardless, it was delivered in a large cup that was rim full of ice. WAY too much ice whether it was for one or two shots of espresso. The espresso was extremely watered down because of that.The Sweet Sausage panini comes with the sweet sausage, onion jam, hot peppers, rosemary aioli, and Monterey cheese, but I think the rosemary aioli was missing. The sausage flavor I think was a bit too overpowering for my liking. The balance of flavors was a bit off for me. The panini bread and onion jam tasted great though. I'd be interested in trying a panini with onion jam and maybe another protein or just cheese. I'll have to try a different panini next time.Finally for the dessert, I was pretty underwhelmed. The raspberry linzer tart missed the mark for me and I was unable to finish it. The flavor and texture of the cookie was underwhelming and a bit too hard. The raspberry filling was fine but the cookie did not support it."
3575,Paltry portions and a 45 minute wait for two paninis.  They had one guy working the press on a Saturday afternoon.. very peculiar.  Ordered whatever sandwich had the king fu aioli..  only memorable because it didn't have any Asian flavors at all and could barely add moisture to the dried out shredded pork.  The prosciutto panini was also underwhelming. Any salty fatty goodness that is prosciutto was lost in all that bread. Thx for refreshing my memory Elizabeth!
3576,"My coworker implored me to try this place before I moved. Lord will I miss moving further from this place!Stumbled in here on a Sunday and the manager, Daniel, warmly welcomes me. I take a seat at the bar and he offers me the most popular paninis. I went with the Lard Have Mercy, (Sweet sausage, Tomato pesto, Scrambled eggs, Devil peppers and Goat cheese.). The sandwich had lots of umami and was well balanced. The goat cheese didn't overpower the sandwich. The meat to bread ratio was on point!Boy did this place changed my mind about paninis! I will never look at the usual deli's turkey cheddar panini again. If you are a non panini believer like me, this place will change your mind! Will have to come back to this place again and try the crustini with goat cheese, honey and rosemary aioli.Cheers"
3577,"This is one of those places where it's a must-go if you love paninis. I have to say that it's up to par with some of the paninis in Italy (and if you're flying to Italy, it's usually for pizza, not panini). I think the reason why is that their bread is consistently good, light in ingredients with the crunchy exterior contrasting the soft interior. That's how you make good bread (IMO, YMMV).Also, I really like the outdoor seating. It reminds me of Europe, where there's a lot of outdoor seating (primarily because of smokers), so it's great during the mild weather months to have a panini outside. I kinda wish more restaurants would follow this model.So we tried to Brunch Paninis:- My Boyfriend is a Pig: Goat cheese very prominent in flavor, crunchy breakfast bite.- Pig in Japan: You came for the prosciutto, you left yearning for more mozzarella."
3578,"Incredible food, relaxing atmosphere, friendly and efficient service. I absolutely love this place. Good selection for vegetarians, and really good coffee 10/10 for il bambino!!"
3579,"This is just simply my favorite place to eat in queens. We have been going there for years and it's just the most reliable sandwich ive ever had. They have a great menu, but I always get the same thing because it's just that darn good. Just go here. There's no reason not to."
3580,"I love this place. This place has some of the best sandwiches in Queens and the food is always consistent and yummy. I tend to stick with the classic Mozzarella sandwich, but I get a side of the lawless spicy mayo to dip my sandwich in and the combo is out of this world, good. My husband's favorites are the avocado and broccoli sandwich. We've come here with people who also eat meat, and they've had nothing but positive reviews for their sandwiches. This is a place that we'll keep coming to because their quality is great and its consistent. We've yet to have a bad experience over the many times we've taken their sandwiches to go and also when we've eaten there. One tip though is to avoid ordering them through Seamless/GrubHub. It's more expensive. You're better off calling them on the phone and ordering because they charge about $1 more per sandwich on those websites."
3581,"The food here is CONSISTENT and DELICIOUS! I've been here several times over the last few years and can't believe I never got around to write a reviewMy favorites are the brunch paninis: Getting Piggy With It, Swine to Shrine and Lard Have Mercy (discontinued but you can always request it). The bread is toasted to perfection with a nice crunch. Their sandwiches are stuffed with fresh ingredients. The scrambled eggs are always fluffy and the meats are never dry. One sandwich can easily be shared between 2 if you plan on ordering sides/appetizers. I highly recommend the fingerling potato salad. It's so addictive. The crostinis were great too."
3582,I loooove Il Bambino! They have the best panini in all of NYC! The roast mushroom is my favorite. I also love the tomato bisque soup they usually have on Wednesdays and Saturdays!
3583,I love love love Il Bambino. Everything I've had here is delicious from the meat and cheese plates to the panini's you really can't go wrong.
3584,"Il Bambino made for a great lunch spot on a holiday Monday. My boyfriend and I shared a Goat cheese and fig spread crostini, Speck panini and Roast chicken panini. I also got a Toffee oatmeal cookie but wasn't a fan - it was way too hard. We both had a sample of the brownie on the way out and it was incredible, should have gotten that instead."
3585,"Delicious variety of panini and a fantastic spot for an afternoon drink or two with friends - we prefer to post up at either the bar up front or the chill yard in the back. If you are fortunate enough to find yourself there during brunch in particular or are looking for a delicious breakfast to go, I could not recommend a Sir Oink-a-Lot and an iced coffee more. The best way to spoil oneself on a lazy weekend morning, I've been so obsessed with Sir Oink-a-Lot I've been unable to will myself to order anything else (from their brunch menu, that is) since trying it for the first time years ago. It's savory, sweet, and all brought together by their signature panini bread that is crispy on the outside yet has a bit of chew on the inside.The wine selection is not large, but thoughtfully curated by the owner - who is very nice and will check in on guests from time to time. The salads and antipasti offered are all very satisfying complements to the wine and panini during lunch and dinner.The only thing that would perfect the experience would be the addition of a gluten-free bread substitute for any of the panini. It's not an issue for me personally but I feel like my gluten-free friends (and fiancé) are missing out on a core component of the experience.Il Bambino is excellent, you won't find a better panini anywhere."
3586,"I am impressed, Il Bambino is actually rather darn cool. Loved the atmosphere, and style of the decor. Everything on the menu seemed really good, especially Speck. The staff was really friendly and service is exceptional. It truly was a terrific experience."
3587,"So delicious! Best paninis ever made and such creative combinations, too. A staple in Astoria. Highly recommend. Yum!!"
3588,"Loved loved this place! All their panini's looked amazing. They have a special menh selection for the weekend and holidays. My friend and I walked in and there was a wait. It was raining and I saw there were more seats out in the back but because of the rain, it wasn't open. We waited about 20 minutes to get seated. The workers there are nice and cool, we got our water right away. They have so many selections to choose from. We selected: The Love Handles: scrambled eggs, chorizo, dirty chips, tuscan cheese spread, spicy mayo - soo good with the extra crunch from the chips! The other panini: The Shrine to Swine: porchetta, scrambled eggs, onion jam, aged cheddar, cracked pepper aioli! The panini's are pretty damn big.  Highly rec!"
3589,"Heavenly soft scramble eggs, perfectly seasoned and balanced ingredients, and impeccably crunchy pressed bread - this place's totally upped my panini game. (I don't even normally write reviews, but Il Bambino deserves one.)"
3590,My fav spot for panini ; they never disappoint. They have good vegetarian options . I
3591,dont read reviews on this place ... just get off ur butt and go!  now!!
3592,Yoooo I love this place. They have the best pork sandwiches. They also have some good sweets as well. Try the el Porko royale or any of the ones with egg. Those are my favorite. Benne benne
3593,This is one of the places your Italian friends will tell you to go in Astoria. The panini is solid and they don't skimp.
3594,"My FAVORITE restaurant in Astoria for over 12 years and counting. They have the best panini and crostini bread I've ever had. Their fingerling potato salad is a must. Their antipasti platter is amazing. When you can eat in, hopefully it's warm enough to eat outside and you forget you're in an urban neighborhood. This is great for a date, to bring family or to go out and split a lot of crostinis with friends. I can't sing their praises enough. Right now they're still open on weekends with a limited menu, but take advantage. I just had their chicken panini and panna cotta and it was stellar. Their tuscan and squash soups are also amazing when they offer them too!"
3595,"There is nothing at this restaurant that isn't a slam dunk. It has ruined me for other paninis and hot chocolates, and they make the only soup I like. I go here for valentine's day, dinner with visitors, my birthday, and days where I need a pick me up. They have a beautiful little back patio. The inclusion of a few of the brunch paninis on the daily/weekday menu has been a bright spot in these bizarre times. There was a close call earlier this year when they were going to close and it seemed like half the neighborhood showed up for takeout, and then for a while they were a one man panini operation. Calling ahead for pickup is super easy, theyre also on Caviar, and the menu is posted to instagram daily."
3596,"The panini here is really so good!!! I know all the reviews says it's good, but I was still skeptical - like how good can t really be? But it really was delicious! Definitely delivered! Not hype. It is good portion. It is panini only. Comeswith no sides, but I was definitely very full. The bread was perfection. It was crispy outside and chewy inside. The sauce to my chicken chorizo sandwich was savory and a bit sweet. Lots of protein! So filling to bread ratio was perfect. It was also perfect amount of cheesy goodness! I would definitely come back!"
3597,They're making old favorites upon request and have improved service. It's a neighborhood staple
3598,"I ended up trying this place out one weekend for takeout.  Was always thinking about trying the place out for a year or so, but never got the chance to do so.With the recommendation of some reviewers, I decided to try the Avocado Panini.  It took about 15 minutes for takeout, which was pretty quick in my opinion.  Taste-wise, the panini was excellent!  I don't normally like mushrooms, but it went well with the avocado, mozzarella, and aioli.  It also was a pretty generous portion so I didn't crave anything afterwards.   I'd definitely consider ordering from this place again."
3599,Simply the best panini in New York. I wish I could learn their secret. They always use the best ingredient and Il Bambino is one of our favorite places in Astoria.
3600,Went back last week and their Paninis still rock! One of my favorite spots in Astoria! Good price too (about 11 bucks for a tasty panini)
3601,"I am not the one who would usually go for food that requires me to touch it, hence, a panini! However, I must say that this place is worth getting your hands dirty for! My partner-in-crime and I arrived about 20 minutes before opening and stalking the doors until they are opened. To our surprise, we were not the only customers as the tables quickly fill up. To satisfy our hunger, we ordered the Pupu Platter which comes with your choice of 6 Crostini and the Sir Oink-a-lot, their infamous brunch panini. We also got coffee to go with all this goodness.For the Pupu Platter, this is probably the best thing to get for first timers to get a taste of the different varieties of crostini. We got the following: (1) Mozzarella, Tomato Pesto, Fried Shallot, Lawless' Spicy Mayo; (2) Truffle Egg Salad and Shaved Speck; (3) Chorizo, Apricot Butter, Goat Cheese; (4) Smoked Bacon, Cracked Pepper Aioli, Manchego; (5) Salume Tartufo, Rosemary Ricotta, chestnut honey; and the (6) Parmesan, Basil Pesto, Fresh Tomato, and Chili Oil. Our favorites had to be the pesto ones, love them! Each piece was a nice combination of flavors of protein, cheese, vegetable, herbs, spices, sauce, and of course, their awesome soft, crispy bread.Sir Oink-a-lot. Grilled panini bread was so crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, this was the best part! Tasty combination flavors of the soft eggs, sweet sausage, and pesto. I would just add a tad more salt on the egg. Coffee was okay. Go for the Guava Mimosa instead!"
3602,"Me and my boyfriend LOVEEE this place, this is our go to Sunday brunch/lunch spot. The ingredients are fresh, service can be slow depending on how many people are there but overall very impressed with the taste/service/price. Would recommend this place for people who love panini. They also have good salad selections."
3603,"So sad to not see pork chopper on their menu anymore, that panini was delicious. Hope to see it again soon"
3604,Had lunch here today and very much enjoyed the experience. The food was decent and the lady behind the counter was very friendly. I will definitely return!
3605,"We had the pupu platter (goat cheese and fig spread, mushroom truffle butter, chorizo apricot, marinated artichoke with rosemary ricotta and smoked bacon goatcheese and spicy mayo) they were all delicious! Will definitely come back!"
3606,I came here with my fiancé the other day and we loved the paninis! Lots of flavor and the staff was very nice.
3607,"We came here wanting something relatively light and ordered the roasted mushroom panini, the Tuscan cheese spread panini, and the egg salad crostini with fontina and chive oil. In order of yumminess: the crostini came in first with its perfectly super super crunchy but still somewhat chewy bread, the roasted mushroom panini, and then the Tuscan cheese spread panini, which was okay, but we probably wouldn't get again. Next time we go, I'm definitely going to be focusing on trying out some more of their crostinis, which I liked better than the paninis. Oh btw- if you don't eat pork, you have like 3 panini options on the menu, unless you ask them to leave it out. The menu is extremely pork heavy, which was expected, given their sign and logo lol."
3608,"Number of Visits: 2Il Bambino is the one spot that focuses on paninis and offers you a variety of melts that is pressed until the cheese is oooey hot. Quite frankly, I just wasn't too impressed with the sandwiches. Some were really strong in flavor and others not so much which all depended on the ingredient.The menu is broken down as simple as possible for you to understand it which is very helpful for first-timers. They tell you where each meat and cheese is from so you can find your combo. There is seating indoors and outdoors, but service is a tad bit slow in my opinion. The staff is busy out back where the crowd is so if you're the only one hanging out inside, there is a tad bit of neglect."
3609,"Well, this was the meal that defeated me...yes, I only ate half of the panini. It wasn't because it wasn't good---it was delicious! But here's a tip: Don't go to Il Bambino for brunch after eating a bagel slathered in cream cheese for breakfast. You will need to bring your appetite to eat here! We sat outside on a beautiful day in their backyard patio oasis. It was absolutely lovely and perfect. I had the ""Sir Oink a Lot"" panini (love those names btw). It was $13 and included sweet sausage, scrambled eggs, caramelized onions, basil pesto, and fontina cheese). Scrumptious...I mean, how can you go wrong with copious amounts of meat and cheese? My one critique would be that I wish there was more of the pesto. We also tried the spicy pickles ($3), and they were ok, I think I just prefer regular good old dill pickles though. Definitely check this place out if you're hungry and want to try a more unique brunch experience!"
3610,"This restaurant was simply amazing! I'd gotten a recommendation for this place, and it really lived up to the hype!My friend and I ordered a lasagna flight as an ""appetizer"" since we really wanted to try it, and they were so tasty! Cheesy, and perfect! We also got the calzones which were very much large but we brought our (significant quantity) of leftovers home so that we could enjoy them for another meal or two! We were so full that we couldn't fit dessert (rookie mistake), but that just means that there will have to be a next time!The garden area was also really quite beautiful to sit in. The decor really transported me back to pre-covid times when I visited in Italy, and I would totally come back here. They market this place to be very romantic (which it definitely could be), but they really cater to all different groups! ie I saw business men/women, friends, and families all here too! They were opening the roof when we were there, and a few leaves and flowers were falling down onto us/into our water. I didn't mind it, though, because it was really channeling the authentic Italian experience for me!I definitely recommend this place. I will certainly be returning and leave room for dessert!"
3611,"Came here for a late lunch with a friend and sat in the back garden. Such a cute set up- you feel like you're in Italy.We decided to try the lasagna flight which consisted of 4 small samples of lasagna:-Bolognese (Tomato Meat Sauce, Bechamel & Parmigiano) -Salsiccia e Rapini (Sauteed Broccoli Rabe, Pork Sausage, Bechamel, Parmigiano) -Pancetta, Cavolfiore e Piselli (Sauteed Califlower,Italian Bacon, Bechamel, Parmigiano) -Peperone Rosso,Gambero e Carciofi (Roasted Red Pepper Sauce, Marinated Artichoke, Sauteed Shrimp, Bechamel, Parmigiano)The lasagna flight was perfect to share and get to try the different flavors/seasoning.  We also shared a pizza w chorizo. Everything was delish and filling. Our waiter was nice and attentive although we did feel a little rushed towards the end but on a Saturday afternoon I'm sure they had a lot of reservations. That didn't take away from the delish food. I would come back and try their other pizzas selections and the lasagna. Chefs kiss."
3612,"I just really wanted some wine and cheese. 90% of what I eat is really just a response to my cravings. Normally I crave healthy foods. Today it was cheese. You can do just cheese or just meat. (3 cheeses for 15 or 2 meats for 14) so we got both. For the cheese we got fontina, chèvre rondín, and manchego. It comes with a basket of focaccia crisps, and wow. Flavorful cheeses with beautiful texture, and the salted crisps!!!  so good. For the 2 meats we got salami toscano and smoked prosciutto. I knew the prosciutto was going to be good but the salami?! Rich and Smokey. Loved it. Then we got a calzone. Perfect size, super cheesy, and delicious chicken inside. The service and hospitality was perfect, very accommodating to my small requests (moved us to sit in the garden and changed a drink I didn't like), and the garden was lovely. This place gives me family owned vibes, and I loved that. Except for the bees. So I didn't personally get stung but we saw someone potentially get stung. Just know that a few bees roam around so many this place is best closer to night time. Also the Lychee Martini I wasn't a fan of, and their wine by the glass selection was decent."
3613,"Blown away by the quality of the pizza here. The place is really big, the first floor is tiny, but the basement is much bigger and has a beautiful bar and fire place (not sure if it's functional, but very ornate), they also have an awesome back patio and front outdoor seating booths. I went with two friends on a Saturday night and we were able to make a reservation for 8 pm and were seated right away and the basement area was pretty much empty. We each ordered a pizza and shared a salad, which was fine but nothing special. The pizza is really the star, the crust was perfectly fluffy and flavorful, lots of cheese and toppings, and was definitely more than enough food for one person. And relatively cheap for the amount of food. Each pizza was between $20-25, salad was under $20 and wine was $10 per glass. The wine we got was supposed to be either a Pinot griot or a sauv blanc but it was waaaay too sweet. The only regret of the evening. Can't wait to come back!"
3614,"Definitely sit in the garden room with the beautiful huge lanterns. Their menu is quite extensive but for drinks, definitely go for one of the martinis (watermelon was my fave). I'm indecisive, so the ""lasagna flight"" was perfect. It's 4 small pieces of different lasagnas. Along with that I got the pizza arrabiatta (delicious) and shared with 2 other people. I could see this being a fabulous choice for a romantic dinner!"
3615,"Average the food was prepared, nothing special. The drinks were average. Affordable. Would recommend for a group party but not a date night dinner."
3616,"I wanted to like this place, I really did.  I was looking for an outdoor dining spot with heaters to meet my friend for early dinner.  We found this spot and made a 5PM reservation in the indoor heated patio (note, everyone who enters the establishment has to show proof of vaccination). We were placed in a two seater with my seat right next to an unwieldy lamp.  On the right of us (less than 2 feet away) was a party of 5 crammed around a two seater.  On the left and behind us were numerous empty two seaters.  As soon as I sat down, I asked the waitress if we could move to one of the empty tables or move the lamp - she said no to both.  We assumed they had specific plans for those tables (maybe a larger party where they'd combine them) so I did my best to shift my chair so I wasn't right up next to the lamp.  For a good hour, none of the tables around us were taken, while we remained crammed right next to this party of 5.  Normally I wouldn't mind, but in times of social distancing, especially in an indoor venue, I was very uncomfortable.  Thankfully this party left, but they eventually seated two people at each of the other tables and I wondered why they couldn't just move us when we asked?  We were there a good hour early before those others.  Makes no sense.Aside from the seating issue, the food and service were good.  I liked that there was a wide variety of choices on the menu, from salads to pizza to wine. We debated getting the lasagna flight (4 or 8 lasagnas) but instead opted for the red pepper bruschetta, arugula salad with shaved parmesan, and the prosciutto pizza to split between us. Our glasses of sangiovese and chianti wine were the perfect pairing. By the time we left at 7pm, the place was hopping, I'm glad we came early despite the seating issues.  Looked like several groups waiting out front to be seated, and the main floor, garden, and downstairs (where the bathrooms were) were fully occupied.If I came back, I would pick an off-time and maybe sit out front in the enclosed structures on the sidewalk - the garden had a nice ambience with dim lighting and plants, but was not as socially distant as I'd like."
3617,"Sometimes you just want some food that tastes like your Italian grandmother made it, and that's why you go to this place! All the lasagnas were fantastic and I would highly recommend ordering the flight. I also really liked the cheese board. The tiramisu tasted a little liquer-ish which wasn't for me, but you should order it if that's your thing. The cappuccino, however, was probably the best I've ever had. Make sure to get some whip cream on it!"
3618,"A hidden gem in the middle of NYC, with a ""secret garden"" so beautiful and unique that you will literally forget that you're in one of the loudest and busiest cities in the world. This place has the most expansive drink menu you will ever see. You will literally not know how to choose. The cocktails are fantastic, the service is friendly and wonderful, and the ambiance can't be beat. If you haven't been here yet, change that immediately. Have a romantic afternoon date here in the secret garden, and get a little tipsy off amazing cocktails."
3619,"Loved my experience here! I dined with a friend in the outdoor garden in the back on a Thursday evening. Make sure to make a reservation if you'd like to sit back here since it's small. The patio unfortunately is not covered, so if it's raining, you'll get wet. They also have small glass private houses in the front of the restaurant on the street, which I believe you also need a reservation for. Everything is VERY reasonably priced and there's a huge variety! I was blown away by the service! Everyone was super friendly and attentive! My water glass was never half empty. We ordered the white pizza with caramelized onions and goat cheese along with the pesto lasagna to share. I was surprised at how light the pesto lasagna was and you could tell the noodles were homemade. We ordered some salami/prosciutto with focaccia bread crisps for an app. The table next to use got the bruschetta, which were huge pieces of bread with many toppings. We wished we had opted for that since it looked like it was well worth the $11 for 3 pieces. Overall, I'll definitely be back! The ambience was great, service was top notch, food was delicious and overall a very pleasant experience! I highly recommend!"
3620,"My friends and I were looking for a place to get dinner without having made any reservations beforehand. We decided on La Lanterna when one of us mentioned having eaten here and enjoying the pesto lasagna. We were pleasantly surprised when the hostess welcomed us immediately and brought us to our seats. I remember being taken aback by how spacious the restaurant was as it had outdoor seating and more seats downstairs. The interior is very dimly lit which made for a nice ambience. Of course, I had to give the lasagna a try. We ordered the pesto one, a calzone, pizza, and tiramisu. It was a dinner filled with cheese and by the end of it all three of us felt more than satiated. Without a doubt, my favorite was the pesto lasagna; the cheesy goodness and pesto flavor still lingers as I recall the memory. The pizza was good. It didn't stun me like the lasagna but I would give it a try if it is your first time. As for the calzone, definitely try it with the sauce provided in order to add another layer of flavor. The tiramisu wasn't too sweet and we finished it easily. I would recommend coming here with at least one or two other people just so everyone can share and get a taste of the different menu items."
3621,"My absolute favorite Italian spot in NYC. The garden. The ambience. The food. And the lanterns, all of it makes for a great meal regardless of the i Cassini"
3622,Can't say much about the food since I only got an Arnold Palmer but the ambiance was super nice. The lanterns are gorgeous and it has an indoor-outdoor feel. Would love to come back and try the food one day!
3623,"Really enjoyed our meal. The lasagna flight is such a cute idea and great deal. We came here on an early Sat afternoon and was able to sit in the back ""garden."" Definitely try to request a table there if you can. Their menu has a huge assortment with all different kinds of pizzas that would probably satisfy everyone's taste buds. It got busier later in the afternoon and there were only 1 or 2 servers running around checking on the tables. They have outdoor seating with heaters as well if you prefer that. I do want to note that all the servers / staff were wearing masks except for the owner / manager and he was just going around tables and chatting with people.."
3624,"Finally got to try out this gorgeous Italian restaurant and was not disappointed! We made reservations for outside patio seating in their garden on a Friday evening. Upon arrival, we were promptly seated. The garden was small but they managed to fit a good amount of tables there. The big colorful lamps made it a whimsical and magical night.My boyfriend and I shared the pomodoro bruschetta. It was good and I highly recommend eating it with some balsamic vinegar and olive oil. I ordered the pesto lasagna and wow, it's as delicious as everyone says it is!  The beschamel sauce gave the delicious flavor of pesto a light creamy flavor that's somewhat sweet. The melted cheese was not over done and brought the whole dish together.My boyfriend ordered the margherita pizza and it was a good size. I took a bite and thought it tasted like a pretty descent margherita pizza but I was very happy with my lasagna. We both ordered martinis. They ran out of the passion fruit so we tried the peach, raspberry, and lychee. The lychee martini was great and really strong.Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant and would love to come back for their amazing pesto lasagna and martinis"
3625,This place is a gem open late and nice ambiance . The pizza was delicious. Perfect crust a little chewy and crunchy. I enjoyed the lasagna sampler as well.
3626,"Great Italian restaurant if you're in this part of NYC. We got the Roasted red pepper bruschetta with goat cheese 5/5, would recommend the other tomato one if you're in a group of 4 because it comes with 4 breads. The mushroom arrabbiata pizza was excellent, flavorful sauce and fresh crust!! The pesto lasagne with added black truffle was delicious, probably what this place is know for. It'll make you want to order a second right away, but it is very filling, so don't make the same mistake I did because you won't have room for it :). Unless you're obsessed with pungent cheese, I would not get the gorgonzola pizza. The drink menu is a little restricted. I got a mojito, but it was extremely sugary.They have indoor and outdoor seating at this time!"
3627,"I've been to La Lanterna Di Vitoria a while ago last winter. The food was phenomenal then. We came back a few nights ago and the ambiance was still there. We tried the Bolognese Lasagna and the Pesto al lasagna. The lasagna wasn't as amazing as last time. There seemed to be less seasoning on the lasagna- almost as if there was no salt. Regardless, still a good lasagna!"
3628,"Best pesto lasagna in the city hands down! The pesto is so flavorful yet not overwhelming. Many pestos leave an uncomfortable after taste, but this is not the case here! Pasta is perfectly al dente and flavors are richly layered. I would not recommend eating in the huts in front of the restaurant, however, as there are individuals who panhandle in front and knock on the doors trying to get money from the diners. This is by no means the fault of the restaurant, so would recommend eating in the back garden to try this delectable food instead!"
3629,"Wow they have the largest menu I've ever seen at any restaurant. So hard to make a decision. Waitstaff was nice and helped us decide. The covid outdoor set up out front was nice and cute with separated bubble booths. Beet salad was very good. Siciliana Pizza was good, but average . For New York, the prices were very cheap for what we got, which was nice and not overpriced"
3630,"We stumbled across this lovely spot After a full day of walking around the city and just wanting a good meal. We didn't think we would get a table considering we had already been turned away at several restaurants. But the owner made it happen and we were so great full because I was starting to give up . We were seated inside just by the window and it definitely looks deceiving from outside. They had little plastic houses and tables outside and the have a back patio area and even more space downstairs. Our server Alexander was super friendly and very attentive to the table . They were super busy so we started off with some meat and cheeses while we waited for our main dishes which we enjoyed. We ordered a few pizzas , bolognese lasagna and arugula salad. All of them were delicious and good flavors . I would definitely recommend this place if you are walking around the village"
3631,"This has been one of my favorite spots for over a decade. It's become more popular and expensive  in recent years due to being featured on buzzfeed and in a number of articles. However, the one thing that has remained the same is the quality of food. Delicious doesn't even begin to describe the dining experience. Now let's get to the important stuff:#1 make a reservation and book a room downstairs if your party is larger than two. The tables outside and in the greenhouse area are too small for a party larger than 2. What to eat:Bruschetta as an appetizer, ya can't go wrong with any option! Main course: the lasagna of course! Although their pizza is great, all New Yorkers know to come for the lasagna. I like the classic lasagna with meat sauce** but my sister had the pesto lasagna(with lamb sausage added- just ask), yum! Just ask for the modifications you'd like as it is all made from scratch! It's baked to perfection!Dessert: tiramisu and for rich dessert - mud cake! You'll leave needing to be rolled out."
3632,"FINALLY made it back for the first time since COVID and so glad to see them busy and full of customers (loyalists I am sure).  They now have these cozy patio enclosures outside in addition to the garden and indoor seating.  The garden is not yet air conditioned so it can be very warm on a hot day.The food is as great as ever and it was my first time trying the lasgane pesto, which was delectable.  It has about 10 layers of tender pasta sandwiched with pesto and topped with mozzarella - basically the Lady M version of lasagne.  It is flavorful yet not quite as heavy as the bolognese or quatro formaggi.  I would definitely recommend trying this!  Our lamb sausage pizza was also fantastic and I can honestly say that the crust here is superb - thin but with an actual thickness around the crust section so that you get the best of both worlds.  I think that I may have used the crust for the residual pesto!  The bruschetta sampler was just okay - the pate was the best of the 3 fo sure - but I am not sure we will return for this dish alone.This is definitely still a must-try in the West Village and I will certainly be back!  Stick to the pizza and lasagne and I promise that you will thank me."
3633,Stopped in for lunch and ordered their Margherita pie. I have to say it was Delious.  Pizza was hot and crispy. I recommend stopping in for a bite.
3634,Man I don't know what it was but the service has gone downhill. Why are you guys filling up the entire place when you realistically only have one server ? The guy was swamped and I don't even blame him.  It took us 30 mins for the waiter to even come to us. It was quite a terrible experience. Food sucked too. There's plenty of better Italian places out there don't bother going here.
3635,"Firstly, loved their outdoor setup! We got the Bruschette (Pomodoro e basilico), Pizza (con salsiccia) and the Pesto Lasagna. The Lasagna was amazing! The other two dishes were reasonable but I wouldn't say they were the best.We also had a couple of desserts - Tiramisu and Zuppa Inglese. Both of them were absolutely delicious and were a nice way to end the meal."
3636,"OMG this is now one of my favorite places!! I've always wanted to come here in my last 8 years in the city, but I only recently decided to stop by here because the outdoor dining set up looked both safe and super cute! First things first. For the impending winter months, there are enough outdoor heaters for each table and there are around 5-6 tables right outside the restaurant. There is also an outdoor garden (I think behind the restaurant?) but I haven't been to that part. Not only are the tables 6 feet apart, but there are plexiglass dividers between them. You also get a hand sanitizer at each table. Very safe setup for covid era dining! We came here for a late lunch on a very cold day this past weekend and the heaters were much needed. We ordered a glass of mulled wine each and split a pizza arrabbiata with onions. The service was fabulous--both the waiter and bartender/server were very attentive. The wine was delicious and well-spiced with ample orange slices, nutmeg, and cinnamon. The pizza was so so good. The crust was the best part--thin and airy but still crispy! All in all, this is an awesome place in the village for some classic pizza and wine, especially if you're looking for a safe and cute outdoor dining experience. I truly wish it hasn't taken me 8 years to try it out!!"
3637,Here I go again with no pictures. (Please forgive me)Where do I begin? So my coworkers and I came here after a night of happy hour drinking that turned into an all night occasion. The staff accommodated us with ease. We got there at 12:15 and the restaurant closed at 1am. Talk about CLUTCH! We were so happy and amazed to have an impromptu midnight snack after binge drinking. The funghi lasagna was amazing! We also ordered the prosciutto pizza and margarita pizza. Both were also delicious. I will definitely be back! Jennifer also was very suggestive and charming! :)Thanks again for accommodating me and my colleagues! Highly recommend 8/10
3638,"Make sure to grab a seat in the garden area! This place is so beautiful but the garden is a whole vibe. The pizza was perfect but honestly their extensive martini menu was it for me. They have every kind of martini you could imagine and they are great. If you come here, get the pizza but stay for a martini or two! Follow me @msmabelmartinez on Instagram + Tik Tok!"
3639,By far the best lasagna I've ever had- perfect amount of spicy and paired great with the focaccia bread. It was easy to make a day of reservation on a sunday night. We were seated by the fireplace on the bottom floor and it was great. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. Only regret is not getting a dessert!
3640,"La Lanterna is an oasis in the city. Go at the right time and you feel transported to another era in the best possible way. The food is fresh, the drinks are plentiful, and everything is well priced. Absolutely love this place."
3641,The best lasagna I've ever eaten before! It is a no frills Italian restaurant that feels very authentic. There's numerous options I went with the pesto lasagna and it was to die forever. Had to stop myself from ordering another one for dessert. Next time I will remember to get reservations and sit at their lovely patio.
3642,"This place has the best pesto lasagna I've ever had! And the restaurant is absolutely stunning! I've been there several times and I always try to get a seat in the back garden. It's beautifully lit at night. And downstairs they have this speakeasy vibe where everyone's cramped together. You can even hear the jazz through the walls from their jazz bar next door. It has a super romantic feel and perfect for date night. Their pesto lasagna is fatty and yummy. Even the waiter recommended this one out of all the others. I don't recommend getting the cheese lasagna because it's has a very one note flavor profile and can be a little on the bland side. The meat lasagna is also great!Their pizza is classic. Highly recommend the Margherita pizza. The tomato sauce they use is sweet and nicely seasoned. I've also had their mushroom pizza which was ok. They don't really do anything special to the mushrooms to enhance the flavor. Their paninis are also great! I've had their traditional mozzarella and tomato panini and it's addicting to eat. Their bread is perfectly crisp, and it comes with a nice side salad! I've also had their calzones and they are gigantic and stuffed with ricotta! Highly recommend! I haven't had much luck with their desserts. Our waiter sold us on the chocolate mud cake saying it was his favorite, which I find hard to believe because it tasted like chocolate fudge cake from the supermarket. It was also stale so he must have been trying to get rid of it. Also don't recommend their gelato because it tastes like ice cream. In fact our waiter accidentally referred to it as ice cream which doesn't comfort me. Their Nutella pizza is the only dessert worth getting in my opinion (if not a bakery item). The ratios are perfect and you can go through half a pie without realizing what you've done!"
3643,"I had not eaten indoors for close to a year, and found myself with a group walking through Washington Square Park on a chilly day, wishing that there was a safe, ventilated, yet warm space to sit and share some lunch together...when I remembered the beautiful, outdoor, back patio at La Lanterna.I walked in to check out the set up and there was in fact a safe, well ventilated table complete with an outdoor heater, for 5 ready and waiting for us.  YES!!!We all had the most lovely time lunching together in the garden.  Most of us started with an excellent bowl of a pesto based minestrone.  Three ordered panini sandwiches which they enjoyed immensely.  I  chose the tomato bruschette, which was excellent.  The tomato topping was on the most delicious buttery grilled bread.  I also ordered a white/pink grapefruit tea, that was unique and delicious.We had a wonderful time!  I absolutely recommend La Lanterna, always, and especially now during this time of social distancing."
3644,Went here for a friend's birthday. We had a lot of people so the seating was a little awkward. I wouldn't recommend it for large groups but the food is great! The pesto lasagna was amazing! I'd recommend splitting it between two people because it was so rich. The mushroom pizza was really good as well.
3645,"Came here about a week ago with my GF for date night. Food:Lasagna Al Pesto: One word, ELITE. This might have to be one of the best Lasagnas I've ever had in my entire life. The bite to the pasta, PERFECT, the pesto sauce, PERFECT, the amount of cheese , PERFECT. The pesto sauce was rich, creamy, and flavorful, combine that with cheese and pasta you get a divine meal.Pizza con Salsiccia w/Hot Pork: The pizza was good. In NYC, pizza shops are a dime a dozen, there's simply so many great spots to go around. While this wasn't my favorite pizza in the city, it was a nice addition to the meal. The hot pork wasn't spicy but gave the pizza an extra touch of flavor that made me enjoy the meal a little more . The crust was crispy and more of a Neapolitan style pizza. Not a must have but definitely worth a try. Atmosphere:The atmosphere is what drew us to this restaurant. We had a reservation for 8:30PM for a seat in the garden. Pro tip, since there are two outdoor seating options for Covid you can state that you want a seat in the garden in your comments during your reservation, barring availability. Even during the cold winter, the outdoor garden was well heated with space heaters. A beautiful, and romantic scene, while me and my GF enjoyed a great Italian dinner. I would highly recommend anyone come here simply for this experience alone. A truly unique and amazing dining experience."
3646,"Amazing lasagna ""flights""!Also, fabulous pizza in a beautiful, relaxing setting. The back garden is magical. Have an Aperol (or two), chat with the owner Vittorio and chill.This is a really special place with tons of history in the heart of the Village. A great place  for a late lunch on a lazy afternoon."
3647,Got the lasagna flights and they were absolutely amazing! Really good selection of drinks and the service was awesome! Would definitely recommend!!
3648,Great pizza/Italian restaurant! Price is totally reasonable for a popular place in Greenwich and the pizza is phenomenal. Can't go wrong with the margarita pizza and they have a TON of cocktails for a great price.
3649,"This is a charming Italian restaurant right off Washington Square Park. It's a hidden gem. The interior of the restaurant is small, cute, and quaint. We were lead to the ""garden"" room to eat. It was a sunroom in the midst of ivy covered buildings with cute fixtures. It felt like a secret garden. The specialty is different types of lasagnas and we enjoyed different kinds. I had the Pesto Lasagna and it was delicious!"
3650,"First, the food was good. Now onto the rest... I booked this place for our anniversary as I wanted something quaint and romantic. Which, the outside area with the lanterns was just that. But, everything else was a miss.The entryway to the restaurant in order to get to the garden area is very cluttered with both things and people. A man, I'm guessing the owner, was sweeping the dining room floor while we were being escorted to our table and instead of stopping while we walked continued and literally swept my foot with no apology. We sat, server seemed over it, not rude, but not welcoming. We ordered a salad to start following our mains. The tables are tiny. So we received our salad, and no less than 3 minutes later our entrees arrived. Instead of the server realizing we weren't close to done with our salad; my spouse, myself and I shimmied around the table to try and make everything fit. My spouses pizza was dangling on the table. We didn't want to stay for dessert to be honest. So after paying the bill, we waited about 10 minutes for the remainder of our pizza we asked to go (which they wrapped in aluminum foil, what?), when I went to ask the server where the to go food was I realized he was in his phone with his headphones in, I'm guessing on a call. His response was ""yeah I'll go grab it now""As far as authentic Italian food? I'd pass. The food was good but there are so many other Italian places that literally feel like you're dining there. The romance level could be there but was severely effected by the staff and owner demeanor."
3651,amazing cute little place hidden away in soho. it is really a gem and im glad i bumped into it.
3652,Saw the photos of the outdoor seating area of this restaurant and I knew I had to pay it a visit. It's not quite as magical during the day but it's still a quaint little lunch spot. I visited with a friend on a Thursday around noon before the pandemic. The place was very empty so there was no wait at all. The restaurant had an amazing deal with several items available for just $7.77 (to celebrate the anniversary of their opening on 7/1977)!My friend I got the following items for just around $25:1) Bruschetta: An absolutely amazing bruschetta. Really crisp bread topped with sweet and tangy tomatoes. Everything I'm looking for in a bruschetta (5/5)2) Margherita Pizza: My friend's entree. A softer base but a nicely bouncy airy and browned crust. No complaints (4/5)3) Pesto Lasagna: Love the browning of the cheese at the top and the general texture but I think I just prefer a regular lasagna. The ricotta and pesto just have a very muted flavor and I was looking for something to brighten it up. (3.5/5)The portions were substantial and the food was all very prepared. I left very happy with the entire experience. I'm so glad I got to visit this spot when they were offering such a fantastic deal. I hope I get to come back for dinner some day.
3653,"A gem in West Village!  We discovered La Lanterna last year in December and have gone there 6 times already:-)From the host Vittorio to other staff members like Tamer everyone is super welcoming. The food at La Lanterna is beyond special; from their bruschetta to lasagna to the best tiramisu in the world, every single dish is exquisite!!Their lasagna bolognese, roasted pepper bruschetta, and tiramisu are a must have!!! If someone ends up going on a super cold day do not forget to order a cup of hot chocolate . It was so good that we had back-to-back three cups of itIt is truly a hidden gem!!!!"
3654,"Favorite restaurant in NYC. Was in disbelief a place exists that is so outstanding in every respect: phenomenally curated menu, outstanding quality with everything I've tried on the menu, such a unique/beautiful atmosphere, great service, seemingly impossibly reasonable pricing, all while in a prime location. Fitting environment whether it's a special occasion or you're stopping by for a bite after the gym. It really doesn't miss. Must try when in the area!!"
3655,"Oh. My. Lanta.You only need two items from here.Pesto lasagna.&Pizza Con Cipolla E Caprino.I'm serious. I don't need to explain what it is, but I am telling you, you will not be disappointed."
3656,"Great place to have a good thin pizza with wine, great ambiance and the best indoor garden in downtown.Great prices and good service"
3657,"We made a reservation for 4 people. Unfortunately one of my friends didn't make it. When we checked in, we were greeted by the host. I asked if she can give us a table at the courtyard, she hesitated to comply with my request but pretended to check if there's any space available. Then she came back and said she can't give us the table at the courtyard because there's only 3 of us. She can only seat 4 people or more based on the booking as requested. Whatever the hell she said didn't make sense. They have tables available and we are the only customers that she seated along the side walk in this freaking hot day. The tiny little set up was super hot and it feels like hell. She kept closing the door as I told her to leave it open we are sweating and suffocating. She couldn't careless and ignored my request.My friends and I left we couldn't stand her freaking nasty attitude and negligence to our needs. It's a no brainer. She needs to be train properly, even just a little bit of a common sense and kindness goes a long way, unfortunately she's lacking on both qualities. She sucks."
3658,"One of the most instagrammable places, good kitchen (food is solid) but rude and greedy owner. The cleanliness is questionable, lots of hairs and dust on all cutlery. Wouldn't go back."
3659,"Very torn about this place although the rip is a tear for certain. This would be my third visit to this place after high recommendation of great authentic Italian cuisine. The second visit caused me to tell the manager, as good as the food is the service makes you wish it would be as good for take out. Enough said on that experience, this let experience, I was seated in the back, check on only when I put in my order got my food and check. Ordered a salad only to receive it when I paid my bill after dessert , and still asked if I wanted it after admitting there fault. The sad part is the food is pretty good here, the lasagna flights are epic, pizza is distinct but service by far is Old school Italian New Yorker. Won't be visiting ever again."
3660,"Only went for dessert. The cappuccino was great. What you would hope to get in a cafe in the village. The desserts were good, too. Nothing to rave about. But good. If you're looking for good coffe/cappuccino type drinks, they have it here. Cappuccino was basically perfect, even if on the small side. I saw lots of people ordering the small pizzas. They smelled good, but we didn't try them, since we already ate somewhere else."
3661,"I would give zero stars if I could. We went here for my friend's birthday and had a large party of people there. Upon reviewing the receipt, we realized we got charged for 6 extra drinks, amounting to being overcharged by about $100 dollars. When my friend called the manager to discuss this, he adopted a very rude tone with her and told her that we were mistaken, they had charged us correctly, and then essentially hung up on her. Serves as a good reminder to check the receipt more carefully upon receiving it, but it was difficult with such a large party.Food was not nearly good enough to warrant this mistreatment and overcharging."
3662,"I went with a friend and it was lovely. The atmosphere is super intimate and would be great for a date. We got the bruschetta, the lasagna flight, and a pizza. All of it was so delicious and pretty reasonably priced. I think next time I'll choose just one kind of lasagna but the flight is good to get for your first time coming here. I highly recommend it!"
3663,"So I said I didn't want to get pizza this night but my friends and I decided this is where we're going to eat. We ordered a bunch of items and shared. O. M. G. This pizza is AMAZING. The atmosphere was great, service was amazing, and food was unbelievable. There was lots of outdoor dining, all tables were far enough apart, and all staff had masks. I definitely recommend if you're ever in the area."
3664,"1. We were impressed by the very cute outdoor seating arrangement they had. Small huts made of plexiglass with heaters that could seat 4 in each. 2. The food was amazing! We loved the pizza and pesto lasagna that w head ordered. For drinks, we got he mulled wine and the Irish hot coffee; the coffee was the side shot winner. The tiramisu was nice too! Overall, I will give 5 stars for the food, hospitality, and ambience combined!"
3665,The food here was amazing. I ordered the meat lasagna flights and the the Arabbiatta pizza which I will be going back for. The tiramisu and coffee were also VERY good.  The menu is a bit long and hard to read especially since the ambiance is dark but the food makes up for it. Would go back.
3666,"Had family in town and brought them to this awesome gem! Ambience, food, and service were excellent. Highly recommend lasagna bolognese and espresso martini (best in the city!). Last but not least, the staff was incredibly accommodating in advance with our reservation as our plans kept changing. Thank you again Sarai!"
3667,Best lasagna EVER! Also the sweet potato soup!!!! It's so good I get it every time I go. The staff is super friendly as well!
3668,Freshly made lasagne. It was delicious and worth the wait. The outdoor/Garden dining area was very nice as well.
3669,"I've walked by here many times and have always wanted to try it out especially with the cute outdoor setup. I finally got a chance when my gf and I decided to brunch. We knew it'd be freezing so we decided to come here. We arrived for our reservation and was promptly seated. Thought the little igloos weren't heated, we got a portable gas heater to warm up the space. Everything started off great but then kinda went downhill from here. First we found out they didn't have any brunch foods. Yes I should've checked out the menu ahead of time but it's hard to believe they wouldn't have some sort of egg dish. Ok we decided to try out the cheese and prosciutto platter with pita chips, soup, and lasagna. The pita chips were delicious and honestly the highlight of the meal. The cheese was good but strangely presented as cubes like from a grocery store. My lasagna was good but definitely not stellar either. Other issues we encountered were the heater kept going out like 5-6 times during the course of our meal. Every time it went out, we'd have to open the door to let out the strong smell of gas!!! Instead of replacing the heater, they'd keep giving us back the same one claiming it was fixed and of course, 5 minutes later it would go out again. The second issue was we ordered champagne and Prosecco and each time, there was a glass that seemed bubbly and another that was completely flat, like the end of an older bottle was used. Sigh. At some point, our server stopped checking on us so we had to flag others down with the heater issue and lack of bubbliness. I know restaurants are having a hard time but honestly, we just wanted a working heat lamp like everyone else and a non flat glass of bubbly, not too much to ask for. At one point, my friend did get a new glass and he graciously topped off mine for free but at this point, it was already the third flat glass. I left with my feet frozen since the last part of our meal was basically without a heat lamp and having to leave the door open so we wouldn't die from the gas smell."
3670,15/10 SO GOOD!! The tortillas are made to order in store on the grill. They even have a glass window set up so people can view the tortilla making yummiess come to life. Their fish taco might be the BEST I've ever tried! When I last came to nyc 3 to 4 years ago I stumbled on this spot and I have been dreaming about this fish taco ever since. The fish itself is so crispy and light all while not being too oily. All the sauces are perfectly strewn on so everybite is spicy and seasoned. Not to mention the tortilla is also amazing! We also tried the spicy shrimp taco which did have a different flavor profile than the fish taco. The shrimp one having a milder taste but very yummy nonetheless. :)) Would recommend this spot with my WHOLE chest!! Come and try a fish taco you will NOT be disappointed.
3671,"The best fish tacos of New York! The vibe is amazing, the staff is helpful and the food is incredibly good and cheap. Tacos a rather small, I usually order 3. Definitely a must if you are in New York and like tacos. This place is very popular, so you need to look for a seating in advance of ordering, as food comes fast."
3672,I miss this place so much. Every time I go I get the agua chiles (verde). Hits the spot every time.
3673,*4.5-5/5Seafood tacos were bomb! Reasonably priced for Chelsea Market. Takes a minute to make but that's why they got soccer playing on the TV. Don't underestimate the hot sauces -- they're actually hot. Two tacos were quite filling. Would come again
3674,"I didn't realize that Los Moriscos and Los Tacos No. 1 we're similar until recently just more emphasis on seafood here! Tried all of the tacos, my favorite one was the fish tacos. The spicy shrimp personally was lacking some flavor, but still good. Add the cucumber mint drink as a refresher to your meal! Overall, a solid experience."
3675,"This is why you're coming here: superb fish tacos. Sure, the ceviche especial - which includes shrimp, clams, scallops and octopus - is good (although not much, considering that it can fit on one tostada) and the guacamole is legit. But you really want to come here for the fish tacos: fresh, soft, crunchy, simple yet delicious. Some have more fish than others (one of those I got had a piece of fish half the size of the other one), but they're all perfectly prepared. My 3-year-old daughter loved them (get them completely plain fir your young kids). Make sure they are on top of your order... We were the only ones there (made sure to drop by at 11a opening time to avoid crowds), but waited 20 minutes for the tacos (really) and had to remind them about the ceviche because they forgot. Other than this, the place is solid. Get here early... not a lot of seats available. The main entrance is on 15 Street, and I recommend it or you'll have to really find it through the Chelsea Market, as it's hidden behind abs below Los Tacos. Many people line up here thinking they're lining up for Los Mariscos, too..."
3676,I have already had tacos here three times in two days.'so you can understand it's tasty. I think spicy shrimp taco is the best. Fish tacos were great too. Seating is quite low but obviously you can sit outside in Chelsea market seating but they were hardly cleaned.Also it's good they asked for proof of vaccination if you want to sit inside but I saw people ordered for to go but still sat inside and ate. So I don't know why they r checking proof of vaccination if they won't make sure that only those vaccinated are seating inside.
3677,"Get delicious fish tacos for a great price here! They were piping hot when I got them. Delicious toppings too. I highly recommend when you're visiting Chelsea Market. During covid there is outdoor seating conveniently outside of Los Mariscos. There's also a bathroom in here. If you choose to dine in, there are a few tables to sit at indoors. There's also a bar area too if you want drinks."
3678,"Overrated--period. Crowds; very limited indoor seating; totally unremarkable food and drinks, as well as service. I really don't get what all the hype is about. I happened to come in around 4 on a Saturday because it came up as a top-rated Yelp recommendation for 'happy hour'. Warning: there are NO happy hour specials here. Food is cheap, but you get what you pay for (including TINY portions of ceviche). Very basic Margaritas were $12. Would not return and would not recommend."
3679,"don't know what ""mariscos"" means? go directly back to Spanish 101 or jump in the ocean...it means seafood, and the small bites of sea here do not disappoint. the laidback fishing-themed lunchroom interior is perfect for enjoying a delicious variety of tacos. located in the Chelsea Market, there are seating options inside and even more outside. there's also a small bar inside that serves adult beverages. if you are food touring through Chelsea Market, this is a must-try. because this is a sister restaurant of Los Tacos No. 1, *spoiler alert* the tacos are going to be point. enjoy Mexican comfort foods that are both comforting and flavorful without being insanely heavy. the fish tacos are amazing. good size. fresh ingredients-- the veggies of the slaw taste so clean. layers of flavor from herbs, spices, and sauce. the crispy bliss of fried fish. the overall impression--this is damn fine taco. pair this with chips and guacamole and you have a satisfying light lunch. Los Mariscos also serves two types of shrimp tacos as well as ceviches. you can sip on micheladas, coronitas, margaritas and a bunch of soft drinks like Mexican sodas.  fish tacos $3.95 + tax + tip. guacamole n chips is $4.95 + tax + tip. adult beverages run between $4ish - $13ish. the staff work hard and are friendly. the fact that the interior and exterior tables are kept so clean despite the insane amount of foot traffic in and around the Chelsea Market is a testament to the sweat that the folks here put in...tip them. drops mic cuz don't taco with ur mouth full  i outzzz"
3680,"solid Valentine's day experience with beautiful decor and decently quick service for how crowded it was the chocolate martinis are a must have - we tried the raspberry and the strawberry and i preferred the raspberry the starters were awesome, burrata salad was so fresh with tons of fruit and the tuna was good too. i enjoyed the pork more than the salmon and the desserts were just okay - the crème brûlée did not have a crispy top and came out more like a slice of cream pie"
3681,"Definitely a must-visit if you're ever in New York!The food was not only plated beautifully, it came with matching flavor. Our favorite dish was definitely the Angry Chicken Lollipops, as is most others apparently. My dinner mates said that the chocolate martini's were also a MUST-TRY. The service was fast, great and we had a great time socializing prior to visiting some other bars. This is a pretty popular spot so it would be valuable to make a reservation ahead of time."
3682,"I always passed by this place and was finally able to try it today for brunch. We sat outside in the trolley which was a cool experience, but still very cold even though it was heated. I really liked the contactless ordering system, where you just conveniently order online and the server brings the food to your table. The only downside was that many things were sold out when we came at 1:30 pm. I ordered Raspberry Mimosa and my friend ordered Hazelnut Chocolate Martini which came with a chocolate truffle on the side. My mimosa was amazing and crafted to perfection. We shared Fig Burrata and Steak & Eggs. Both were excellent. My only small criticism is that I just wished they didn't use a butterknife and also used a bigger plate for the fig burrata. For dessert, we shared twenty-layer crepes cake brulee and this was amazingly good and not overwhelmingly sweet. Prices are definitely steep as our meal came out to be $110 after tax + tip. However, this place is perfect for brunch and is also a cute date spot! I will definitely return to try their other dishes."
3683,"Came here with a friend for happy hour. They have some cool outdoor seating but we opted for inside by a window. The manager sat us and they have a coat rack for hanging up your coats and then they have a cool system where you order everything online and pay online so that you minimize your interaction with actual people. Ordered a chocolate martini for happy hour ($10) and it came with a lovely chocolate truffle. Both drink and truffle were delicious and such a good price. Unfortunately, that is all I had time for, but service, drink and small bite was delicious. The online system is a breeze and makes sure that you get what you want, when you want it. Overall, pretty good place and would definitely come back for another happy hour!"
3684,"Came here on a Saturday night after Korean BBQ around the corner, and it is my new favorite bar in the area! We were seated quickly and could order via our phone, which was a seamless experience and made service faster.I am a huge chocolate fan so I got the chocolate martini, my friends are not so they got a sangria and a lychee martini which they both enjoyed. The chocolate martini also came with a small chocolate piece that was delicious. I loved the chocolate martini, and would love to go back again to try some of their variations, like the strawberry chocolate martini. I saw some other tables order chocolate fondue as well. Will definitely be coming back!"
3685,"I have a group of friends that I call my ""Round Table Crew"" (RTC). We often rotate the choice of meet-up spot. When it came around to my turn, I pulled Ayza off of my list of ""Want To Go"" places. The visit began in great fashion. The manager/host had read the comments I wrote regarding COVID safety in my reservation and addressed my concerns upon my arrival. He gave me multiple seating options and I of course chose the safest (excellent start!). I was asked to wait at the bar while the rest of my party arrived. Some of my RTC crew are often late so while I waited, I got a chance to sample some of the drinks beforehand. They have a HUGE menu of dessert/chocolate cocktails. I'm glad I got there early because it took several minutes to study the drink menu alone. My first drink was the Lychee Berry Martini. I highly recommend it!When the rest of the RTC arrived, we ordered several appetizers to get a little variety and keep things feeling casual.  Our order included the Hot Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Angry Chicken Lollipops, Three Cheese Platter and Crispy Baby Shrimp Dumplings. The squad ordered a slew of drinks, several of which I tried but I can't remember all of them. I finished dinner with a Strawberry Chocolate Martini. Overall I thought this place was fantastic. I'd recommend it as a good date spot. My group was comfortable but the restaurant itself isn't that big, so certain seating areas can feel a little ... ""cozy."" If you're wondering why I reserved a star, it's because when I asked one of the servers regarding a Yelp perk that popped when I checked in on the app, I was basically ignored. I was told that someone would ask the manager about it but no one ever returned for an update. I wasn't going to press the issue. Bottom line: Go! It's really good. If you're anxious about COVID-19 there is outdoor seating. You should also make note of it in your reservation. They will try to accommodate you. It's just too bad that they don't honor Yelp check-in deals."
3686,This place is an absolute Date Night Goals joint! I always wanted to check it out since I worked around the area & finally got to! This is such a cute date spot in midtown that has you covered from start to finish. They have both outdoor & indoor seating. They are also known for they trolly dining space. Their menu is filled with unique delicious dishes & ending the night with their fondue couldn't be any more perfect.  Warning: The chocolate martinis are addicting. My favorite was the raspberry chocolate martini which is surprising since I don't like raspberry fruit..i tried:~Roasted Organic Lamb Chops~Honey Comb Burrata ~Wagyu Burger~Angry Chicken Lollipop ~Goat Cheese Brûlée~Raspberry Martini~Strawberry MartiniAll the food looked incredible with the presentation & tasted amazing. My favorite was the Buratta & angry chicken lollipops. Great spot!
3687,"Excellent wait staff! All were informative and helpful. One was particularly helpful and recommended me the margherita grilled cheese and chenin Blanc, as well as the chocolate earthquake! All excellent recommendations! This is a Chocolate lovers delight or those who appreciate a good drink with a light meal to snack at. I came for lunch and stayed the whole time. No one rushed me and the service was quick and friendly. Everything was delightful but for those who appreciate a more sweet and salty dish the Prosciutto di Parma Ciabatta was a delight in your mouth. The gig jam and prosciutto and mozzarella complimented each other perfectly while the portion was light enough to encourage you to taste more but not so light that you felt cheated. I can't wait to come back and try a few dishes that were not available at the time that I came in. I tried nearly all of their dark chocolates and the espresso was my favorite! A little kick in each nibble. Wonderful intimate dinner indoors or a lighthearted brunch in the patio!"
3688,"Came for a friend's birthday and the service, drink and food were top notch! We sat in the outdoor covered area and it was heated but still a little chilly so be prepared.Standouts we're the chocolate raspberry martini, white truffle pizza, the dip/spreads and charcuterie board. The martini was so decadent it could pretty much be dessert. It drank really smooth and the chocolate shavings and dried raspberry on top just put it on another level. The truffle pizza had plenty of cheese on it and the truffle flavor wasnt overwhelming. The charcuterie board had a wide range of meat and cheeses but also fruit and jam. It was fun to pair a bunch of different things.Service was so friendly. Our water glasses were always filled and drinks and food came out at a good pace."
3689,"I took my mom here for a valentine's day late brunch. This is a cute place, the ambiance and staff are great. I really like the contactless ordering system. The food was good. The  artichoke dip and Angry Chicken Lollipops were the best. We also really enjoyed the Chocolate Earthquake Cake. So decadent!"
3690,Worth it? YesRepeat? YesGreat spot for a date inside the trolley. 4 people max per table inside there. Outdoor seating that is enclosed was very spacious and heated well. Decorations are pretty and the drinks were delicious.We got in at closing time and the manager was gracious enough to order desserts and drinks.Thank you for the hospitality! Can't wait to come back and try the food++Chocolate Martini
3691,"Very cute bar, just a little off from ktown. Checking in gets you a free sangria:)Came for the Happy Hour chocolate martini which didn't disappoint! My friend was skeptical of the chocolate flakes on the top, but once he tried it was obsessed. The drink is already good, but the chocolate flakes really elevate the drink and make it a lot smoother. The drink isn't particularly strong and reminds me of a mildly alcoholic chocolate milk. We also tried the melon mule, which was a bit of a disappointment. Of the HH cocktails, would recommend the chocolate martini first then the sangria."
3692,"The food was very good but the kitchen was extremely, extremely slow. The girl that took care of us was very nice and polite. We went Valentine's Day and it was very busy. Also if you go during the winter dress warm as it's cold and you would probably have to wear your jacket. Overall not a bad experience just really hated the wait."
3693,If you've been thinking about coming to Ayza... DO IT! The wine selection fantastic and the ambience was gorgeous. We got a bottle of Stone Mason & it's my new favorite now. The decor was gorgeous ! The only downfall of this place was ordering on an app but when we requested to order with a waitress we were accommodated with no problem. Definitely will be returning soon!
3694,"Took me ten years to have a Valentine on Valentine's Day. My Valentine's Day usually marked the end of my freedom because work gets busy shortly afterwards and I usually end up buying myself fancy chocolates or discounted chocolate at Duane Reade the next day. My guy made last night extra special because he knew I spent Valentine's Day alone all these years. He picked this spot after lots of R&D because it had chocolate and I have been craving chocolate like no other the past month. So the plan wasn't to eat here because my guy was planning on cooking me dinner. The plan was to have some chocolate and drinks, but when I took a look at the menu and pictures on yelp, I wasn't really feeling the chocolate and wine pairing. What I was feeling was the cocktails. The curiosity killed the cat cocktail is a lavender and vodka moment, which is so my speed, and it was delicious. I had three...well, two. Think my guy wanted to slow me down without telling me to slow down. We did ask them to reduce the lavender syrup by 50% so the drink wasn't so aggressively sweet. Something interesting about this place that I want to note is that orders are made via phone. The staff does bring you your order, but the initial order is made via the phone. It wasn't all that a big deal because they do have a section for special requests and they follow up in person if they have questions, but my guy did have a point when he said he was hoping to get the server's thoughts, opinions, and suggestions on the menu before we ordered, which was not a thing because we order through our phones. If I were to have one complaint, there's only one bathroom stall. That and an hour fifteen min limit per table, which they don't aggressively enforce, but the fact they have that tells me that this place is a come for a good time, not a long time. Not mad about it, but something I noticed. This place is a hidden gem in the area. It is so cozy, cute, and cocktails are just A1. They bring you a small sake glass of mulled wine when you sit down. I am not a sweet drink person, but it was a nice one. My guy came later and the place was getting busy so he didn't get his complementary glass of mulled wine, but it was fine. He finished my drink and enjoyed it way more than I did. Overall, I recommend this place. I do suggest using the restroom before going here because there is always a line of people waiting. I had to beg the guy before me to let me go ahead of him because I was waiting to go to the bathroom for an hour. I had to use the restroom when I got there, had three drinks and sat there for an hour. I had a big problem. Thank goodness the guy was so chivalrous."
3695,Made a reservation here because who doesn't love wine and chocolate?! We were sat right away and they have the best online ordering system i've experienced yet. You order on your phone throughout your dinner and the server brings your stuff shortly after. Their appetizers are great and they have a nice wine selection with the option to sample a bundle! Their desserts are obviously delicious if you have  sweet tooth but would definitely come back here again!
3696,"Came here for a date night on Thursday and it was pretty packed. We managed to get seated in the trolley outside without a wait and with no reservation. It was cozy and very toasty in there. You order and pay through the Toast app. So it's all digital. The server will bring your food to you. There's lots of options for bottles of wine and glasses of wine. A good range of prices. Chocolate martinis are $17 each. We got the Classic chocolate martini - delicious and with real chocolate shavings; also comes with a chocolate truffle, which is does-abs-gone-to-heaven good. This is a must get! Charcuterie board (pick 5 for $38): duck liver pâté, prosciutto, manchego, toma crayeuse, bucheron - they put mustard on the duck liver pâté which completely overpowered the pâté (I had to carefully scrape it all off)- Bucheron is a goat's milk cheese. And honestly it's just like a goat cheese you'd buy at the supermarket. - Manchego is as expected. Just like any other manchego I've had. - Toma Crayeuse is a cows milk cheese. It's funky. Earthy and mushroomy. My favorite. I love complex cheeses and this is a good one. -bread that comes with it is very very thinly sliced and a tad too toasted. Doesn't taste like fresh house made bread. We also ordered nine pieces of assorted chocolate. Some are definitely better than others. All the dark chocolate ones were good. All in all, it was a good time and a good night. Nice ambiance. Nice service. And who can say wine and chocolate doesn't make for a romantic night out."
3697,"Writing an updated review as my boyfriend and I had a fantastic time here last night.We had our first date here and decided to return to this bar to celebrate our first anniversary! Our server Jasmine made our night especially special - she gave us mulled wine and sparkling wine to celebrate the night. We also got to sit inside the trolley, which had an amazing view of the bar's outdoor space. Everything felt super magical after a sip of the chocolate martini! Again, hands down, one of the best happy hours in town (but an extension to 7 pm would make it even better!!)"
3698,"I had a better experience after speaking to Emmy and I really appreciate that she took the time to rectify the situation. I came in with a friend and ordered some light fare with a couple of drinks and really had a better time. The trolley was a lot more mellow than the last time. It was packed before. We received mulled wine this time which was good and my friend and I mentioned how it reminded us of sorrel. The drinks were stronger this time and I had time to actually eat something. We had the lollipop chicken which wasn't bad. The flavor was great and sweet, spicy & salty is usually how I prefer my wings. The avocado fries were very different. I loved the dipping sauces. I enjoyed the chicken tacos the most. That pico was so fresh. We wanted to try the shrimp dumplings but they weren't available on the website for ordering. My friend had the lychee martini and I loved it. I'm normally not a fan of lychee martinis and I feel so alone in this space lol. I enjoy the raspberry that they pair it with. It was very refreshing and made it more tropical. Definitely something I'd order after I get over those strawberry chocolate martinis."
3699,"I went here for my birthday on 1/23/22. Staff: The staff were absolutely amazing! I'd give 10 stars if I could just for them. They were beyond accommodating when I complained I was cold (it was only me. I just tend to be colder than most). They were super attentive, so friendly, truly unforgettable. Even though you don't actually have a waiter you would never notice because of how awesome the staff was. Seating: Both the trolley and the patio were warm enough for a cold winter night. I chose the patio as it was warmer than the trolley. Drinks: I got a nonalcoholic drink can't remember the name but it had lavender in it. It was super refreshing and tasty. My date got the almond and chocolate martini and said that it was really good and strong so big plus there. Food: We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip it came with flatbread 3/5. Shrimp dumplings 4.5/5. Lamb chops 5/5. Wagyu burger 5/5. The fish I believe it was branzino (can't remember) but 5/5. And the chocolate earthquake cake 5/5. Parking: easy to find on the same block especially on a Sunday. Overall a spectacular experience! I would definitely recommend to others and I would revisit."
3700,"Had reservations for Valentine's Day, they decorated the table with rose petals and even gave us some complimentary wine samples as well as two free chocolate shots and chocolate covered strawberries for dessert. We ordered a variety of dishes and everything was so delicious. Next time I'm in nyc I'll be sure to stop by."
3701,"I've been to Ayza numerous times and it is the perfect girl's night out, happy hour, and date night. There's something on the menu for everyone. Upon arriving, you are given a sample of hot mulled wine (which was delicious!!) During the warmer months, you are given a sample of their sangria. Their guacamole is delicious, fresh, and comes with bits of pomegranate (which actually gives it a special flavor) You actually order via a QR code but I noticed this time some of my usual alcoholic orders were sold out. Since they didn't have the Melon Mule, I opted for Taste of Your Own Medicine and my fiancée ordered the Espresso Chocolate Martini. Both drinks were amazing and the espresso martini came with a piece of truffle."
3702,"Ayza  is one of those places that in my opinion can never disappoint.   Ayza has a little something for everyone on the menu - Including an amazing cocktail and wine menu and for those yelpers who love brunch stop by on Sat/Sun.Management and staff are attentive to patrients.  They come over to give updates on your order, they come out to ask questions to makes sure your meal is prepared to perfection.  Most importantly!  In my opinion, out door dining with Heat Lamps it has been this way for a long time.  The lovely  garden wall always transfers my mind to relax mode (This may be helpful for creative people, or those who need to turn off a busy day).No need to wait for a server - sit down scan the table QRCode and right in the palm of your hand is everything you need to get started - make your selection and click to place order.My menu favs are the:- Almond Chocolate Martin- Chocolate Wine- Advovado Fries- Crispy Baby Shrimp Dumblings- Vegan Burger Other Table favs are the :- Black Sea Bass- New Zealand Roasted Organic Lamb Chops- Anjou Pear Salad- Tropical Sangria"
3703,"It was a great service. Amazing food as always and Sauvignon blac was great, choices of 4 wine was amazing. The cheese plater was a great pick. Love their food and wine. Got avocado fries and ahi tuna tartare againThe place was packed but their service was fast and clean. Will be back soon, thank you."
3704,Beautiful wine bar with amazing selection of cocktails including a delicious halzenut chocolate martin and berry martini
3705,"Great food, ambience, vibe and music! Went there with a group of friends for brunch. It was a hot day to be outdoors but it was still worth it. We ordered tons of food and drinks! We wanted to try from the appetizer menu and the chef was nice enough to accommodate that. We ordered the shrimp dumplings, chicken wings, grilles cheese, avocado toast (I would skip this as we get way better ones anywhere else in NYC), spinach artichoke dip, side of roasted potatoes, avocado fries - must try! One of my fav dish was the burrata and the french toast! Don't miss those if you plan to go for brunch. The drinks were good and not too strong. The margarita  looked pretty but tasted ok! I always fancy a good Margarita so I maybe a bit too picky :) Bloody mary lovers - this is a good place to get drunk."
3706,"Ayza is a great spot for a girls night out or a cute date.  The decor is nice enough to feel out of the ordinary, but not so fancy that it feels stuck up.  The same can be said about the wines, chocolates, and service.  As of July 2021, ordering and payment are still contactless.  You scan a QR code and order from your phone.  The only annoying thing is that you have to pay in advance of each order, so if you're ordering multiple rounds of wine, expect to be entering your CC info each time.  Because of the contactless ordering, you don't really get to speak to the waitstaff about wine recommendations, which I feel like is always half the fun at a wine bar.  Oh well.We started with chocolate martinis, strawberry ($17) and raspberry ($18), each of which came with a small chocolate truffle.  Both were tasty and looked cool for a picture, but not quite worth the price tag.  We then tried the Dark Magic wine + chocolate pairing ($43), which came with 4 tasting size glasses of wine and 5 pieces of chocolate and 2 pieces of some sort of peanut brittle; everything was delicious.  This was definitely more fun and unique than the martinis."
3707,"Been wanting to check out this place for a long time. Made a reservation for 6:30pm for Monday night. The place filled up by 7:30, so make reservations! All tables were taken. Seating is limited to small groups, so this is not for large parties. Perfect ambiance for a romantic date or a dinner to impress. The chill yet trendy vibes make this a great place for photos. Service is courteous and swift. The only odd thing is that you have to order food and pay at the counter, so the only interaction you have with your waiter is when your food is delivered and cleared.Alcohol and food prices are high: a chocolate almond martini is $17. It was strong and well balanced. The drink was delicious--sprinkled with dark chocolate shavings and slices of almond. Plus, it came with a chocolate truffle on the side--to indulge your sweet tooth in addition to your alcohol affliction. We got $15 white truffle pizza, a $28 mezze platter, and a $38 cheese & meats assorted platter to share. Everything was delicious and fresh. This was a splurge, but We greatly enjoyed the food and left stuffed and happy. Would gladly return!"
3708,"This place was super close to our hotel, so we stumbled here not wanting to go far. The outdoor atmosphere is welcoming and it was decently busy.The ordering process is a bit interesting. You use your phone to access the menu and then go tell the hostess your order. They'll bring it out to you and when you're done, you go back to the hostess to pay for your order. Almost like a bar tan? LolThe food was surprisingly delicious. We loved the chicken lollipops the most, definitely recommend an order or two!"
3709,"Came here with a date and made a reservation in advance. Was mildly busy but probably less so because of the weather. I imagine it's going to be utterly packed for Valentines day. Even though it was 20F outside, we sat in the trolley with sweaters and it was great. Would prob recommend not being by the door though, as it got cold quickly.Service was top notch, our waiter was really helpful with recommendations (although when he was explaining the wine pairings, it was completely lost on us noobs). I wish they'd label or have pictures of what each wine/chocolate is. We definitely had favorites, but wouldn't know what to get again.Chocolate martini was also great. Would agree with the reviews that recommend it. Don't think you could go wrong with any of the flavors, but I quite liked the almond one.My date paid, so not sure on prices, but I think they looked reasonable for what was offered.Overall would highly recommend for dates. Do the trolly if you can. It's more intimate. Will def be back"
3710,"Great spot for happy hour! This bar was a few blocks away from the hotel I was staying at. It has plenty of outdoor seating, and some indoor seating as well as a trolley that they've converted into a dining area. The drinks were fantastic and I loved their tropical sangria and mules. Appetizers were okay, just small bites, nothing to rave about."
3711,"I loved it so much the first time that I came back again with my friend. We were looking for a place to go for happy hour after work. Unfortunately Ayza's happy hour ends at 6. But, that didn't stop us from enjoying the wonderful wine flights and a bite to eat. I enjoyed the wine sampler of 3:  SANCERREreserve durand, CHARDONNAY -chateau de messey, SHIRAZ & GRENACHE19 crimes. Each glass was better and better. Tuna tartare over avocado. Normally the idea of raw tuna makes me nervous. But this was amazing and well seasoned. So good. Served with plantain chips. Also had the crispy baby shrimp dumplings. They were really good! The garlic chili sauce was wonderful and the Yellow Sea wakame salad was great! Will continue to come here. They are great!"
3712,"I've been meaning to come to Ayza for years now and on a whim my friend and I decided to stop by on a Friday night. Even though the restaurant was very crowded there was either a table or a small greenhouse available at the time. Though the greenhouse was dirty the host graciously arranged for it to be cleaned after a few minutes for us.After we sat down in the greenhouse we got a taste (and smell) of the pros and cons of sitting in that spot. Even though it was nice to be far and separated from others in the restaurant it also appeared to be next to the unofficial smoking area of both the restaurant and the nearby residential building. Therefore, throughout our meal people kept standing next to us and smoking which ended up getting trapped in the greenhouse and kind of ruined part of our meal due to the consistent barrage of smoke. This is of course no fault of the restaurant but definitely something to know about if you are considering sitting in the greenhouse.We decided to each get a martini and share a cheese platter.I got a chocolate strawberry martini which was not that good. The strawberry martini tasted slightly cough syrupy and was hard to stomach. Additionally, it did not come with the strawberry garnish that was presented in its menu picture :( My friend ordered an almond chocolate martini which was much better.As for the cheese platter. Everything on the platter was very fresh; however, one of the cheeses they gave us was wrong. At that point I was too tired to ask them to change it (given that I would need to walk to the front to talk to any of the servers/hosts). The cheeses also came with a basket of bread that ended up not being enough for us even though the cheese platter itself was on the smaller side for the price. We asked for another bread basket which the hostess in front put in; however, after 10-15 minutes without bread I had to go up again and we were given the new basket right away.Service apart from that moment though was good.All in all, a pretty average meal with some hiccups along the way."
3713,"We were craving desserts after dinner at another restaurant so we found Ayza. They had a warm chocolate molten cake on the menu so we rushed over and were lucky to get a table right before their last call. The cake is served with a dulce-de-leche ice-cream. The combination was so delicious, we came back 2 days later. And I think I just found my new favorite ice-cream flavor! Both ladies we spoke to at the front when placing our orders were extremely engaging and friendly. I definitely recommend eating here!"
3714,"Ayza is one of those places where I immediately wanted to come back, as soon as the meal was over! I went here for dinner and was seated outdoors (plenty of outdoor seating, in addition to the famous trolley). You do have to walk up to the front to place your order, but we were told this is temporary. Additionally, the restaurant charges a 3% Covid recovery surcharge, which I haven't seen elsewhere. I truly didn't know what to order because everything on this menu sounds incredible! I started with the dark magic wine flight, which was great and came with six different chocolates. My friends got the peppermint chocolate martini (delicious but not very strong) and the raspberry lychee martini (highly recommend!). We decided to order a bunch of appetizers including the white truffle pizza (my personal favorite), short rib bruschetta, tuna tartare (the quail egg on top is such a cool touch), burrata, and spinach artichoke dip. Other than the spinach artichoke dip (not bad, but not special either), I feel like all of these are must haves! Overall, a really great restaurant if you're looking to share some small plates. I will absolutely be back!"
3715,This place was such a great find! We decided to come here because you get a free sangria or wine when you check in (Woo!!) but we ended up staying here and ordering a second round of drinks because the ambiance and service was great!The outdoor space is decorated super trendy and they have an easy streamlined way of ordering where you just walk up to the hostess whenever you are ready. The sangria was refreshing and filled with a lot of fresh fruit but was not overly sweet. My friend ordered some food as well (ahi tuna tartare) and said that it was delicious too so you cant go wrong there. Come for the free drink but stay for the vibes!
3716,"Lovely happy hour spot with good wine and food to go with it! We ordered this charcuterie board with two cheeses and prosciutto. Extremely delicious and left us craving for more - now we know what to order when we go back! Beautiful interior, though slightly small because go COVID restrictions with separated tables and plexiglass between them. The outdoor setup is also well done, so would definitely love to be seated there next time now that the weather is warming up."
3717,"AMAZING. Just flat out incredible. The food came out quickly, the food was the best quality, the staff was friendly, and the atmosphere was modern/chic. HIGHLYYYYY recommended!"
3718,"Must try: Avocado Fries, Cheese Platter, and Ayza's Signature Cocktails!Why: Honestly, everything we tried was amazing! As appetizers we got the Avocado Fries and Assorted Cheese Platter. The Avocado Fries were deep fried with coated breadcrumbs that made for a crispy bite on the outside and soft inside. The sriracha sauce (not spicy) and ranch sauce were great compliments. The Cheese were recommended by the waitress including French, Italian, and Swiss Cheese with Prosciutto - so much cheesy goodness! I got the La Havana Sandwich, which was cheesy and meaty - yum! Also came with baby pickles and small spring salad with strawberries. Lastly, I had 3 cocktails that were all so dang good: Chocolate Manhattan, Pumpkin Bubble Tea Martini, and Salted Caramel Sazerac.Notes: This is my new fav restaurant! The workers were all super friendly and helpful. They all wore masks and kept areas clean. We got to sit in the super cool trolly, which was a neat experience. The windows were open so fresh air flowed throughout trolly. I can't wait to come back and try other unique and eclectic menu items! Also, next time will try wine and chocolate pairings! Overall, such a wonderful dining experience!"
3719,"Came here for dinner w my sis and we both loved it. Def make reservations if you can as the place can get packed. We decided to eat indoors as the trolley was packed (maybe next time). We had the classic and strawberry martinis which were so delicious and yummy. It reminded me of Bailey's but way better. For appetizers we had the dumplings and angry chicken lollipops. My sis thought the chicken was a little spicy but delicious. My dumplings were great but the sauce def had a kick. For entrees we had the truffle pizza, which we both loved as the portion and taste were delicious. Overall, its a great place for a small gathering of ppl. It can also be great for date night or happy hour. The mulled wine was great too and is given if you either make reservations or check in through Yelp. My only minor issue was using the toast app as our table and name came up under a diff thing. However, our server and manager were able to fix it. Once it did work, its easy to order."
3720,"Came to this place twice for drinks and dessert. It's a cute little place to go to. The place itself is very small inside, but they have added a covered outdoor area and then there is something in the street for people to sit in as well. It looks like a train. The last time I was here, the dessert was amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of it. Everything that comes out always is so presentable. There are no servers to order through. You use your phone to order and pay. Then someone brings it out to your table."
3721,"Loved this place! Came with a friend after dinner and since we each checked in on Yelp, we got a free drink. I got a delicious sangria and she got a glass of wine. She also ended up getting a chocolate espresso martini which was pretty good! We got a lava cake to share..which was a little disappointing since it definitely didn't flow out :( other than that vibes were great, drinks were great. Would defs give some of their other stuff on the menu a shot!"
3722,"The first thing that stood out were the decorations in the outside seating (not on the street but under an overhang) that created a lovely place for pictures. We ordered the peach mascarpone french toast, which was quite large. The french toast itself was cooked well and was moist. The mascarpone was not too sweet but also could be a little more flavourful. Would recommend sharing this with other food as it is quite sweet unless you have a huge sweet tooth. While not pictured, we also ordered the baked truffle potatoes which were topped with Parmesan cheese. They were extra crispy and I would definitely recommend ordering it!"
3723,Beautiful ambiance and great food! Drinks are crafted to perfection Drinks: Antioxidant Margarita Prickly Pear Mezcal MargaritaCuriosity Killed the CatRaspberry MimosaEdit to add desserts Chocolate FondueChocolate Earthquake Cake
3724,I came here with my hubby and we had a blast. We made a reservation which was best. The service was so good. The food was soo awesome' I will definitely come back.
3725,"I have been wanting to come to this place for a few years. I finally set aside time and made a reservation. Funny thing, when I arrived it wasn't the place I passed years ago. I clearly got it confused with another restaurant. However, that was truly a happy accident. I had a wonderful experience and am so glad I came here! Here are the deets...First I must say Samantha (the receptionist) and Jasmine (the waitress) were great. It was a pretty busy night and they provided excellent customer service. There was an event that evening and while that section was beautifully decorated and quite busy, we never felt neglected. And yes, we had to go to the receptionist for our orders but it does mention this on the website and they were very attentive and followed up. They were friendly, professional and informative. There are a few types of outdoor seating... under the awning, the outskirts with no overhead coverage and in the trolley (which has booths, counter space and AC). We sat at the outskirts on the high top tables. We started with chocolate martinis. Often times this drink is either creamy and weak or boozy and watery, somehow this one was rich, creamy, boozy, decadent and had real chocolate shavings on top! Eyes closed on the first sip. MMMMM.This was accompanied by chocolate truffles. Decadent, sweet, creamy chocolate with a hint of salty, savory, nutty flavor that simply melts in your mouth while somehow making it water! Delicious. Unfortunately, they don't sell it by the box (I asked).We had a few glasses of crisp white wine. Then we had a cheese platter. O.M.G. I love a good cheese platter and this was gooooood.Prosciutto, duck liver, parmigiano reggiano, herb goat cheese and manchego. Yum!!! Good sized portions, beautifully presented and fresh ingredients. As we sat and enjoyed the food, ambiance and company, there was this smell that billowed around us. Something so delicious and mouth watering  we had to ask.. It was the crispy baby shrimp dumplings from another table so we ordered them. They had crispy sides, hard and crunchy edges and juicy flavorful filling. Instead of the usual minced center, there were whole, tender shrimp inside each dumpling. It is a fresh, simple, delicious appetizer. My only complaint, I should have started with this and ended with the martinis. Now I know for next time! I will be back."
3726,Amazing cocktails!! The mulled wine is incredible!! Would high recommend for some really fun drinks :). Didn't eat anything but had a great drink experience!!
3727,"I came here for brunch with a party of six with a reservation. We arrived early--around 10:45am and they don't open until 11am but they still let us sit down. Our party was also incomplete and they still let us sit, so that was very nice of them!The drinks were great, especially the chocolate martinis. I had the espresso chocolate martini and I almost felt like I was vibrating afterwards! My mom loved her mint chocolate martini--she said it tasted like a peppermint patty. Every chocolate martini comes with a complimentary chocolate, which made me so happy! The chocolate is so smooth and decadent. I also tried the melon mule and it was really good.My honeycomb fig burrata was okay but too sweet for me to finish. I think it would have been better if it had a sharper cheese sprinkled in--maybe some gorgonzola or goat cheese for a balance of salty and sweet. The service was good--you order and tip through an app. Overall, it was a very nice experience but I wouldn't order the honeycomb fig burrata again."
3728,Great food and atmosphere especially for a date! Very intimate. Would come here a million times over. Covered and open outdoor seating. Service was swift despite crowd. Easy touch-less/mobile ordering and payment system via toast. Don't miss the chance to come here!
3729,"Every thing was very very solid. Food was good service was okay.  Just we had an issue, bc one of our party members has a nut allergy and out waitress was aware. HOWEVER she failed to tell us ALL OF THE SIDE SALADS has nuts in it. Thank God the not allergy was non fatal but we did have to use his epi pen to prevent the swelling.  The manager did apologize and accommodate.  But that waitress kinda shocked me without warning us about the food allergy."
3730,"Drinks and food were yummy. If you get the chance, definitely sit on the trolley - it was such a fun experience! Service was great and super fast! We dined on a Saturday and would definitely go again."
3731,"This place was surprisingly great, my best friend found it and made reservation for my Birthday. We sat at the trolley outside  it a as wonderful, thank God the weader weather was nice. JASMINE was amazing she really made our night she was very attentive. The food portion was small but it was delicious. I will visit again soon, I will try a lunch next time."
3732,"Had the Avocado Fries, Roasted Butternut Squash soup (a special), and the Dark Chocolate Fondue. All great. Not quite enough of the chocolate though for the amount of stuff they give you to dip in it.Soup was tasty, a little spicy, and a little sweet. Vegan, so not creamy but still a good consistency.First time for deep-fried avocado. Now I'll be on the lookout for it."
3733,TLDR: best espresso martinis in NYC! Everything else is a bit pricey and average. Ambiance: Indoor is very loud! Would not recommend for a date spot or if you want to catch up with someone. Good for birthdays and celebrations! The outdoor trolley is sooo cute and aesthetic! It gets chilly in the winter but for fall and spring it is the perfect!!Espresso martinis: THE BEST! So many different flavors! I recommend the raspberry! The mint one tastes too much like an Andes. Don't bother coming here if you don't get an espresso martini!!!Food: burrata is delicious - so fresh! Would recommend getting as a little side snack. HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone who loves espresso martinis!
3734,I ordered the dessert wine tasting with white chocolate which is right up my alley. Ayza Wine & Chocolate Bar also offers bottles of wines as well as a food menu. The ambiance was the main selling point with very aesthetic booths (even during the pandemic) including plant covered walls. I liked that the restaurant really caters to different wine preferences since I was able to order a really sweet Moscato D'Asti that I enjoyed. I would recommend that you give this place a try as an change of pace to all the other places near ktown.
3735,"I used the Check in with Yelp for a free glass of Pinot Gregio and they were very generous with the pour. Huge thumbs up for that. Ordered the Avocado Fries and they were super crunchy. Perfectly coated and fried. My hubby had Butternut Squash soup and almost licked the bowl. Very tasty, and a touch on the sweet side. Not creamy as it was vegan, but with complex flavors that changed from sweet to spicy. We couldn't place what was added to get that flavor. We then had the Chocolate Fondue. Served with lots of strawberries, bananas, and Rice Crispy Treats. (Also has marshmallows on the menu but we opted out of those.) The RCT were very soft and fell apart when trying to dip in the chocolate. They were so generous with the other dippers that we had a few more to nibble after polishing off the chocolate. Great dessert to share. All in all very tasty and a satisfying way to end the meal."
3736,A friend took me here for my birthday! I loved it.  we sat outside in the trolley and that in itself was a cool experience.  Ambience was solid!  The top items here that were memorable was the chocolate martini - which was strong and also the pasta dishes!
3737,"I came back here to give this place another chance, and everything was wonderful. We basically ordered the same plates, but also added in the mushroom flatbread and we loved it! The service was also on point. The hostess frequently checked in and was knowledgeable about the menu. This is a great place to bring a group of friends!"
3738,"It's wine and chocolate. In a garden setting. What more could you ask for?We shared the Dark Magic flight, and I also tacked on a Wild Mushroom Omelette because no one gets full on 6 pieces of chocolate. Yummers all around. Only thing I didn't enjoy was being haunted by a giant bee/wasp-looking creature that was clearly drawn to all the sugar on the outdoor tables. It would not leave us alone. When we mentioned it to the staff, one of them sprayed it with water until it died. That was not a fun sight to behold. RIP giant wasp-bee."
3739,"very cute interior and exterior, lovely service with free hot wine upon arrival. The prices are a bit steep and the quality speaks for it. Chocolate martinis were delicious. Make reservations online. I didnt know the reservations were time boxed so make sure to check. They take cards and very tough parking."
3740,I love this place. Great coffee and pastries. I was visiting the city and this was one of my favorite coffee shops.
3741,We absolutely love this place! We spent a few days in NYC and tried a few coffee shops but we kept coming back to Frisson! The cappuccino is superb! The froth was just the right and the espresso in there is soo good! Excellent coffee around NYC!
3742,Recently moved to the suburbs and have come back to the city to see some shows and whatnot. Happened upon Frisson and was blown away by the amazing espresso. I realized I hadn't had really good espresso in months. Now whenever I come into the city I make a point of coming here. The staff is super kind and the cortado is such a treat!! Love!
3743,"Very nice spot. The iced coffee with oat milk was full of caffeine yet still sweet. Both the butter croissant and almond one were AMAZING. As for my Bfs Latte, he enjoyed it and the design was picture worthy"
3744,"Coffee here stacks up to some of the best places in NYC such as Devocion, Abraco, Happy Bones. Went here twice on my trip to NYC."
3745,"This espresso shop has the best coffee drinks on the entire west side of Manhattan.  Located in Hell's Kitchen, this very small, very cozy spot offers up some of the best lattes in town.  I get mine with oat milk.  The best.Barsitas are always friendly and fast.Highly recommended."
3746,"I walked past this cute little shop a few times, it was calling my name. I was staying on this street, and it became apart of my morning routine. The staff here, WOW! They are so kind, they greet you with such warm energy which is nice for someone who isn't used to the hustle and bustle of Manhattan. The Espresso is on point, and milks steamed to perfection (I used to be a barista so I take the coffee experience very serious lol) They even have actual croissant sandwiches and quiche! Enjoyed a morning read in here. It is very cozy, places to hang your coat, and if your lucky you will get the cute spot by the window! PLENTY of OUTLETS! I came on a Wednesday around 11am and it was only me and anything person. Perfecto! Loved the Music, not too loud or distracting."
3747,"Cute neighborhood coffee shop! I stop by once in a while at this place, and was always greeted by the super friendly barista. The shop has a nice cool vibe, and it also has assorted pastries items along with a comprehensive coffee menu. I ordered a large iced oat latte, and was happy to see they used Oatly (which is my fav) for the milk. The barista is super nice, and remembered my order after my initial visit a few weeks ago. Coffee is really good, but it is slightly pricey. However, definitely a neighborhood gem that I will be consistently visiting."
3748,"Just a short walk from Times Square, this coffee shop in Hell's Kitchen is a gem! In a quiet residential neighborhood, their cappuccino's amazing with a beautiful design and their other items also look and taste delicious and fairly priced. I'd love to try their espresso and pastries some day. Their barista's fun, helpful, and kind of cute!"
3749,"Came by for coffee the other day and it was a tucked-away gem!Ordered a mocha from the friendly cashier and my mocha came out perfect! Perfect temperature, smooth espresso, and chocolate that wasn't too sweet!They have free Wifi and plenty of seating too!"
3750,"Excellent capp.  Mediocre commercial almond croissant.  It won't kill you, but skip it.  Very nice people."
3751,"very nice people working coffee brew is amazing cute interior, i recommend the almond hot latte. comes in mugs and has a cute design on top"
3752,Very no-frills coffee shop. Stopped by for a quick morning coffee run. Coffee is pretty standard but super convenient for what I wanted!
3753,"Best cappuccino in NYC that I've found! And I've looked far/wide. Lovely baristas that make an effort with every beverage. Milk is always perfect microfoam, unlike most coffee shops in the city which overdo the foam time for capps especially. Highly recommend"
3754,"Good coffee but please skip the canele. The canele was old and stodgy. The barista heated it up before putting it in a bag, but the center was still cold and doughy, might have been sitting in the fridge for some time."
3755,Walked by and discovered this hidden gem. The latte was on point and delicious! Will be back again to try other drinks.
3756,my favorite coffee place in hell's kitchen. a small tucked away space with great espresso. super smooth and strong too. i do tend to get hot espresso drinks for their intricate latte art. caps/napkins are across from the door which you can help yourself to
3757,Amazing espresso / always pop over here when I need to be in Times Square office
3758,"delicious coffee and super friendly baristai came for the keto latte, but they phased it out post-pandemic. :( but the coffee i had was solid!"
3759,An amazing barista with amazing coffee. That was the feeling I got from visiting this place once you walk in you smell the scent of coffee and it's amazing and it's not like those cheap ass coffees like Starbucks. would definitely recommend this place to everyone visiting the town
3760,"Super friendly staff and solid drinks.I've had several of the drinks and the almond croissant. The almond croissant is from a local bakery and I personally found it a bit meh - decent flavor, above-average top crust, but nothing particularly memorable. The drinks, however, more than make up for it. Their seating has opened back up, and it seems like more and more people are inside every time I stop by. It's a great place to chat with friends or get your morning reading in. There's also a small two-seater table set up near the door if hanging out outdoors is more your vibe!My !only! complaint is that it sounded like the owner was rooting for the Suns in the NBA finals, though I guess it could be worse if he were backing the Clippers....... I'll allow it I suppose. :p (I.e. service is otherwise impeccable and the dude will fly through orders like no other, have regulars' drinks ready before they reach the front, engage in just enough friendly banter, etc. The dude was *made* for this.)Frisson takes card but cash is preferred, so stop by the ATM if possible. They also have stamp cards, so rack up those visits and enjoy a discount later on!"
3761,"This cozy little coffee shop was amazing. I had a dirty chai and and quiche Lorraine and it was fantastic. The barista, Robert, was so friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back!"
3762,"what a cute local coffee shop with high quality drinks! I highly recommend their classic latte with oat milk. delicious, smooth, and so creamy--can't get better than that! Even better, pair it up with their almond croissants."
3763,What a great find in Hell's Kitchen! Not only are they super friendly but the coffee is great and they let you use your laptop with their wifi.  I didn't realize how many places now ban laptops (can they even do that?).  Stop in! you won't regret it!
3764,"Small shop but very homy feeling. I got a quad espresso shot over ice and they got it to me pretty quickly. It was not bad but seemed cloudy compared to normal. I saw coffee grinds in there which make me think that they didn't pull the shot properly. Overall though, I'd come again."
3765,"Great little spot to stop and get a drink. We got a latte and a chai latte.  Both were delicious.   We also tried a canele which was very tasty, I should have bought more!"
3766,Stopped in here for the first time before heading to work. I was greeted immediately by a friendly man. Ordered a large cappuccino wIth almond milk. The barista said they only have one size and it's small lol. I said that was fine. He made it quickly. It was $4.75 which is a little pricey for the size. But it was delicious! A little bitter at first. The foam was perfect and he made a beautiful design with the almond milk. I only wish it came in a larger size! Haha. I'll be back to try more menu items for sure..
3767,Great coffee!  Great customer service!  Also had a ham and cheese croissant which tasted like the ones from Europe.  If you have a chance stop by here and grab a cup of joe. You won't regret it!
3768,"I don't know the guys name who helped me but he was really nice and greeted me right when I walked in the door, what a great highlight of my day. The iced latte was super good too :) thanks!"
3769,"Incredible...the best coffee I've had in a while. Everything about it was perfect- the temperature, the froth, the sweetness, even presentation. I usually hate the coffee I get here in NY, but this was the most pleasant hands down."
3770,"Outstanding service! Crazy good food! Fantastic location!  Went for Saturday brunch on a girls weekend. We started with the blood orange spritzer. Like spring in a glass. Light and bubbly.  (There is vodka in this, so don't be fooled by the lightness. And so good.)Shared the beignet with lemon curd.  How have I never had lemon curd with beignet before?  Must have this way forever more. Had the poached eggs with greens, grits, and sausage. So delish and flavorful. Perfectly seasoned. Perfectly made poached eggs.Huevos Rancheros - wow, what a dish. If your hungry fry this. The dish went on forever in a good way. So happy we went here. Looking forward to returning."
3771,Highly Recommend 1. Beignets 2. Baked French Toast 3. Scramble 4. Poached Eggs Paired perfectly with a bloody!
3772,"Walked in on a weekday with no reservation. Super friendly staff, great service.Split the huevos Rancheros with one other person- was pretty filling. Was prepared really well and very tastyWould go back!"
3773,This is one of those cozy places that you can never go wrong with. I went here on a date with my boyfriend and we were both blown away with how fresh and tasty the food was. Additionally their service was really good and the waitress offered great recommendations as it was our first time. I would definitely go back with friends or family.
3774,"You can never go wrong with a meal at Cookshop! The service is always great, the food is fresh and the menu is changes seasonally. The interior of the restaurant is warm and inviting and I love the extra space between tables. I've been here for both brunch and dinner and each time it's been a great experience. With that said, the brunch is definitely better than dinner at Cookshop. Brunch is bustling, the plates come out fast and prices are very reasonable! My personal favorite is the French toast. It's truly the best French toast I've ever had, it's creamy and the berries compliment the whole dish perfectly. I love that it comes in a skillet as well. Get some of their thin crispy shoestring fries on the side and you're set! As for brunch drinks, the espresso martini here is 10/10. It's incredibly well made and elegantly presented.Dinner service today seemed a bit more rushed than normal but we still had a great meal. The Pomelito (tequila drink) was delicious - fruit forward and a rich salt rim. The burrata we got to share was excellent - creamy and paired with butternut squash. I got the casarecce pasta which was simple and the walnut Brocolli pesto was one of a kind. Overall I do wish that the dinner portion sizes were a bit larger as we left still feeling a bit hungry.Definitely pay Cookshop a visit if you're in Chelsea, it's a bustling and delicious spot!"
3775,"I've been coming to cookshop for some time, and I stopped coming for some time because of some mishaps, however, today I had the best experience here. It is usually a great spot for weekend brunches and people watching, especially for dog parents. On arrival, the place was packed (not surprising) and we were seated outside, however they had heaters and blankets on each seat, and this made my day to see the effort put into making guests warm and welcome on a cold day.For food, I decided to go a different route from what I'm used to, and I ordered the french toast with sausages and fries. Just wow! The french toast was nothing like I've ever had before, whatever  sauce they put on it, tasted like heaven, creamy, not too sweet with just the right punch. My friend had the scrambled eggs with feta cheese, and that was also a big hit. Christian was our server and he was pretty good. I guess I'll be a regular guest here again."
3776,"Cookshop is consistently wonderful...great food, service and ambience.  The menu is diverse and we find new items popping up all the time.  We've eaten there many, many times and always love it ."
3777,"Outstanding dining experience. Cookshop in Chelsea is an amazing restaurant. They're serving up some divers and innovative dishes including offering vegans some great options which we throughly enjoyed. We dined here in early Sept. with a small group of friends and sat outside in their  roomy parklet area. This area is a great alternative to dining inside, especially if you don't feel comfortable yet during COVID. The food is great here, can't recommend it more highly. We had several vegan options to choose from and honestly felt quite welcomed here. We ordered the shishito peppers, heirloom tomatoes and pesto pasta that they were able to make vegan. Everything was great, fresh, savoy and artfully plated. Great overall experience, one I'd love to revisit.If you're in Chelsea and find yourself at all hungry, go here. You'll be a happy person."
3778,"Surprised I had never heard of this restaurant! Came here last night and started with the burata which was incredible. Then had the pork chop and chicken and both were amazing. Don't sleep on the chicken, very good. Would definitely come back"
3779,"An old favorite, Cookshop is always packed. It has been going strong in Chelsea for well over 20 years. Once cutting edge, it is now just good solid food. You will always have an enjoyable, even if not particularly creative, meal. Their other restaurants - Shuka, Vic's -- are more creative. All very good. Expect a wait if you are going for Sunday brunch."
3780,"Roasted chicken breast salad was exquisite (just the right amount of food) and the lemon, lime & bitters beverage was both beautiful & tasty."
3781,"My bf and I walked by this place and decided to walk in for dinner because of the nice ambience. We were seated outdoors with the pretty lights and greenery. The dinner menu didn't have too many choices which was a good thing since I can be indecisive. We decided to share food since we were going for some pizza around the corner after. Burrata (4/5): Haven't had an appetizer like this before. The burrata was warm and gooey with a leek/chive olive oil drizzle surrounding it. There were pieces of toast on the side to eat it with. It was too hard/toasty for me to bite into, but overall was enjoyable altogether. Swordfish (4/5): I should have know this dish would be small. Definitely not enough to share if you plan to only have dinner here, but in our case we had other plans afterward. The fish was tasty! Each bite was smooth with hints of oregano (?). Cucumber Cooler (5/5): This was quite a refreshing cocktail. Cucumber flavor was definitely there with little to more like no alcohol flavor, which is what I prefer. Definitely recommend!It was a busy night, but our server was attentive. Food is pricey so come ready to enjoy."
3782,"Did not enjoy the mushroom pizza, extremely salty. The salt level overpowers everything else, you cant even taste the mushrooms. Has a very weird taste. Dessert only looks nice, tastes like a cheap chocolate pudding, nothing decadent about it. They def could've done a better job . Felt like a waste of money on both."
3783,"Oh this is my first time to this restaurant, we started with radishes and heirloom tomatoes. They were both great, they should consider doing another dip for the radishes the thick butter wasn't very tasty. The garden salad was super crunchy, the dressing was good... Wish it had a little bit more to it. My husband got a Mexican dish, definitely a good one served in a skillet. Overall, the waiter was fantastic and the food Was extremely fresh and the presentation was perfect. Upping my stars to a 5!"
3784,Came here during the day for lunch on the patio and was impressed! Their cucumber cooler drink was strong and delicious. Great drink on a warm summer day. To eat I had the smoked brisket sandwich and this sandwich was massive! Huge! I had to take some of the brisket out first to eat. It also came with fries so I think for NYC standards this is a good deal and big enough item to share if needed. Others in my party had the fish sandwich and poached artic salad. We were all impressed with our meals and the service was great. Nice outdoor patio as well. Would definitely recommend and be back!
3785,My family and I had Brunch here for 2 days in a row in February of 2022 (Saturday and Sunday). The drinks are excellent and the food is very good plus attentive and fast service. Bust the first thing we have noticed was a very positive vibe of the place. This place is alive!
3786,"An old friend is just like that, good , tasty and consistent. This place is lively and fun with great service. Our waiter tonight was amazing, he was like one of the group!  We started with a pizza with ramps which was great as all the pizzas are. An arugula salad and a gemLettuce salad were also plenty to share amongst the 4 of us. Some fun cocktails to start like a pomelo froze, a spritz and a mezcal margarita. The entrees ranged from the Arctic char salad to the pan roasted cod to chicken a d lamb chops. No food left here! The Arctic char salad was great with fresh peas tasty greens and a delicious light dressing.Cookshop is always one of my favs for so many reasons!"
3787,"Well it doesn't get much better than this. We were in the middle of brunch when everyone started clapping and cheering, horns honking as cars were driving by, what is going on?? Oh Biden won?? What a perfect day! Also the brunch was delicious :DHappy days!"
3788,"4.5 stars for a very solid brunch on the pricey side of the spectrum. Outdoor seating set-up is well designed and socially distanced. Thoughtful little touches like small paper bags for each person's mask, well placed heat lamps, and small portable lights brought to tables (it was daylight and we didn't need it) abound. Service also very attentive.I had the house bloody mary, a decent and not too spicy version of the brunch classic, and a very good huevos rancheros. The huevos rancheros was well conceived and assembled, among the tastier versions I've had at a non-Mexican restaurant, although I could have done with a few less pickled onions on top.Mid-afternoon on an overcast Saturday was bustling and Cookshop is a short block from the Highline so the crowds will always be here. Make a reservation or be prepared to wait for 40 minutes as we did. Fashionable, less diverse, and upscale/older crowd at this time of day. Overall, a strong brunch contender."
3789,"Good brunch spot, one of the few places that take weekend reservations for brunch. I like the outdoor spots, very spacious - the dining experience during COVID felt safe, the menu was through a QR code.Food wise, got the huevos rancheros and the burger. The huevos rancheros was very yummy, the beans were particularly good. I've been to this spot a couple times before and I usually get the grain bowl, which is pretty nutritious and healthy for brunch. Recommend this spot as a casual go to for brunch. Also a good location for exploring downtown after brunch."
3790,"Great brunch spot! We came here on a sunny Saturday in the Fall and they had cute blankets to keep the clients warm draped over every chair. The staff were efficient and quick which was impressive given all the tables inside.  We ordered cocktails which were beautiful - they have a spin on the classic Bloody Mary that is tequila based and has an extra kick of spice! For mains we ordered the egg sandwich with a side of garden salad and the huevos rancheros. Highly recommend for a cute, energetic brunch spot and delicious cocktails!"
3791,"An absolutely highly recommended brunch place. The Benny I had  was amazing and wife had the breakfast sandwich, must come again!"
3792,"The Cookshop is full of yummy foods..... like the burger and fries below. Cookshop as a variety of food but must options are American cuisine with a twist. Pandemic Options: you can eat inside with ""social distancing "" rules enforced. There is outside dining with a covered area and heat lamps. Mask is required when communicating with the waitress/waiter. Side note : tip well if you can.....support the restaurant business and the ppl working there."
3793,"TL;DR: Used to be good, but now it has Bad management, undercooked food, and inconsistent service. I went to cookshop 2 weekends ago, and the experience made me not want to go there again. When I got there, although they had quite a large outdoor seating area, they were running behind on reservations. Our reservation was at noon. We arrived around 11:55 but were not seated until after 12:15. When we were seated, it took a moment for them to get us our menus. Although our server was cheerful and had a great attitude, it was very difficult to get his attention, and we were served by 3 separate people between ordering our food, ordering drinks, and requesting the check. After we placed our order, we were given the wrong food. When our correct orders arrived at our table, my fritata was undercooked - it was soft and falling apart in the middle  - and the seasoning was inconsistent - the seasoning was concentrated towards the middle, whereas the edges were flavorless and just tasted like bland scrambled egg. I thought that my fritata was supposed to be soft in the center, but I realized it was indeed undercooked a few hours after our meal, when I got food poisoning (where my body only felt better after rejecting the fritata). At least the beignets were tasty. I came here because I used to love this place, and I used to get excellent food and excellent service. But I'm not likely to return anytime soon, as it seems their growing popularity has really affected the quality of both the food and the service."
3794,"Came here for late brunch at 3:30. We were thinking of coming in the morning as a walk in, but was glad we didn't. The only time available after 3:30 and even when we arrived it was packed. Had waited for at least another 10 minutes to get seated. The outdoor seating was nice spaced out if you are concerned about being too close to other groups of people. I was disappointed that they didn't have a full brunch menu and wanted to try the egg sandwich when browsing pictures, so i opted to get the huevos rancheros. It was good, but wished it had more balance against the tomatoes. I didn't feel like it even had any and mostly consisted of beans compared to what I expected. Overall, it was still decent, but not necessarily worth the price."
3795,"Drinks here are great! The Harvest Moon is a great fall cocktail with vodka and pumpkin infused notes. Presentation is beautiful from the Fall Fashion to their mezcal grapefruit cocktail. Would most definitely order the mezcal cocktail again! The food is also really good. We enjoyed the shrimp appetizer, it reminded me of seafood ceviche. Good starter to share. For the main, my friend orders the baked chicken which I liked better than my order. I ordered the swordfish which came on a bed of greens and grapefruit. For me, I didn't really enjoy the fish. It was cooked well done and a smidge dry. The combo of greens and grapefruit was just not good for me. Order the fries!! Perfectly crispy and well seasoned! They also give you a paper bag to keep your mask in while you eat. I liked the thoughtfulness of that and wish more places did that."
3796,Chic and reliable neighborhood institution. Large outdoor dining area and professional wait staff.
3797,"I was excited to come here for a while and we were finally able to get a reservation to celebrate a birthday. We ordered and wanted to make a no dairy customization to an item. We were told the chef doesn't like to make changes to the menu. Ok fair enough. I got the green juice which was great but very small for the price. When our entrees came I noticed that mine was something completely different from what I had ordered. My partner got the scramble and it looked like a half portion- tinny. (He was starving after) Our friends breakfast sandwich was the only thing that looked right. I was able to get a hold of the waitress and she apologized, took my plate and said the right plate should be coming out soon. 45min later after everyone finished eating my market vegetables plate came out. I looked at it and it was missing the poached egg. I immediately asked the man that brought it out if an egg was supposed to be on top? He said yes and just stared at me. I asked if he could bring one out... he said yes. 20 more min and no egg. I finally asked the waitress if she can get that egg. 15min later it arrived and it was pretty much raw. She said the chef normally doesn't work brunch and apologized. Seems like the chef makes his own changes to the menu... I was expecting to maybe get that dish complementary or even a free dessert but nothing. And for a birthday too. Going out to brunch is about eating with friends and it ruins the experience when your dish is wrong twice and you end up eating an hour after everyone else is done. I don't think I'll be back."
3798,Second time here. Comfortable outdoor seating. Their pizza was great. The waiter was attentive. I am definitely going back.
3799,"Pretty solid place! My gym partner always wanted to try out this place and we decided to go here before our workout. We made a reservation for 1245 PM and we were running a few minutes late. I called Cookshop to let them know we might be 10 minutes late and they informed us that they'll be able to hold our tables for 15 minutes. SWEET! When we arrived, we gave our reservation name and were seated right away. Our server was very friendly and attentive and sweet. I decided to go with the Green and Grains bowl because I figured I'll need the nutrients and didn't want to get anything too heavy prior to the workout. I did also order the Cinnamon bun because I was craving something sweet. My gym partner got the pancakes with a side of scrambled eggs and bacon. I had some of his eggs and they were very fluffy and had the perfect amount of salt. My bowl was also very delicious and nutritious. I also had a bite of my friend's pancakes and it was just as delicious. Had a good amount of fluffiness :)"
3800,"Hard to believe the good ole' days were just 2 years ago I used to walk down to Keste for the $5 pie special with my toddler and we would always have the best meal and the nicest service and well now those days are sadly over in the West Village.   But thank goodness I realized Keste is open downtown.  Nothing beats their Neapolian pie.  Thanks Keste.   Stay healthy, hard workers thru this crazy time.     I was going to 'retire' today after so many years of Yelping.  But good food/pizza like your's makes me continue on this next year."
3801,It's so satisfying to find a friendly and welcoming pizza joint with quality pies too!  I ordered the Vesuvio and enjoyed it. Highly recommend!  Grazie mille!!
3802,"I really was expecting a different sort of pizza. When I heard it was thin crust I thought it would be crispy, which it isn't. The crust is the consistency of naan bread. When you pick it up with your hands, the slice needs to be folded in half so that it doesn't buckle. The flavor is very good, though. I had the pistachio pesto with sausage pie and my daughter had the Keste pie, which was mozzarella, prosciutto and arugula. The service was very friendly and quick. I just wish the crust were crispy, that's all!"
3803,"Had a private event scheduled for 6 months with a binding contract and even paid a non-refundable deposit.  Last minute they told me they wanted to cancel because they no longer wanted to host the event.  The business has been run terribly unprofessionally by sleezy people, and the food has been steadily declining since the location in the village closed.  It's terribly unfortunate, but there are much better options in NYC at this point"
3804,"I don't know about this one, guys. The pizza was certainly tasty, but the whole service and atmosphere leave a lot to be desired. (And, I feel it's important to note that I lived in the city for many years back in my younger days, so I know how things work there.)Took my daughter on a quick NYC trip to do all things Christmas and of course, we had to have some pizza. We'd been snacking and eating junk all day, so I checked Yelp to find a sit down restaurant (aka, someplace that serves vegetables!) I'd made reservations and showed up right on time. We proceeded to be ignored, while the host took care of 2 people who walked in and positioned themselves in front of us. We stood there for quite a while and honestly, what actually infuriated me was seeing the owner (at least the person who's photos are plastered all over the promos in the restaurant) look to the front multiple times and continue to just stand around in the dining room. I would never have felt this way had he been busy in the kitchen, but no-- he was just hanging around, shooting the sh!t with his employees. When wr finally got seated, the service was fine. I did feel a bit talked down do when I asked questions about our order, but thankfully I'm not the kind of person who worries too much about other people's opinions of me! The salad was fine (the walnuts would have been better toasted), but my daughter loved her meatballs and the pizza was pretty darn tasty.If we were ever in the area, I would consider takout from here. But let's get real, there's so many great places to eat in the city, I likely wouldn't waste my money here."
3805,"We love Keste`...go for their lunch hour and order a $5 Margherita pizza. It is perfect. The dough is light, well seasoned, and you could taste the fresh basil, tomatoes, and mozzarella. We would get it again any day of the week. The staff is nice enough. The truffle burrata is also a part of their lunch special and the taste is spot on. Their menu items have changed over the years though so go to their site for their most up to date menu. Their potato croquette is something kids may enjoy, it has a light flavor, just mashed potatoes inside, could have been tastier, and it's a small portion. The meatballs are a pass. It wasn't soft, just mushy and tasteless, which was surprising. Stick with the pizza here though. We look forward to trying different pizzas the next time we come and we will update you once we do."
3806,"There wasn't one thing I didn't like about this place. I really enjoyed this restaurant and glad I picked it last minute. I ordered the calzone without the salami and it was delicious. The dough, sauce and cheese tastes so fresh. My friends truffle pizza looked amazing and so did the aperol spritz. It felt safe to eat here, they have barriers and sanitize the table well. One thing is I wish they had hand sanitizer, which luckily I did bring some. Oh and they had heat lamps so we were warm outside! I want to come back and try more items."
3807,"Dropped in for lunch, which is a great deal by the way (tons of interesting pies to choose from for around ~$12). I tried the pistachio and sausage pie which tastes a lot better than it sounds and another pie with smoked mozz (well executed, but not for everyone due to its strong smokey notes). The crust is also very good and had the right amount of char. It was thankfully not as doughy as other places that sell personal pies. I'll definitely be back."
3808,"Pizza was delicious! Got the Montanara Truffle and Macellaio (the Butcher) and chocolate gelato. The Montanara has a fried dough, which definitely added a nice texture to the pizza. The service was great, everyone got a nice check in from the manager some time throughout their meal. The only thing that was a little weird to me was that they sat a majority of their patrons in the front little room, when the rest of the restaurant was completely open. I understand why they would do that, to make the restaurant look busy and the server won't have to walk around as much,  but in the current situation it was odd. Overall a good experience! Would definitely recommend!"
3809,"As a celiac - I'm VERY sad this place closed during the pandemic (I tried calling so many times to get pizza but they're not able to deliver to my hood and are always closed in the afternoon when I'm around the neighborhood).However - thankfully their Fidi location is still open, and serving GF celiac safe pizza with ridiculously tasty crusty Naples style pizza! Granted they forgot the sausage on my last pizza (made for a sad meal) so check your takeout before leaving. I'm grateful these guys exist and understand the need for a separate oven for GF celiacs - and excited to see them open up on gold belly for US wide delivery!"
3810,"My friends and I came to Kesté around 5pm on a Friday.  When we arrived, the restaurant was about a quarter full, so we were seated immediately.  When we left around 6pm, the restaurant was almost full, so if you can, try to get there early so you do not need to wait!  The interior has a casual, homey vibe.Kesté specializes in Neapolitan pizzas, so you won't find the NYC style pizza here.  We ordered a margherita with mushrooms ($16), Macellaio (The Butcher) ($24), and a truffle burrata pizza ($25).  The Butcher included tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, sausage, porchetta, Crespone salami, prosciutto di Parma, basil, and extra virgin olive oil.  The truffle burrata had home-made burrata filled with black and white truffle cream, grape tomatoes, basil, prosciutto di Parma, and extra virgin olive oil.  Each pizza was about 10 inches in diameter.  You could split one if you're not that hungry, but if you come starving, one pizza should satisfy you.  We all enjoyed our pizzas.  It's the perfect balance of crust and toppings.  The pizza also has a juicy quality without being too heavy on the oil.  Service at the restaurant was average.  They did one check-back and filled our waters once.  Although I did thoroughly enjoy my pizza, the steep pricing will only have me coming back once in a while."
3811,"Keste Pizza & Vino is not your standard New York pizza. Keste serves real deal Neapolitan pizza with key ingredients imported from Naples. The flour and the tomatoes come from Naples and they are the secret to amazing pizza. The base and crust are perfectly cooked, thin but chewy. We had a pizza and a calzone. Both were terrific. Service was fine and the wine lIst was adequate. Cheaper than a flight to Napoli!"
3812,"Came here with 2 friends, love that they have $5 pies. I ordered the marinara (I just wish there was a little more basil) my friends ordered the margherita & margherita w/ sausage. They provide red pepper flakes and a spicy olive oil - which I'm obsessed with because I LOVE spicy food. For appetizer we ordered the burrata which was also really yummy and creamy. To be honest, I'm not sure if I would come back for the regular priced pies, as they are mostly $15+. Overall quick& efficient service, would definitely come back!!"
3813,"Amazing Lunch Special!! If your in the area looking for a great cheap lunch here is where you should head. The have 11' basic personal pizzas for $5, $5 salads and special 8' pies for around $10-$12.I choose one of the speciality pies; it had pistachio pesto, sausage and mozzarella for $11. Honestly is was amazing! I was a little wary about how good it would be because of how many stickers this place has on the door talking about how it's the best this place deserves all of those. One of the best pizza's I had in a very long time. The table held a bottle of spicy oil which took this already great pizza to even higher heights. As much as I wanted to get a glass of wine, $11 for a Pinot during lunch is too steep for me. There are so many good places with cheaper drinks it wasn't worth getting a glass of wine the same price as my pizza. I took a star off for how in my face the servers were. Please just let me eat without you hovering over me with the need to fill my glass of water every time I take a sip. Breathing room is my friend please respect it."
3814,"Oh Keste...I can't even come up with the words to properly express my love for your pizza. So, I'm a gluten-free diner. Finding decent gluten-free pizza is really tough, even in New York. Unless it's a gluten-free only establishment, most pizza places offer this generic gluten free crust that gets so crispy, it's more like a pizza cracker.Not Keste.The crust is soft and chewy...just delicious. The taste is strikingly similar to how normal pizza tastes, which is some thing that is gluten-free diners need. If you are into white pizza, get the Pizza Del Re. You won't be disappointed."
3815,"Unbelievable that your gluten free pizza is made with wheat flour. Celiacs and intolerant people alike almost always have an allergy to wheat (not just gluten issues). Any time I have had your pizza, I am destroyed for over a week, have rashes for a month. It is delicious, so I have done it twice with a killer hangover. Yesterday, I had one slice at a mate's. The reaction was so intense from a small slice, I rang to find out exactly what was in this diabolical Gf pizza, only to find you are using WHEAT FLOUR. Guys, this is deceptive, at best. I have already texted a host of GF mates in Manhattan. They are horrified and will not be eating your pizza again. Really not cool guys."
3816,"Kesté was recommended by a friend of mine. It's not ""New York"" pizza. It's Neapolitan pizza, so this is not the place for you if you're looking for New York pizza - because I made that mistake BUT Keste is surprisingly very delicious. Based upon the host's recommendation, I ordered the most popular, signature pizza: keste! Go figure! It's tomato sauce, imported buffalo mozzarella, prosciutto di Parma, arugula, gran cru pecorino, basil, made with extra virgin olive oil. What's great about Keste is that they offer a nice section of gluten free options.This location is very small, so be prepared to wait for a table. We were informed that the Fulton location is much larger and can accommodate large parties. The service was on point. Everyone was friendly and professional. Prices are a bit high... my pizza was $21. And yes, I easily finished it myself. If you're in the neighborhood, definitely check out Keste. I noticed a Michelin Award in the window :)"
3817,"I've ordered their gluten free pizzas from Goldbelly twice. It's the best gluten free crust on Goldbelly. This is 5-star quality pizza. The toppings are great, and I was raised by real Sicilians. I'm only deducting one star because they forgot the pecorino romano on my last order. I will be ordering again soon, though."
3818,"It's not just pizza. Although the pizza is great. The service is number one. The fried calzone is fantastic. Like I said it's not just pizza. Try their lasagna and their meatballs. Also, if you and some friends want to make your own pizza Roberto has classes with some wine. You have to try Keste."
3819,Tasty and cheap. The perfect date space. Has a bathroom and it is always clean.The waitstaff is always awesome and the hot oil - you must use. Do not doubt me. Use it. It's incredible. Don't forget to tip well - they are just so nice!
3820,"I popped in expecting to order a Croque Madame -- one of my all time faves.Ended up VERY happy with the Jambon Cru. (Steamed eggs are much underrated, IMHO.)My husband was almost giggly over the high caliber of his pain au chocolat. (Yeah. That's his weakness time and again.)Hoping to nab the scrambled eggs with salmon on my next trip to Buvette."
3821,"BEST. ALMOND. CROISSANTS. EVER.I swear the pastry chef is hiding crack in these babies. By far, these are the best almond croissants I have ever tasted. If you have the sweats for sweets, please order them. Imagine a perfectly nutty, crispy, flaky exterior with soft, buttery almond paste interior in every bite. Worth it? Oh, you know it!Do come early. The line wraps around the block by 10ish & you sure as hell don't want FOMO by not visiting Buvette!"
3822,"Delicious French breakfast here! I recommend coming here early to avoid the lines. My friend and I came here near opening time and there were plenty of seats available, but the time we finished eating there was a long line of people waiting to be seated. We got the Belgian waffle, croque madam, and the jambon cru. They are served on small plates so you can order one for a small sized breakfast or order a few tapas style to share with friends! My favorite was the jambon cru. The steamed eggs are deliciously creamy and light. The Belgian waffle was my second favorite. The waffle was crunchy, light and airy, and it was served with fresh cream and berries."
3823,"Yes- worth the wait. I've been here a few times now and the breakfast is out of this world. While it is on the pricier side, it's worth it if you love breakfast and want a little taste of France. You cannot make a reservation for breakfast. It is first come, first serve and you wait in line outside until a table for your party size is available (vs giving your number and coming back when table is ready). We went on a Saturday around 10:30 and it was about 20 minutes for the wait. The line usually wraps around corner but it goes relatively quickly, so don't be put off. We both ordered the jambon cru, americano, and split a scone. And the scone was so delicious that I returned 3 days later for another.  The coffee is also the perfect strength, and the scone is flaky on the outside but soft and buttery on the inside served with orange marmalade and homemade creamy butter."
3824,"The other night, I was ruthlessly sabotaging my circadian rhythm by indulging in revenge sleep procrastination. This is otherwise known as mindlessly scrolling down on TikTok in bed for at least an hour. But then my algorithm showed me a TikTok about Timothée Chalamet eating at Buvette.And hey. If this place is good enough for Timmy (and me), it's good enough for you.In some ways, Buvette in the West Village feels more stereotypically French than the Buvette in the 9th arrondissement of Paris--I was lucky enough to visit the original Paris location before visiting the New York location. The location on this side of the pond romanticizes the American idea of Paris, so it's safe to say that the atmosphere at Buvette is one of the top reasons to come here.The other one? The variations of croques on the menu--yes, even vegetarians will be happy. My trips to Paris are honestly one of the few times that I ""forget"" that I don't eat red meat because I lose all self-restraint after seeing croque monsieurs on every single café menu. Luckily, Buvette makes it easy for me to not hate myself later with the croque forestier: a rich sandwich with roasted mushrooms and gruyère.Don't forget to cop a complimentary Buvette matchbook on your way out to really feel like you're in Paris."
3825,"Lovely atmosphere with beautiful cute and small tables, reminiscent of the tiny Parisian cafes where one can smell the delicious cappuccino and croissants of dreams.And buvette doesn't disappoint.  The menu is perfect - not too much so that they are perfect at execution and not too little so that one might be bored.  The croissants were delicious and fresh, but the stand out was the jam that accompany them - a beautiful balance of sweet and tart, and perfectly rustic that takes you away from your surrounding for quick second with every bite.Our steak tartare was extremely fresh with perfectly seasoned quality accoutrements.  Like wise, the croque Madame was just as good with pieces of the most delicious prosciutto.All in all, I could go on forever but Buvette is a restaurant that must be experienced first hand.  Come hungry, be ready to squeeze in small spaces and open your mind and appetite for a quick trip to France."
3826,"I came here at around ~10am on a weekend with my friend and there was already a line out the door. Don't be discouraged by the line though! It moved pretty fast and we were seated about 15 mins after we arrived. The inside of this restaurant is quite small. We sat right next to the kitchen which was pretty hectic. They also crammed a table of 5 next to us which didn't help. There were people walking by us all the time, but the waiter also seemed to forget about us. It took a long time to put in our order, and then also longer to get our food. We got the croque madame and the fruit waffle. Both were good, but smaller than I imagined. I was slightly disappointed given how much this place is hyped, but I imagine that sitting outside in the summer or coming at a slower time would result in a much better experience!"
3827,"We had a great birthday brunch there for me-10:30am on a Wednesday. Sat right down (outside). Enjoyed a croque madam, the jambon gru, two cappuccinos, chocolate croissants, and the most wonderful OJ. Service was friendly! Croque was outstanding."
3828,"I had high expectations for this place because it's a very well known and popular brunch spot in NYC. We got here (party of 3) on Tuesday morning around 11:30am and waited for ~15 minutes. They did not have spots open inside apparently so they sat us in the outside balcony in the back. It was freezing out. No heaters. Our table was also more for a table for two, not three. Felt quite crammed, even for NYC.I got the egg toast with sun dried tomatoes and goat cheese. I can tell they use fresh quality ingredients and I appreciate that, especially since the dishes are relatively simple. The food was good, but came out cold. It probably felt even more so bc it was freezing outside. I think I would've enjoyed it more if the set up was better.I would be willing to come back if I could get a spot inside or at least outside in the front of the restaurant where there are heaters."
3829,"tldr: such a delight! almost feels like you've taken a mini trip to Paris.Food: 5/5Drinks: 4/5Vibes: 5/5Service: 5/5Must-Orders: the scone with house made butter!Buvette doesn't take reservations, so it was the perfect option for my last-minute group brunch plans. I was so pleasantly surprised! In addition to being located in one of the cutest corners of West Village, Buvette's seating and atmosphere could quickly convince you that you're in a tiny cobbled road in Paris instead of New York City for a minute, and I mean that in the best way possible. From the petite-sized tables and chairs to the full host of fresh fruit and wine arranged for display, this place is like a tiny piece of Europe in West Village. The drinks were pretty standard (we ordered lattes) but the food was to die for! We ordered the scones with housemade butter and also the Jambron Cru, both delicious and clearly freshly made (no cold bread here). I can't wait to come back."
3830,"This place lives up to the hype! They make beautiful food in a casual picturesque cafe setting. Service is great as well. I came on a weekday morning and didn't have to wait, but I've heard it can be tough to get a table on the weekend. I'm not sure it would necessarily be worth a long wait, its just breakfast after all, but for my experience, it was easy and super tasty. Great for people watching and to have breakfast aloneFollow me on Instagram @eatenbysteph"
3831,"I think that if you're going to come here, you have to buy into the French dining experience. You cannot be in a rush. You are eating to savor flavor. You are not eating for volume or comfort.The coffee was delicious. On a hot summer day, the iced Americano was perfect. So much flavor in the coffee.Most of the breakfast / brunch items here are various forms of things on toast, whether it be a croque madame / monsiuer, scrambled egg, avocado, etc.These things are small. They come on small plates.Despite this, there is a lot of fat packed into these dishes, so they are quite filling.I had the croque madame. Rich. Crusty bread. Crispy melty gruyere. Salty ham. Soft yolked egg perfectly cooked on top. Hard to go wrong with this combo. But nothing in this version was particularly transcendent.For some reason we were moved from a table by the front door to a table in the way back by the kitchen, which was more crowded and noisy with kitchen staff.We were given complimentary almond croissants, financiers, and chocolate croissants to compensate, which was much appreciated.Overall though, the breakfast was not worth it for me."
3832,"There was a line to wait to get seated which is okay! Once we we were seated the waiter took our drink order. The orange juice was $10 and was very delicious. I ordered two of them so had $20 worth of fresh squeezed orange juice just myself. We ordered 3 glasses of orange juice, a Belgium waffle, and a waffle sandwich and an almond croissant. We waited for about 30 minutes to order our food, and so our waiter paid for our almond croissant. Our bill ended up being around $70.The food was average! Outdoor seating was cute."
3833,"Ah. What's not to love about this place? A tiny french bistro tucked away on a side street. A great place for people watching (if youre dining outdoors) and tiny sandwiches. Everything is served on the daintiest little plates. When your food arrives, your first thought might be: ""...wait should I have ordered five more dishes...?"" But as the meal goes on you realize that it is just enough! Like most french bistros everything is dense, flavorful, and hearty. Ive been here for brunch and dinner. Both options are amazing. If youre thinking brunch definitely get here early because it seems to be the more popular option. I would recc any of the croques and pastries. The curry mussels are also very interesting and delicious. If youre a dessert guy/gal definitely get the creme brûlée. Im still drooling over it."
3834,Cute little French bistro in the West Village. Waited in line on a Thursday around 11am for 20 minutes. I had the Salmon brunch with soft scrambled eggs and a piece of toast and an American coffee. No refills on coffee. Brunch was very good but in a small plate.
3835,"My favorite brunch spot in the west village. All the dishes are small but fantastic quality. The steamed eggs are soft, creamy, and unique. The Belgian waffle works great as a ""side"" to share. Honestly everything about Buvette is sensational. Come for lunch and try the Niçoise salad."
3836,"Cozy French spot with a small breakfast, lunch, & dinner menu of small-plates.It was extremely popular when I went for Sunday brunch (there was a line down the block), but since I came in alone I got in right away. Although I could have sat at the bar, I opted to sit at this awesome table for 1 person they had that was right next to the window (prime people watching seat).I got a honey latte, an almond croissant, and a toast dish that was covered in scrambled eggs, lox, and creme fresh.  I wasn't too big of a fan of any of it, but I will say that all of the ingredients were very fresh. They also don't have too many traditional breakfast options to choose from. Only have 2 restrooms, which was a little bit of a problem since the place was popping. Too make it worse, the bathrooms are downstairs and there is not a lot of space for people to wait Waitress was very friendly Open untill 2 AM5.5"
3837,"Food 5/5Second time back, and I got the jambon crue. Fluffy and delightful eggs, paired with fresh crunchy bread. Took my breath away, and I immediately inhaled the entire dish. I also ordered the espresso martini and WOW, can I just say WOW. I got the vodka one, which was a lot lighter than the tequila one my friend ordered. The intense coffee bean flavor was insane, paired so well with our mains.Service 4/5A little slow, but nothing to be unhappy aboutInterior 5/5The first time, we only sat outside so I never got a chance to peak inside. Although we sat under their cutest outdoor area with fairy lights and all, I peeked inside. It felt like as if I was transported to Europe, with the dim lighting and soft music playing. The dark wood really does it all. The bathrooms were downstairs and they had literal baskets of oranges and apples, i love it."
3838,Cute place but have to wait for  the line. Foods are fresh and staffs are nice. Down size is service is pretty slow and table is so tiny. You can fit 3 plates on the table.
3839,"This was my first time going to Buvette and had seen multiple people on my social media raving about it so I had to try it while I was in NYC. When we arrived there was a long line of people waiting. You don't write your name down anywhere, the waitress just comes down the line picking out groups of people based on what tables are availability. We waited about 15 mins only because they have plenty of outdoor seating and it was only 2 of us so there are always 2 people tables available.We ordered the croque monsieur, the waffle sandwich, two fresh lemonades, a hot latte and an iced coffee. Everything was very fresh and delicious. I feel like the croque monsieur had lot of cheese for my liking but that's just a personal preference. I definitely would like to try the croque madame in the future. The waiters were attentive and still following covid regulations as they ask the customers to please have their masks on when they approach the table and/or before getting your food."
3840,"Looking for a place to get a delicious coffee and breakfast and feel like you have lived in New York for years... then Buvette is the place to go. Buvette is part café, restaurant, and bar. Buvette is located in the West Village neighborhood in New York. As I was walking to Buvette I had to stop every couple of blocks to just take in the beautiful apartments and houses in the neighborhood.What my table ordered:-Almond Croissant-Scone-Croissant-CRQ Monsieur-Steak Tartare-CappuccinoEverything was delicious! I truly enjoyed my breakfast here and I was happy that I chose to come here on my very first day. It set the mood for an amazing day. I will say that due to COVID-19 they have limited seating and they do not have reservations. Make sure to come with plenty of time and with the patience to wait in line for a table. It is definitely worth the wait."
3841,"⁠I saw so many great things about this restaurant, their Jambon Cru (steamed eggs, prosciutto w/ shaved parmesan) especially. And I was disappointed. I knew the eggs would not be a hard scramble but it was SUPER wet. I hated the texture and it had absolutely no taste. Had to put salt and pepper, I even asked for ketchup and the waiter turned his nose up at me ""we don't have ketchup here"" ⁠⁠The french toast was fresh and my other friend thought his avocado toast was just alright. The latte was okay. I definitely wasn't in love. ⁠⁠Will I go back here? No⁠Do I think you should try it? My personal opinion... Eh don't bother. There are so many other great restaurants where the food is amazing!⁠⁠⁠"
3842,Love this place! The drinks are delicious. The food is tasty and fresh (though portions are a tad on the small side) i would definitely recommend the croque madam!
3843,"Kind of overrated, depends what you get, but overall great good great atmosphere.Eggs tasted a bit weird - kind of too soft and slimy- I know they make it with an espresso machine but it was not very appetizing for me.French toast was awesome very soft and flavorful never had it like that before it just melts in your mouth - don't even have to chew. Orange juice was out of this world- best OJ I ever had. Hot chocolate also the best I've ever had in my life- hands down best hot chocolate in nyc.Almond croissant was very good."
3844,"I used to think this place is for the tourists but I WAS WRONG. I visited Buvette on a warm Tuesday afternoon and most of the tables were already occupied. They take reservation on Resy and spots are gone super fast if you are looking for brunch time slots. I need to be honest that they don't have the best outdoor setup but not the worst I had seen. Service [5/5] - I showed up with my reservation and my host told me he couldn't find my name on the list but they had table available for my party. My server was sweet and welcoming. They don't have paper menu and you should check it on their website.Food [5/5] - We had the Almond Croissants [$7], Saumon Fume [$16] & Belgian Waffle [$16]. One order comes with two mini croissants and they were heavenly good. Portions were on the smaller end but three items shall be enough for two small eaters. Coffee was alright - it wasn't watery but not the best."
3845,"Buvette had been on our foodie list since we moved to the city in July. We we not disappointed! Arrived the restaurant around 10:30am (two of us) and we able to get in right way. We were sat on the back patio and while it was a squeeze, it was worth it for the food.Our lattes were delicious and the almond croissants were divine. I ordered the Croque Madame and it was cooked to perfection. So savory and was a lovely pair to the croissants. My husband ordered the waffle sandwich and while it was good, he would've went with the Croque Madame after tasting mine. Our waitress was so wonderful and she convinced us to try the peach sangria-so glad we did! It was delicious. A new favorite and I can't wait to return!"
3846,"Buvette is hands down my all time favorite breakfast spot in West Village. This little French bistro brings my heart joy every time. We came here 30 minutes after opening on Sunday morning, and waited about 15 minutes before getting seated outside. Our server was nice and super patient with us (there's so many things I wanted to eat, I just couldn't decide). We ended up ordering Cafe Gourmand, Buttermilk Waffle, Cafe au Late, along with a chocolate and almond croissant. Every bite was a delight! The coffee was great, the waffle was perfectly sweetened, and did you know their eggs are steamed in an espresso machine? I seriously have nothing bad to say about Buvette, and I wish I was in New York to experience it all over again. YUMMMMM!"
3847,"I've dined at Buvette several times, each time for its dinner fare. To be completely candid, I believe this place is overhyped for its absurdly small (perhaps European-style) portions that lack the rich French flavor I expect. Last time I came here, I tried the cold cod spread which was comparable to an appetizer. Wasn't terribly fond of the fishy flavor or the cold temperature it was served at. My friend, however, ordered the coq au vin (which also came in the most conservative mini pot) but we both enjoyed it. Crème brûlée was good."
3848,"Beware of ""woke"" restaurant.  They will scold you if you say something they do not agree with.Plus they expect you to sit outside in freezing weather.Good luckNever Coming back!!"
3849,"Great brunch spot! Line looked wait too long on a Saturday morning, so we came back Monday. We still had to wait about 10 minutes for a nice patio spot. Great portions and great freshly squeezed orange juice. Would not recommend backyard patio - too small and ramped. The front patio is 100x better"
3850,"My wife and I were starving on our first full day in NYC and we wanted a sit in breakfast. We were craving waffles and French toast and decided to walk from Hells Kitchen, to the high line, and end up near Chelsea to check out Buvette...... and it was totally worth it! Yes there was a bit of a wait but once we were in we were given great customer service. Our waiter recommended some delicious foods and we ordered the French toast, a latte, freshly squeezed OJ, and waffles. Yeah it had French names which I can't remember, but that's was it was in English lol. The food was worth walking a couple of miles to. The French toast had a delicious sweet syrup and berries on top which provided some delicious tart. The waffles weren't bad either, from what I had. The latte was smooth and perfect. The OJ was worth splurging on, as it was super yummy. Next time we'll stay in Chelsea just so we will be close to this wonderful restaurant!"
3851,"Still one of our favorite brunch spots. Most recent visit, we once again got the jambon cru and the waffle, as well as a chocolate croissant and a scone. The pastries are both great, and their eggs are some of the best I've had anywhere. My wife definitely had some FOMO on that and said that next time she'd want the eggs with salmon, perhaps with the waffle on the side.We'll be back."
3852,"We came here at 11:30 on Sunday and there was a line around the corner. They don't take reservations, and we ended up waiting for a full hour before getting seated. After, we ordered the waffle sandwich and the croque madame. The food took a long time to come, and the waffle that came looked a bit dry. The croque madame looked much tastier. Four of us got the waffle sandwich which came with bacon, egg, and cheese, drizzle d with maple syrup. However, they were inconsistent because some of us had runny eggs while the other eggs were solid. The waffle was nothing special either, it seems like something you can order at a diner. So the food was okay, but definetly not worth an hour long wait and the price was steep. It's 7 dollars for a coffee, when you can get much better coffee at the cafes nearby. Perhaps the dinner is better though."
3853,"The Jambon Cru is excellent! The soft eggs perfectly compliment the bread. I would also highly recommend the Cafe Miel, which is espresso with cinnamon and honey. The outdoor seating is super cute too. But be prepared to wait in a 15-20 minute line.. It's always crowded here!"
3854,"Buvette is such an incredible place, it is truly a gem of the city. Located on one of the most adorable streets in the West Village, it is near the location of the exterior building used to inspire the Friends apartment. You'll often see a decent amount of tourist nearby, but only few tourist know the sparkle located within Buvette unless you're a local. As most West Village eateries are, Buvette is TINY! They have expanded a bit with some outdoor seating, but the small space, long waits to get in are sincerely so worth it. My partner and I love coming here for brunch. I know it's a weird thing to adore, but they make the BEST eggs in the city. Including pics of our go-to brunch order!"
3855,"I went here for dinner and it was the coziest vibes. Amazing drinks, solid food and the staff was soo nice. Ordered gratin, walnut pesto, and coq a vin, nothing totally floored me but also didn't have anything i didnt enjoy. Big RT coming in hot with the 4.1/5 stars"
3856,"Took a while to get seated as this place is super popular but it was worth it! I got the eggs and prosciutto and it was insane - eggs were incredibly creamy and all the flavors blended together so well. Really rich, satisfying meal although portions were small and pretty pricey"
3857,"Came here for dinner on a Friday night. We had a reservation and were seated pretty quickly, would suggest a res as they seemed pretty full. They have a lot of outdoor seating, some of which is under a heated area and a few others along the sidewalk. The tables seem well spaced out, and was pretty warm under the heated section, considering it was prob less than 40 degrees out. My boyfriend and I got the coq au vin, steak tartare and the hachee au jambon cru. My favorite of these was the steak tartare. The portions are pretty small, but each dish was very flavorful. I would suggest at least 3 plates between two people. It took a little bit of time to get our food (prob ~45 mins to get the coq au vin and tartare), but they did seem very busy which might have been why. Overall I would recommend this spot for a date night. I'd like to come back to try their brunch menu, as that seemed pretty extensive and popular."
3858,Love love love!Location is great! Food is great! Price is def on the higher scale but it's the west village so it's expected. The potions could definitely be a little bigger. ...We went during brunch on a weekend and we did have to wait in line .. in the rain. The servers were busy so you have to keep up with it and make sure they pay attention to you.
3859,"I can't boast about Buvette's food (yet). Nor can I tell you about what makes this French restaurant tick as we'd finished dinner prior to coming here. But based on Yelp reviews and pictures, my goal was none other than to have a chocolate dessert- and it's right here on Grove St. in the West Village.From where I stood waiting for my desserts, Buvette is rustic inside and out. My guy with a French accent gave me the inside scoop on their tasty Chocolate Mousse. I also got the Apple Tarte Tatin- which I've had very good ones in Montréal and Québec- but this one, just missed its mark with the bitter caramel soaked apples. Desserts aside, French savory classics are all present on the menu: cassoulet, coq au vin, steak tartare, Moules, Escargots, etc. Don't know about those, but I can tell you about the most unique and silkiest dark chocolate mousse- which isn't the typical ""mousse in a cup"" or ""mousse cake"". Just don't be fooled by the crumb-looking mousse because once you scoop it up with a spoon, it packs on smooth and melts in your mouth.This should go without saying- but from my quick dessert pick up, this place draws in a nice outdoor crowd. And not even the pandemic, can't put a dent on Buvette's popularity."
3860,Stopped in after hearing about their Chocolate Babka.  Most of the outdoor seats were taken early evening around 6.Unfortunately they don't have a single Babka serving (slice).  So the friendly lady who helped me suggested I try a Rugelach as it was similar to the Babka.  Mini pastry with hints of chocolate paired nicely with my double cappuccino.Back to the Chocolate Babka.  I ended up getting a loaf to take home.  They will be okay outside for 3-4 days (advice was to not refrigerate as this will dry it out).  Amazing Babka!  Not too sweet and just the right balance of chocolate filling.  Family wanted another loaf or two!A good amount of baked items to choose from and friendly/upbeat people serving up delicious Coffee and desserts.  The Rugelach was similar but is not a substitute for the Babka which is not to be missed!
3861,This is my favorite bakery - I am a late adopter but their breads are absolutely amazing - the olive bread and French sour dough are exceptional - the staff is very friendly and helpful and they even slice the bread for you
3862,"Always the place to go for something sweet or a pastry.They really mastered them!!!Service is nice and fast. This is our place to get Rugelach and Babka! Absolutely delish!!!! The rugelach can last actually a few days and will still taste fresh. I actually try to avoid going near coz everytime I amm close to the bakeey I just need to make a stop and buy something lolAso tried their croissants which are YUM! Same for baguette!Coffees are also realy good, only tried the iced latte thoughDefinitely one of the best bakeries in ny.Would love to try more things from them.Def recommended!!!"
3863,Waste of timeFor the Hanukkah donuts. After waiting in 2 lines they had just 3 strawberry left. They could have told us while waiting in line. While I love this place it wasted my time going here today.
3864,"I absolutely adore their French sourdough, and the olive breadsticks are to die for. However, what they are famous for is their chocolate babka. To my surprise, I did NOT like it. And it wasn't just meh, it was a straight out dislike. The dough was horribly dry and the chocolate filling tasted watery. I don't know if I got a bad batch, but for me this is not worth the horrendously high price. I had many, many babkas in my life, but never one this dry and bland."
3865,"Two words: chocolate babka. My friend introduced me to this spot and we were lucky enough to grab the last one off the shelf around 1pm on a Sunday. They had a couple of the cinnamon ones left as well. It's decadent, sweet but not overwhelming, and overall a delicious treat! We also got the parmesan cookies, which were more like parmesan crisps but were good as well. Will definitely be coming back to get more and try some of their other pastries as well."
3866,"I ordered 30 roselach for my agency to go and everyone loved them. Super sweet, gave me a good window to pick it up and presentation was wonderful."
3867,Don't really get the hype. I got the pastry recommended by the staff and accordingly this was one of the most popular items. I tried it and it tasted like any regular small croissant with chocolate filling. I was ngl a bit disappointed.
3868,"COVID report: Breads has some outdoor seating right now. I was getting items to-go so I didn't see whether it's heated or not. The food: I stopped in during Purim to grab some hamantaschen and they were absolutely amazing. The apple was my favorite, though the chocolate was also fab. Chocolate babka is still perfect, too. Next time: I need to try the almond croissants and rugelach!"
3869,"This place is known for their babka and I was definitely impressed.Their babka was rich, buttery, moist and full of dark chocolate. Honestly, I was expecting it to be good, but not THAT good...I can't imagine a better version of this since it seems so perfect. Other babkas are typically fairly tasty, but are dry - this one has perfect texture.I'm looking forward to getting my next babka loaf soon!"
3870,"I come here often for the baguettes and the babka. The front of the store is the breads and desserts to go section. In the back, is the sandwich/salads/coffee section. There is outdoor seating as well. The items are not cheap but they are good. They can sell out of items in the afternoon especially on Friday and the weekend."
3871,The olive bread at Breads Bakery is literally a shining beacon of hope. It is so absurdly good I actively cry tears of joy when I'm eating it. It's perfect in every single way thank you so much
3872,Made it back here to try their chocolate babka ($15) and it certainly did not disappoint!! I would recommend popping it in an air fryer/oven/microwave before eating. Came on a Saturday afternoon and they were quite busy. There was still plenty of babka left but were going quickly.
3873,"I come here often - anything you get here is truly delicious. This weekend I was trying to place an online order for pickup, and accidentally placed it at the wrong location. The team at Breads had my order transferred and called me a couple times with updates along the way. Really awesome crew, made the experience great! A special thank you to Sarah who helped me get my order fixed! The customer service here is top tier."
3874,I've gone to many bakeries in NYC and this one is my favorite.  Their breakfast pastries are the best especially the cinnamon buns.
3875,"I can't believe i've never written a review for this bakery. if you haven't heard, their chocolate babka is A MUST GET. Go early because they sell out and you don't want to miss out on this treat. I've even had this delivered to different parts of the country via Gold Belly because I miss it so much. They always have something seasonal and Yes, it's worth trying. I had an amazing chestnut twist pastry over the holidays and I can't wait for it to be cold again so I can grab a batch. my latest obsession is their banana chocolate cake. Their linzer cookie is always a favorite. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? gogogogo"
3876,I came back for the Chocolate Babka!!!~ I finally came early enough to grab a loaf-- there was plenty still! I also grab the Chocolate Rugelachs and mini pecan pie tart. Last time I came in the afternoon and it was all sold out. Yummy chocolatyy delicious chocolate babka and rugelachs (which look like croissants).
3877,"We bought a banana chocolate chip bread yesterday afternoon around 3PM. There were dozens of loaves on the shelf and I took one at random from the front of one of the shelves. Today, 24 hours later, it is covered in mold. Was it moldy when I bought it and I didn't notice? How long had it been on the shelf? They should time-stamp their items. And I should be able to let the bread sit for a day without worrying about mold. It's not like it sat in heat or humidity, it was in an air-conditioned house.Our coconut chocolate chip loaf is fine. We're going to stick that in the fridge."
3878,"The best chocolate babka I had in nyc hands down! Even though it's a bit towards the expensive side, it's definitely worth a try!"
3879,"We got the chocolate nutella babka and the cheese straws. The babka is good; very rich and sweet so it is hard to eat much of it. It also tastes much better when it is heated - the dough becomes softer and less dry. The cheese straws were also yummy. We got them right as they came out of the oven so they were still warm. They were super buttery and cheesy; it kinda tasted like a cheesy, flaky croissant. 4/5 for the pastries.We went around 11 am and there was a short line that moved quickly. It was super easy to pick up the prepackaged babka, get in line, and order the cheese straws. 5/5 for the experience.Overall, Breads Bakery is overpriced and maybe a little overhyped but definitely worth a visit."

3881,"Breads Bakery is a New York favorite. I've seen several visitors travel home to other states with a Chocolate Babka in hand. It's a must-try and is definitely what they are famous for. They also have several other pastry options, some food options like simple pizzas/flatbreads, and a little coffee shop in the back. The coffee is fine but nothing special. Be prepared to spend according to the popularity of this place. I was considering trying some other desserts in addition to the babka I know I love, but a small little square of a pastry was ringing up at $9 and I couldn't bring myself to do it. The chocolate babka will put you back $15 but at least it can feed several people or last a little while! The employees were super kind about me changing my order last minute which I appreciated! Note: Dogs are not allowed inside and they enforce this but there are several outdoor tables available."
3882,"all i have to say is get the rugelach!!!! it's so layered and delicious, also perfect when you take a lot to go and pop them in the air fryer for 4 minutes if you have a long commute back and need some breads bakery at home. everything in here looks beautiful and is a bread lovers dream, their challah bread is also the most plump and gorgeous loaf i've ever seen, i'll be sure to grab one next time! the workers are all SO nice and attentive, very pleasant experience!"
3883,"No wonder this place has so many reviews. Their garlic bread is phenomenal and their corissants are exactly as delicious as they look like. The staff are professional and sweet and although this place is definitely on the pricey side, it's worth splurging on!"
3884,"2020 was terrible year for all of us. A few friends I lovingly called orphans were not traveling home for the holidays due to Covid. I decided to have them over to my house for Christmas dinner. I pulled out every Xmas decoration I had and spent weeks setting up. I wanted everything to be extra special for my ""orphans"". I even put in a makeshift tropical garden at the last minute at the entrance to the property. Rearranged furniture. Created a large table for social distancing snd created special touches all over the house and bathroom for visual ambiance. For appetizers, I served spicy shrimp in wonton cups with guacamole and  sweet chili sauce, warm blend of nuts, Brie cranberry pastry puffs and honey bbq cauliflower rosettes. For dinner we had a apple blue cheese salad, potato gratin stacks, candied yams, creamy garlic asparagus and prime rib. But the piece de resistance was a chocolate babka shipped from Breads Bakery in New York City. If you've never had true chocolate babka, you have not lived. Every bakery is unique in their technique. I chose Breads Bakery because they do not mass produce their babka like Greens ( which you can find at Whole Foods). Plus, they use a blend of chocolate and Nutella which creates a unique flavor. The order is fulfilled by Goldbelly. A trio of babka was $49. Shipping to Hawaii was $69. Bwhaa!!!  But, my orphans deserved it. They have all lived in New York at one time in their lives. I warmed the babka and served it with homemade whip cream. It was delightful and a wonderful way to end a perfect dinner during a difficult time for everyone."
3885,"The products are great, but I need you guys to be more transparent or efficient with your pricing.  I selected two small bags of cookies, and couple with my other items, the total was much more than I was anticipating.  If I had known the small bag of 5 small cookies was $10+ I would never have picked it up, and probably would have opted for one of the cakes that were similarly priced.  Then it was a whole ""ta doo"" to say...no I don't want that, and hold up the line.  That's awkward....no one wants that...so just price stuff and or make sure the signage is clear.Otherwise...good quality and tasty products."
3886,"I've heard that chocolate babka here is famous. I have yet to try, but they definitely have a delicious spread of baked goods.I've stopped by for lunch here on my lunch breaks at work, and I've gotten sandwiches in between a Jerusalem baguette, different types of focaccia, and cheese sticks. The quality here doesn't disappoint, and Breads Bakery is definitely a notable favorite of mine.Carb central and deadly to the waist, but it definitely makes my taste buds and heart satisfied!"
3887,"So after my friend brought me a loaf of Chocolate Babka I had to come in here and try it myself. There was a short line out the door but it moved quickly. They also had some outdoor spots where you could sit and eat. I was really excited to have another taste of their delicious babka and me and my friend grabbed three loaves where it was labeled chocolate babka. Unfortunately we went home and realized all three loves were a Leek or Shallot Butternut Squash Babka. That being said they were delicious but be careful when you make your purchase because they can look very similar especially when the sign is mislabeled.I left the bakery with the following items:1) Feta Bourek: Super flakey and the feta was a bit spread throughout so I didn't just hit one giant salty cove. Nothing too special otherwise but I was quite  happy (4.5/5)2) Olive Stick: I don't know why I decided to get this. I have been training myself to like olives and I can finally tolerate a few but this olive stick is just CHOCK full of olives. So if you're an olive fan this is perfect for you. They use a variety of olives so you get some taste variation and the briney saltiness goes well with the bread. I wasn't a fan personally but I could see people enjoying this (3.5/5)3) Cheese Stick: So delicious. I was just expecting like a piece of cheesy bread but this had so many nice flaky layers and it's extremely cheesy and rich despite how simple it looks. If you are a cheese fanatic. Definitely a must get. I could munch on an entire bouquet of these (5/5) 4) Jewish Baguette: Basically a very very sesame filled piece of bread and I enjoyed it more than I thought. There's a beauty to it's simplicity. The baking gave the sesame a lovely taste and the density of the sesame really allows that toasty flavor to pack a punch. The bread has a great bite and takes a bit of elbow piece to rip but there's an addictive chewy quality to it (4/5)5) Butternut Squash Babka: While I'm still very sad I didn't get a loaf of chocolate babka, I'm happy that the butternut squash babka was delicious in its own right. The caramelized shallots? on top were so rich and full of flavor. The pieces of butternut squash go well against the slight egginess of the bread as well. The bread has almost a cheesy quality to it. (4.5/5)Overall, I was tempted to dock a star for the mislabeling (especially when the chocolate babka is their star product and I'm sure I'm not the only person who made the mistake especially since with the pandemic I'm not going to be sticking my nose in each package to verify I got the right item) but the service was friendly and the food was great as always so I didn't have the heart to do that."
3888,"BEST BABKA OF MY LIFE!I used to work in a Jewish bakery so I have been following (and fangirling) over this bakery for a long time. Everything here looks amazing and I only wished I had the time and money to try it all. During a recent visit, I had the pleasure of being in the area near breads bakery and I knew I HAD to get the chocolate babka. I definitely recommend getting here earlier than later if this is your goal as well because these tend to sell out by the end of the day. I also got a savory boureka that was tasty.Let me tell you, that same week my friend and I bought 3 more chocolate babkas because they were THAT good. The bread is heavenly--like a cross between the best parts of brioche and croissant dough. So buttery and warm and the chocolate spread is amazing. Sometimes you'll bite into a piece that has an extra buttery sugary pocket and it will cause you to astral project out of this world. Definitely tastes best after popping it in the toaster oven for a few minutes.I recommend this place to all my friends and I can't emphasize this place enough. Seriously amazing and a MUST try in New York!!"
3889,"This review is NOT about the quality of the bakery goods.  It is about the customer service experience.I went in a few days ago to purchase 2 Babkas to give as gifts for x-mas.  I have purchased baked good from this location many times and they  are always quite delicious.What lacked at this visit was the customer service.  I picked the two babkas off the rack myself and brought them to the cashier.  I opted to pay by credit card.  The person behind the counter was totally silent during the entire transaction.  Not good morning, not hello, not Thank You.  Maybe it was because I did not add a tip to the receipt, but I saw no reason to do that.  There was no service provided to me by this person.  I could easily have used a self service check out and perhaps felt better about my experience here today."
3890,"We came here for brunch yesterday and left happy. Their ordering system is a bit strange in that you tell one person the order behind the counter and then repeat that order to the person at the register; we did, faithfully, and ended up with two more things than we originally ordered. Ah well--their loss is our gain.Savory stuff: the feta and spinach bureka was incredible, and we only wish that they would have warmed it up. The cheese straw was good, as was the olive bread twist thing.Sweet stuff: Our daughter ordered a massive chocolate chip cookie and we have to say that we were surprised by how chewy and delicious it was. We decided against getting their famous babka because they sell it by the loaf and we only wanted a slice and didn't want to lug the rest of it around with us, so we each got a chocolate rugelah instead. Fine, but we do have regrets about the babka!There's seating outside and this is seriously the only place in MONTHS where we have witnessed someone coming out to clean those tables. So kudos. Four stars--we'll be back for that babka on our next visit."
3891,"My favorite place for challah bread (fluffy, dense, not dry). Also love their croissants, pain au chocolat, and banana bread. Their pumpkin pie which is unfortunately only seasonal is also incredible - got two last thanksgiving! Have tried a couple of their other items but these are the standouts for me."
3892,I've been here twice and and love the baked goods. Both times I've gotten the rugelach and boureka. They are so tasty and baked really well. Next time I come in I hope to try the challah!
3893,"Found this place at random by using google yesterday, great find.   Always get Babka from Isaacs in Brooklyn when I travel to NYC to take home and wasn't in the mood to take the subway clear to brooklyn and googled Babka and Union Square and this bakery  came up (I always go to Bedford cheese and was looking for a place nearby).Best babka I've ever had (they put nutella in the chocolate flavored ones) and best cinnamon rolls also.   Wish they had more seating outside and wish they would also enforce the outside seating to customers only.   There was no place to sit at in their outdoor dining area and a few people were sitting there taking up tables that weren't customers.   Fortunately there is a park nearby to eat at in union squareCan't wait to visit next time I'm in NYC and get some more baked goods to take home."
3894,"My love affair with Breads Bakery began when I had my first rugelach. The butter laden layers of pastry and chocolate made my tastebuds scream with delight and I vowed to treat myself to these magnificent pastries for any occasion. If I'm feeling blue, I run to Breads for a comforting rugelach. If I'm in better spirits, I run to Breads for a celebratory rugelach. If I'm looking for a housewarming present or special item to bring to a potluck, Breads is where I go. They have never failed me.Over the years I've enjoyed multiple babkas of the classic chocolate variety and also the truly fantastic cheesecake babka they have every May. I try not to miss cheesecake babka in May, for I'll be kicking myself for the rest of the year because it really is that good. Another seasonal pastry I love from Breads is their sufganiyot, which are these amazing donuts filled with cream that are only sold during Chanukah. You should see the way my eyes light up when I bite into one, it's cartoonish, and it is a look of pure joy.Their pastries alone would make this a solid five star business, but their savory bites are just as good! They have amazing focaccia bread with olives, an excellent tunisian croissant sandwich with olive oil soaked tuna and a hard boiled egg. I've enjoyed shakshuka bread and tasty frittatas here as well. It's hard to go in just to choose one item. Fortunately, I find myself at Breads very regularly. This might be one of my first stops I make once I can leave my house again. Until then I'll be dreaming of the day."
3895,I love breads bakery but the new UES location really has to get their act together. The baguettes are always really burnt and any half way decent baguette is sold by 2:00.Additionally they run out of popular items like bread sticks every day by 3:00.I'm very excited you opened an UES location but please learn from your mistakes and prepare accordingly. Many people are getting very frustrated.
3896,Where do I even begin. Breads has by far the most delicious chocolate babka hands down that I have had in NY. It's moist but flakey and the perfect kind of chocolatey. Their pain au chocolats are also amazing along with their almond croissants and cheese sticks. Everything is amazing. I know this sounds like a rant about how awesome it is but it really is that good. If you're in the city and can swing by you won't regret it !
3897,"Incredible. I stopped by in the evening and got an almond croissant, cinnamon roll, and French sourdough. Everything was wonderful! The almond croissant had a great ratio of filling to croissant and the cinnamon roll was sooo soft and cinnamony."
3898,Got some mini croissant Rugelach to try! They were nice but very flakey and the chocolate is a bit sweet for my taste but overall very delicious!
3899,Good baked goods.  Ridiculous prices.  You have to be insane to shell out 9 dollars for a tiny sack of cheese cookies.  Are you insane?  Also 1 star for rudeness.
3900,"I discovered Bread's bakery through volunteering with New York Cares, this place donates any unsold food everyday to those less fortunate. Is really wonderful for the people who get their donations and might not otherwise be able to try out this place and prevents good food from being thrown out. Besides the fact that they are doing wonderful service to the community by donating their food, the staff here is extremely nice and friendly. I've had the pleasure of trying their chocolate babka and it's really the best babka I've ever tried! It's seriously addictive and I could probably eat the whole loaf by myself since once you start eating it you don't want to stop. They put the perfect amount of chocolate so you get the nice dark chocolate taste all throughout the crispy yet fluffy dough. They also have a great selection of salads, sandwiches and freshly baked bread. Cannot recommend the chocolate babka enough!"
3901,"We were in Flatiron area, so we came by for breakfast. We probably looked like total tourists when we walked in, taking in the smells, ooh'n & ahh'n at all the breads, i want this,  hey over here...look at this.  It appears the main counter for breakfast is in the back, the front seems more for if you want bread, pastries, grab, pay & go etc. Long line in the back, gave me time to decide what i wanted and sound like I know what I'm talking about when i order breakfast from the counter gal. We decided to get a breakfast egg sandwich on a poppy seed bun, a mushroom quiche and a almond croissant. Oh and a iced and drip coffee. All was delicious & tasty, well made, options to warm it up for you. Don't stray too far, they will put your order at the counter/register where you just paid. Seating is first come first serve, do what you gotta do securing a spot. A lot of people seem to meet up for little 1 on 1 meetings to talk about work, deals and IG photos. Prices are what i thought it would be, actually I don't remember, but it didn't seem crazy to me. Great bakery and breakfast place to stop by when you in town or if you work nearby. Great life decision to start our day off at a good spot."
3902,Amazing baabkaNever knew something Like this existed before came here with a friend and was pleasantly surprised and the flavor of the chocolate little bit moist inside the bread just makes it one of the best desserts or sweet delicious breads we have ever eaten. it's just perfect with a tea or coffee on the side
3903,If it was not for my girlish figure I would live at this bakery.  I love their croissants especially the almond filled.  The croissants have just the right amount of crispness and always are very fresh. You can also order some of the sandwiches which are also nicely prepared.  Staff are always helpful and nice.
3904,"Chocolate babka - always goodCinnamon roll -  probably the best I've had. Not your usual bready type, it's more light, fluffy and not too sweet, kind of like a croissant?Chocolate rugelach - like a croissant but sweeter and abit denser Highly recommend!!"
3905,"I come here a lot and love their butter pecan cookies and the chocolate babka. I've also tried the cinnamon raisin babka, but I'm not a fan of cinnamon so I didn't like it. Today I came here with a friend to try their coffee and it was really good! My friend had double espresso over ice and I had the iced coffee, and we both loved it. Great place for pastries and coffee."
3906,"Have only been to the Lincoln Center/Bryant Park stand until we finally tried the Union Square location. As expected, it was great. The aroma of all the baked goodies is so amazing and I wish my house could smell like that all day (if calories didn't count)! Usually all of the baked goods at Breads that I've tried are great - Babkas, Jerusalem bagels, borrows, etc. This time we tried the souvganiot - chocolate and jelly flavor ($3.50 each). We were not satisfied at all. For $3.50 each, these donuts for Hanukkah should be amazingly fresh, fluffy, and filled a good amount with the jelly or chocolate filling. Instead, these donuts left the box they were in so oily and didn't taste as fresh as could be - which is odd considering we came in at 9am. The filling inside was the size of a dime (both in diameter and length).This was definitely a miss from Breads bakery which was disappointing. Glad we tried the souvganiot before bringing a larger order of them to a family Hannukah party! Skip these for sure."
3907,"I know this place is known for the babka, but when we go here the top priority is the cinnamon roll. NOM. Also a croissant. And a loaf of sesame challah that somehow disappears within a few hours. I also love their coffee. I got a bomb almond milk latte. I want another one now."
3908,"Came here after a boxing class (the irony is not lost on me) because it was literally right across the street! Got the chocolate babka and it was absolutely heavenly. The store is spacious with ample seating for dining in, but we had it to go. By the time we got home it was still warm and inviting. The braid was perfectly crusty and caramelized on the outside, and surprisingly soft and tender on the inside. The chocolate was sweet but not too much so. We savored every bite.Made a pact with my friend that neither of us would go back alone because it's too dangerous - we'll end up devouring the entire babka by ourselves in one sitting!"
3909,I ordered the centerpiece Challahs for Rosh Hashana WAY in advance and paid $145 for 2. On arrival they did NOT send them. All they said was sorry our bad we will refund you. We are out.HORRRRIBLE EXPERIENCE- they really are run now like a FACTORY ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE!PLEASE SEND YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE- I recommend Michaeli as this has now ruined my dinner table! THE MANAGER should NOT be handling customers.
3910,Fast Friendly Service!I asked for my fries to b burnt & crunchy .. (not crispy) CRUNCHY !!They were very sweet & made my fries over to ensure my satisfaction!!The especial sauce is so delicious !! & the sun dried tomato sauce is so yummy too !! Get extra onions on the side .. the Best They have so much flvrs !! So much variety to choose from!!Portions are HUGE!! I can't wait to go back
3911,It's fries  And loads of sauce to choose? People who work there looks over worked and stressed.Short staffedThey don't look very organized.
3912,"FRIES GUYS for the win! Pommes Frites serves up French fries made-to-order with an overwhelming variety of sauces. the Belgian eatery's interior is a little small, but the space is used really efficiently and there's a good amount of seating inside as well as a table outside. the interior is clean, casual, and comfortable. highly advise to eat your fries at Pommes Frites or nearby as the fries are best enjoyed fresh. fries come in three sizes: Regular, Large, and Double. i normally get a ""Regular"" and that is plenty for one and can feed two people. there's a small selection of free sauces but most sauces are extra (if you come in a group, get the 3 sauce combo so you can try different flavors). the fries come out hot and crispy--and soft and potato-ey inside. the garlic aioli; garlic rosemary; and irish curry are all great dipping choices as well as the free sauces like the ""especial"" (ketchup, euro mayo, and raw onions). there are heavier fries options like truffle fries and poutine. honestly, this is a great post-drinking option or a snack that you can walk over to Washington Square Park. regular fries are $6.50 + tax + tip. the staff are friendly and fries come out relatively quick. drops mic cuz everyday is FRIES-dayi outzzz"
3913,"Tina's take: 9/10I love love love fries and this place makes me love them more. Fries are always my go to snack and I take them very seriously. It was my first time here and the service was great. They are so welcoming and even offer samples. My boyfriend and I shared the biggest size and we were full for the rest of the day. They have beverages as well and the place is very clean. The bathroom is very clean and secure too , they even need to buzz you in. The place is small but has a big impact. Will be visiting again soon."
3914,"Back again as always! Never fails to be a great place for a late night snack. Got the Vietnamese Pineapple sauce and the Parmesan Peppercorn. Definitely would get the latter again. The pineapple sauce was interested, but the Parmesan Peppercorn was much tastier with the fries for me. Is it just me or did the sizes get smaller? Either that or my stomach is only getting bigger. If you're sharing, I'd get either a large or double for sure."
3915,"NYU-Washington Square Park mainstay. Belgian frites are cooked in sunflower oil and served in massive newspaper cones. Sweet mango chutney will forever be my sauce perennial. Unsurprisingly, they also offer poutine."
3916,"I have been coming to Pommes Frites for years! Everytime an out-of-towner comes to New York it's a must for me to bring them here.Every sauce that I had ordered was delicious we ordered:-War Sauce: 10/10 HIGHLY RECCOMMEND-Sweet Mango Chutney: 6/10 (this was a little disappointing especially since it was recommended by staff)-TLC: This was YUMM, I had zero expectations ordering this but ended up being one of our favoritesAs usualy the fries were fresh, the perfect crunchy and salty on the outside and soft on the inside. I was extremely pleased with the quantity of the fries that they give, HOWEVER the sauce does not. I wish we could get slightly more sauce with the amount of fries that we get per order, the one little cup just isnt enough per order."
3917,"Who doesn't love french fries? At Pommes Frites, they bring it to the next level. The fries are cut thick and fried to perfection - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. The really fun part is the variety of sauces you can get. Some of them are free, like ketchup, mayo, diced onions and others. For most, it comes with a charge and you pay less per sauce in case you get 3, so it is a cool chance to try some of their options at once. This time, we went with the War Sauce (mayo, peanut sauce and diced onions) and I really enjoyed it. If you try the fries with no sauce, it might feel like they don't have enough salt, but in reality they are meant to be eaten with the sauce and then everything balances out. Love this spot for a snack at any time of the day!"
3918,"YUMMY! Would have never stopped in this place if I hadn't received a rec from our tour guide. SO GOOD! Tiny space inside that is a little cramped (bathroom is cramped too), but a fun spot to check out. Love all the dipping sauce options. It's really all just fries and some fun drink options. Wish I was eating these fries right now..."
3919,"Looking for a late-night snack? These fries are it! I usually order online to pick it up in the store and they always come out piping hot and a little greasy in the paper bag - that's when you know they are good. Fries are thick cut with the right amount of crispiness. I would say one double frites is enough for 3 people.They have an array selection of sauces to choose from but my go-to has to be the white truffle ketchup! I also got their fresh watermelon slushie which was refreshing and paired great with the fries! Gave it 4/5 stars because out of the many times I have ordered from them, they always forget some of the sauces I ordered. Also when you order curbside pickup, not really curbside pickup because they tell you to come in to pick it up."
3920,"Oh yeah! It was a long time since I had these delicious Belgium fries, and when I saw that Pommes Frites moved to this spot long after the original burned down I jumped right in after a night out in the area. I love me some hot fries!The place is still tiny and narrow, but it has a cool Young Frankenstein meets Medieval Times vibe. Just a few tables to sit at inside with holes in the top to hold your cone of fries. Great idea!Three different sizes to choose from. The regular is more than enough for one person. So many sauces to choose from. I had the free Especial which is frite sauce, ketchup, and onions along with a horseradish sauce for a small charge. So good to dip the hot fries in which adds extra flavor.Very affordable for a different kind of snack if you're craving some spuds.They also serve beer, wine, and slushies here to wash it down with. Poutine too, eh!"
3921,We were craving something lighter than a traditional dinner and wanted a hole in the wall type place. Saw great reviews so we booked it across town and gave it a shot. Food was great. The girlfriend with celiac was excited about it being gluten free. The menu was overwhelming so we ordered a double and had them pick 3 sauces. They also have beer! I would definitely return.
3922,"Stopped here for a quick snack. It is small but a decent amount of seating inside and seems like a popular spot to hang out or study. The menu is pretty simple - just different fry sizes and more sauces than you can imagine! My friend and I each got an order of regular fries but the orders are so large that even with how hungry we were, we could've definitely split and been fine. I was recommended the TLC (tequila, lime, Chipotle) sauce as it's one of the most popular and it did not disappoint! It was super tangy and delicious. My friend has several severe food allergies but she was able to enjoy the fries because they are gluten-free and was even able to pick an allergen-friendly sauce (curry ketchup I think)! Overall, the fries were golden, crispy, and super tasty and would definitely recommend."
3923,"Wednesday evening, no line to speak of to order from this small establishment. Straightforward menu of fries or poutine, as well as a large selection of sauces.Considering we were a group of eight people, we opted for several orders of the large fries ($8ish each) to go along with a variety of sauces. From best to worst:Wasabi - a balanced kick of wasabi and mayoPesto - basic and refreshingRoasted Garlic Aioli - intense garlic, not much elseCurry Ketchup - less sweet ketchup, okay flavorTruffle Supreme Sauce - sweeter than expected, heavy on the mayoSweet Mango Chutney - not much mango flavor, no heatMajor complaint here is that the fries were on the burnt-end. Also, the spot had some flies roaming about, so best to eat at the table outside or a bar nearby."
3924,"I first discovered this place 15 years ago on a college trip to the city and always try to stop here when I visit, though this was the first time to the new location. As always everything was solid. We got an order of fries and 3 specialty sauces and split them all. At the end we lined them up from least left to most left in the cup to determine our favorites and we all pretty much agreed it made sense. 1) Black Truffle2) Vietnamese Pineapple3) Pomegranate Teriyaki4) Rosemary and Garlic5) Thai Chili Ketchup6) Peanut Satay7) Garlic Aioli8) Parmesan Peppercorn9) War Sauce (Mayo, peanut satay and diced onions)Looking forward to repeating some of these and trying new ones in a few months when we go back."
3925,"They're fries. I'm not sure how much else there is to be said about this place. Portion sizes are massive - split the largest size between three people as a meal and we were thinking it would be just enough food. We ended up uncomfortably stuffed with leftovers. At $14 it's a steal for the sheer amount of fries that you get. Tons of interesting sauce choices too - the truffle aioli stood out as one of our favorites alongside the sundried tomato. Fries themselves were above average but I've definitely had better. Maybe I'm just not the biggest fan of Belgian-style fries but I thought they could have been crispier/saltier. It was more of a potato than anything else. With that said, they didn't taste as unhealthy as they could have, which is impressive when you're literally eating fries as a meal. The place itself is a tiny hole in the wall but the employees were nice and there's some seating inside.Wouldn't rush back but it's definitely a cool, unique spot in the area."
3926,"I was beyond excited to try Pommes Frites. I figured that if they only did one thing, that one thing would be done right.  I hadn't eaten for a few hours but still only got the middle size because I really wanted to enjoy what I had and even that was enough for some to share.  They do a 3 for special on the dipping sauces in addition to the most basic ones being free but I decided to try two, the Irish Curry and the Peanut Satay and loved them both. So much so I spilled some on my shirt almost immediately.  I even like that the containers of dipping sauce are pretty big so if you are that curious, just get a free sample of a sauce and buy 1 or 2 tops for your fry experience.Pommes Frites is well worth the visit for the fries and the nearby sites.  I was only in the area to take a picture of the former Little Africa neighborhood I was beyond pleasantly surprised to see Café Wha? is across the street from Pommes Frites, which I wanted to try. So as a Hendrix head, I was in heaven."
3927,"I came strictly for the poutine and left with a question.Is the best poutine in the world really made by and Asian cook in NY?Well I'm not Canadian, but it sure as hell might be.The poutine for 2 feeds 4 and is loaded with cheese and gravy. The fries are , and the atmosphere feels like you walked into a bar in the lord of the rings.Great place to grab a few drinks and apps before crossing the street to the comedy cellar for a few laughs."
3928,"I know Pommes Frites is beloved as a late-night snack, and certainly nothing soaks up a night on the town better, but my secret is that sometimes there's no better lunch than a big cone of these fries with a few dipping sauces on a cold, stressful day. They're always reliable, always delicious, and although they're certainly not a light snack they're so well-made they don't leave me feeling uncomfortable. At $12 for a small fry (you don't need a large, trust me) and 3 sauces, it can feel a little pricey, but times are hard right now, I can't begrudge them the need to make ends meet! My favorite sauces are the parmesan peppercorn and the bordeaux, wine, and figs--still trying to figure out the perfect #3 to complete my combo! Also, if you don't go late at night, it's a surprisingly great space to hang out in. usually not crowded, and there's water, bathrooms, and somewehre to sit, amenities few MacDougal Street joints can offer."
3929,Omgsh. Isn't it great to find a place that does one thing but so damn well? That's what pommes frites is. They only do fries with million dips. They are open till late and the fries are quick and awesome. I got here after a long day and kinda just wanted some salty carbs. And boy did they deliver. This is like the perfect post drinks or while drinking spot. Highly recommend. My favourite dip was the sambal. So damn spicy
3930,"Had an early lunch here. This place essentially specializes in French Fries. The offer a large selection of dipping sauces. We shared a double fries, their largest selection of fries and had the horseradish, garlic, and rosemary garlic sauces. They have a limited selection of 3 draft beers and have soft drinks and other beverages in cans or bottles. The service was friendly and helpful. We a had to wait a while for our order fries but that meant they were certainly fresh. We had to wait a few minutes for the fries to cool."
3931,"Delicious crispy thick fries. Go here for some good fries. The cool thing about this place is that they make different sauces so it's a fun experience to try different sauces. They do charge for their special sauces so it can get expensive. The frite sauce is free. It has the consistency of Mayo and almost tastes like Mayo without maybe the acidic component and seasonings of it. I got the special sauce which reminded me of a cheesesteak because of the raw onions and ketchup mixed with the frite sauce.We also got a sauce that had pineapple. I did not like this one at all. Do you really need the special sauces with the fries? No. Does it make the experience more fun? Yes. Should you come here if you're craving some delicious fries? Yes. Also, the inside is small and narrow, and it's decorated like medieval times which created a nice ambience. In the back if you're lucky enough to come at the right time, you'll find a few open seats. There are holes in the table to hold the cone-shaped container of fries."
3932,"Rather you like the fries or not are all dependent on the style of fries you like These are a nice cut, perfect amount of potato inside and crispy outside.  Def a fan fave for Michelle.  I'm more of a steak fry or skinny fry kind of girl.   What made us both love the place is the variety of sauces. OMG.  We love having options and options were plenty.  Michelle Favorite sauce was the Pomegranate Teriyaki which is def a weird combo to say but hey it def workedWhile we were there. I listened in to the owner who was giving a food tour.  Great guy.  Def a must try kind of place."
3933,For some time I had been craving Poutine so I decided to check this spot out. This Poutine magically transported me to Quebec! It was amazingggg! The store itself is small - keep that in mind if visiting with a large group during covid restrictions. The staff members were friendly. Highly recommend trying this place out!
3934,So delicious. The sweet mango chutney sauce was my favorite of the bunch. Also ordered rosemary garlic and Parmesan peppercorn. Those were also tasty (but the mango chutney was more prominent/tasted the best!). Short walk to Washington Square Park also - was fun to sit down and people watch/eat fries
3935,These Belgian style fries are just perfect! Exactly what you want from fries. In addition there's so many kinds of sauces that you can choose from. What's even better is that you get taste test the sauces before you order.
3936,"Needed a quick snack after Comedy Cellar show and this was so good! Such a great idea where the sauce is the star. Fries were super hot and a great accompaniment for the sauces but personally I prefer string fries which would have made this go to the next level for me. Will definitely be craving this when it's raining.Rosemary Garlic: really good savory one. A basic sauce, which I may come back to next time after trying out all the other sauces.Sweet Mango Chutney: perfect blend of sweet and savory and my favorite. If I had to pick one sauce I would get this.Vietnamese Pineapple: hit with my friend, but felt too reminiscent of mango chutney which I liked better. Service and ambience: place has a medieval vibes for the decor. The store is long so seating is on one side and can get cramped. Friendly service. They let us try upto 6 sauces before we committed to what we wanted! Price: a bit expensive for fries. But the regular size was enough for two to share for a snack. The sauces are delicious, but can get expensive if you want to try more than one (a little above $4 for 3 flavors).COVID precaution: employees were wearing masks, and I think there were sanitizers."
3937,"Love this place! Amazing fries, they get it out in time and the sauces are fantastic. Highly recommend getting additional sauces (don't just settle for the ketchup and mayo they give). Horseradish sauce was amazing with the fries"
3938,"This FILIPINO Gem has been my favorite since I was in high school ;D It was sooo so nice being able to Uber it to the hotel during this staycation. The amazing staff even SUPER spoiled us because we noted that we are fellow proud filipinos showing love  THANK YOU for feeding our souls with your insanely yummy fries with our personal faves: Mango chutney, that truffle special edition one and good ol ketchup. (*Just add a note to your Uber order if your flavor isn't there, they kindly accommodated)The watermelon/pineapple smoothie combo HIT. MUST get for salty and sweet combo w/ fries!SO HAPPY you're in action Pommes Frites!! LOVE, order on repeat, and get again..it's like that."
3939,"---Pre-Covid Review---Let's get this straight. I will never admit that I am a fan of thick cut fries. They are the devil's potato and I will not have it near me. But lord forgive me, a proper Belgium Fry is my dirty little secret. I just got back from a trip to Belgium and that country converted me into a mayo-loving, thick potato strip-eating fiend. So of course when I learned about Pommes Frites I had to stop by.This place has so much business. I came by on a random Tuesday night (pre-pandemic) around 8pm. There was a sizeable line and they run the place as fast as they can but since they offer samples, it takes time for people to make their decisions. I appreciate that they ask you to stand to the side while you make up your mind though so you don't hold up the line as much.I tried several of their flavors and since I didn't want to hold up the line I just went with the mayo, peanut, satay, onion sauce, the Vietnamese pineapple sauce, and the blue cheese. The three sauces are an additional $4. It's pricey but they are a fun twist. That being said, I didn't enjoy any of them as much as I did the classic mayo. They were all nice variations and offered some levity to my mayo-potato-face-stuffing habits but at the end of the day I think the regular free classic mayo would be my top pick. The rest of the flavors are tasty but the creaminess of the mayo and it's slight tang are all the humble potato needs to shine its brightest.If I come back I'm sure I'll still get sauces but since they're quite average and pricey, I may just opt for a one sauce option or even make my own concoctions at home cause all I really need are those fried spuds and that tangy mayo to achieve true happiness."
3940,"Amazing fries! Really crispy and delicious. Not to greasy. Perfect for dipping into one of their millions of sauces. They let you try a sample of a sauce if you ask them. I love their mayo based sauces like the sun dried tomato or mushroom. The flavor really comes through. It can get expensive so I would just go with one or two sauces. Also I got their smaller size and the portion was still gigantic! Perfect for sharing but between the two of us we couldn't even finish! I also tried their poutine fries. Poutine in generally isn't my favorite but this wasn't bad. There's large chunks of cheese and the gravy isn't offensive since it's on the milder side. You should eat it fresh otherwise it can get really soggy. The poutine is also more pricey so it's up to you. I also tried their special poutine with sun-dried tomatoes and mushrooms. It wasn't really cooked with the gravy (just added toppings) so the flavor wasn't really there for me. I would pass if you're deciding on that. Otherwise, highly recommend!"
3941,"If there is a perfect fry it is Pomme Frites - thick & substantial but super crispy. It's even better than I remember it to be from when I had it several years ago. A standard size is perfect, maybe even a little more than enough, for two people to share. They do not skimp on fries that's for sure. We got the frites sauce (free!) and white truffle ketchup. We are fans of truffle so we loved the sauce (with the fries it has a similar taste to Trader Joe's white truffle chips) but make sure you know what truffle tastes like before getting the sauce because the flavor is very pronounced (as it should be). 10/10 would recommend this if you are a fry lover!"
3942,"The portions of fries are just humongous. I've never been able to finish the small fries alone, and the medium fries has served as a meal for me and two other people in the past. I have no idea how big the large size is and I'm too scared to order it. I also like that there are some sauces that they give for free. I've tried a few of the fancy sauces that you have to pay for, but in my opinion nothing beats good ol' ketchup. I also recently tried the mango smoothie, which was fantastic. The interior of this store is quite charming. First of all it's located below ground. It really gives the vibes of a medieval pub, which is exacerbated by the fact that they sell beer in those large glass mugs. It's a pretty cool place to hang out at night."
3943,"@pommesfritesnyc are thick cut, double fried to perfection Belgian styled french fries. With over 25 unique sauces including sweet mango chutney, Vietnamese pineapple, Black truffle mayo, parmesan peppercorn and sooo much more.On this day we chose the black truffle mayo, T.L.C ( tequila, lime, chipotle), Zigi's Mediterranean delight, and the Parmesan and fresh herbs. All of the sauces were pretty good but we enjoyed the organic black truffle and Mediterranean the most. The Mediterranean sauce reminded us of curry which was delicious. But if you do get the Parmesan and fresh herbs dip a fry into a different sauce and use the Parmesan and fresh herbs as a topper trust me you're gonna like it! The TLC was noted to be very spicy but honestly well all didn't think it was as spicy as anticipated. Ya girls over here like some spice ok?  It was trying to give but it wasn't giving in my opinion. Ask about their gluten-free and vegan sauces. Free samples are available if requested. They also offer slushy's and poutine too! Stay tuned to see where we headed next! Follow us on Instagram and Tik Tock at @halohalotakesnyc for more!"
3944,"Yummy yummy yummy I really like the menu they give a good amount the place is nice and small. And I like their hours , highly recommend if you love fries"
3945,"Normally I love Pommes Frites but this time my order was messed up. My partner was asking for the truffle supreme mix and was given something totally different. I don't like dry cheese on my frites, not sure who would. But I tried it and no I didn't like it at all. So I just made my own mix when I got home. I'm noticing a pattern with young men, the ability to not understand what a woman is saying. This is not good for people's business or maybe guys need to open up their ears more. I don't know my partner also pointed out my cooking skills maybe getting up to a higher level than the businesses in NYC that won't be able to keep up. My kitchen nickname is Ramsay Junior!All in all, they have made better frites but this time it wasn't it. I always recommend places even if I have 1 bad time because most likely I will try again."
3946,"Absolutely delicious! Who doesn't love a big cone full of fries?!The nice lady working the register was able to show me an allergen/ingredient list indicating which of the sauces were vegan! Had the curry ketchup, white truffle ketchup, and the Irish curry, all three of which were sublime.I'll definitely be back when I'm in the neighborhood, probably a blessing in disguise that I don't live too close-by."
3947,"Pommes Frites serves some of the most authentic Belgian style fries I've ever had in the US. The entire experience, from it being a small shop, to the many sauce options, right down to the paper cone like dish they serve the fries in is  an exact replica of the most renowned fry places in Europe. The fries are thick cut and crispy on the outside yet perfectly pillowy on the inside. What really knocks them out of the park are the plethora of sauce options to dip them into. They have standard ones which are free -- like their ""frite"" sauce and ketchup, and others you can buy additionally. So even though all they serve is fries, you could go for a different experience every time by trying different sauces. I personally recommend the aioli, truffle mayo, and frite sauce but I doubt you can go wrong. I go out of my way to frequent this place whenever I'm in NY as it is such a solid staple. I highly recommend even if you're not a fan of thick-cut fries -- these are true Belgian style and you will not find a closer experience than if you were to hop on a plane to Europe."
3948,"Definitely a Mecca for anyone that likes/loves/adores French fries.  Their sauce selection is unmatched, and their service is top notch.  Me and my friends love this place.... Highly recommend!!"
3949,"Always incredible. The sauces are always amazing. If you think you're craving fries, you probably are, and you should go to Pommes Frites."
3950,"Pretty good food but very little choice in there, their dishes don't come with any veggies or bread, you have to buy everything extra, so something that you would get in a 'Curry in a hurry' for $15 will set you back here for $30."
3951,"There is currently outdoor dining available with limited seating and the environment was good. The staff was friendly and attentive. Most of the signature and well-known Indian cuisines were on the menu. We highly recommend to have their 3-course Prix Fixe with appetizer, entree and dessert. We shared 3 sets of Prix Fixe orders with a group of five people and we even couldn't finish all due to the great portion. The food was overall decent, especially the Fennel Chicken Curry, it was creamy and rich. However, both soup, the butternut squash and mulligatawny, weren't our types so we only finished the chicken samosa. Seva Indian Cuisine is a solid place for Indian food with reasonable price and great ambiance."
3952,"Excellent food. Highly recommend the 3 meal deal which includes an appetiser, entrée, and a dessert. Great quantity and quality too. Dessert was on the spot. The rasmali was amazing."
3953,"I've been meaning to write a review for the longest time and now is the time. Seva is hands down my favorite Indian cuisine in Queens.This restaurant is located in Astoria, it's cute and cozy. The staff are the best, they are very friendly, super kind and helpful. The food here is delicious. I'm drooling right now just thinking about it. If you're taking kids your best option is butternut squash soup. It is delicious and its not spicy at all. I usually order their vegetable samosas and chicken samosas. It never disappoints. One samosa is huge and it comes with two sauces, one is green which is pretty spicy and the red sauce which is sweet. They all complement the samosas well.For the entrees: Their Saag paneer is literally to die for. It is scrumptious. It's Indian cheese with spinach. Chana Sag ( Chickpeas) and Aloo Gobi (cauliflower) are both mouth-watering dishes and it's a must try.One thing I have to mention is that I don't care about Lamb, however their Lamb Korma changed my taste about lamb forever. I'm not even exaggerating. Their lamb korma is my go to now. It is full of flavors and spices, the lamb is cooked to perfection and it melts in the mouth. They don't have much dessert options but their kheer is creamy, sweet and refreshing. Overall, Seva offers delicious Indian food. If you're in the mood for Indian, and you happen to be in Astoria, Seva will not disappoint you."
3954,"One of the best Indian food restaurant in queens. Their lunch special menu is super affordable and you get to try different things. I love their butternut squash soup, Chana Saag, Chicken Tikka Masala, & Garlic Nan. The flavors are rich, earthy, and all the different spices come together well."
3955,"Yum!My husband and I came here for our anniversary lunch, on a whim. We shared the Lamb Rogan Josh with Garlic Naan, and it was very delicious. The service was also great. We order delivery from here all the time and it's always very good. My husband is Scottish and really appreciates that they have pakora here, too! I do wish they had goat-based curries because that is my absolute favorite (especially with the bone!), and I can't seem to find a spot around here that has Goat Curry/Rogan Josh AND is delicious in other aspects of dishes. Maybe my quest for goat continues, but in the meantime I will enjoy dishes from Seva!"
3956,Looking for a place for dinner late on a Tuesday night brought us to this restaurant. Cool little outdoor area with a few tables and lights for ambiance. No issue getting a table for two.Menu has a little bit of everything but isn't overwhelming. Settled on the Green Chili Chicken ($14) and split the Naan ($4) and Raita ($4). Chicken has plenty of meat chunks swimming in a spicy curry. Thankfully had complimentary rice and raita to bring down the heat a little. Tasty overall and went well with the crispy naan.Service here is fantastic as the staff came around often to refill waters. Hopefully get to try this place again for their specials.
3957,"some of the best, most consistently high quality Indian food you can find in Astoria! I order from here maybe once a week (I'm a little addicted, what can I say) and I have not been disappointed once.My favorites have so far been the vegetable korma and vegetable tikka masala. Combine that with a classic plain naan and pakora or samosa... wonderful.The new location is beautiful and elegant, and service is very friendly and helpful! You go, Seva!"
3958,"Discovered Seva today and am delighted Excellent Indian food, top quality Service was prompt, courteous and efficient Will definitely return"
3959,"Had a lunch special today for $12 per person, choice of soup, protein and rice. I had a delicious lentil soup that really warmed me up.  I was waiting for my food outside for about 15 minutes and i was parked about 1 block away but it was windy and cold and i was not dressed with the proper winter gear.  Anyways i end up ordering chicken tikka masala and i asked for it to be made spicy.  I ate my food in my car, the soup made me feel so good as i was freezing while waiting for my food.  I was so hungry i didn't take pictures of my food.  Anyways excellent deal, call ahead to pick up your food.  As always parking is difficult so be prepared to find a meter and avoid a ticket!Delicious food worth every penny.  The staff is always attentive and be sure to ask for utensils, i didnt ask for them, so i got none... lucky for me. I always carry a little bag in my car with napkins and disposable plastic flatware specially now that there is never a place to dine in."
3960,"I'm am SOOOOO glad to be back in Astoria so that I can eat Seva Indian. Moved to NY 5 years ago and had a sublet in Astoria for a couple of months. Since then I moved from queens and haven't been back till now. I am obsessed with their chicken vindaloo, the portions are huge and it is sooooo spicy (which is how I like it), unfortunately on a hot summers day I can't deal with the sweats from a vindaloo, so I order the Tikka Masala, so tasty and just the right spice to it. Keep up the great work Seva."
3961,"If you're looking to grab some delicious Indian food... look no further. Seva is my Go-to Indian in Astoria. They have an amazing $20 prefix menu which includes one appetizer, an entree, and dessert. Truly can't beat that price for all that food. I usually go for the butternut squash soup which is 10/10 highly recc!! For entree went with the chicken tikka masala and ordered a garlic naan on the side to go with that. Chefs kiss* it was delicious. For dessert I ordered Kheer, which is like a rice pudding. Highly recommend! Enjoy"
3962,"Regular costumer at this Indian restaurant in Astoria.  The service is always cordial and appreciated.  The food is exquisite each and every time.  We always order the chicken Makhni, shrimp Tikka Masala, garlic naan and the lemonade and it always hits several spots.  Definitely a gem of Astoria that you don't want to miss.If for Indian food you're a diva,Then you must go to Seva!PS: food is definitely a lot better than my poetry."
3963,"I ordered on uber eats and the food was well packaged, fresh & taste so good ! They give you so much, you will have leftovers for sure. I will order again or visit once indoor dinning resumes."
3964,"Read a lot of good reviews about this place and can understand why they are a popular spot in this neighborhood.Seva's menu caters to the local non Indian community and their food reflects that. Seva's  food is about as ""American Indian cuisine"" as it gets.I ordered 2 appetizers. The tandoori shrimp and the lamb spring rolls both of which lacked any meaningful masala and which I found overall bland.Also asked if they had lamb shank or any entree with lamb on the bone to which they said ""no.""Overall I wasn't very impressed by this establishment but I can understand why the locals here enjoy it as it's not a traditional Indian restaurant."
3965,"5 years in Astoria and how is it my first time here!!?? As a vegetarian I'm always up for a new place with lots of vegetarian and vegan options. I tried the veggie tikka masala and I love my spicy food spicayyy so it was just the right spice level. I also love that this place is BYOB and it's right next to a liquor store. If you drank more than expected and need more, you're in the right place for your first date with that girl you're not sure that you like so much. They also have several kinds of Indian beers and the Taj Mahal beer was delightful. The prefix is the right price for the amount of food. The ambience and the service was so amazing, I really appreciate the attentiveness. I love this place and will definitely be back!"
3966,Super tasty Indian food! We've ordered take out from here twice and enjoyed it both times. I could eat a bajillion coconut nans and still want more. It has a subtle flavor of sweet coconut which mixes well with the flavors of the other dishes. My friends really liked the Lamb Korma and I enjoyed the Chana Masala the most. We definitely hope to eat at the restaurant soon. It looked super cute and hopping inside when we picked up our food!
3967,By far my favorite Indian Restaurant! I used to live in Astoria and this was always my go to! I no longer live in NY but always crave this place and had to stop by on my  recent visit. New location is super cute too! Must try! Everything is delicious!
3968,"Delicious food and sweet staff. Not much to say here except: try it! Be warned: the spiciness ratio is high. If you like a little spice, better ask for low or mild than medium."
3969,Enjoyed our dinner at Seva. We had the prix fixe with lamb korma and CTM. Great value with a samosa and lamb spring roll. I really enjoyed the spiciness of their flavours but did feel some of the chicken was over cooked. Great service and would come back
3970,"This might literally be the best Indian food I have had. I am certainly not going to pretend to be an expert on Indian cuisine, but I do eat it a lot, and this place is in the top 3 at the very least. I have ordered delivery from here a few times in the last couple months and have tried a few staples. The tikka masala is so flavorful, I got it with chicken and the chicken was still very moist (so many places the chicken is dry and over cooked but not here). The samosas are great, and the Dhania chutney (green cilantro one) is heavenly. The vindaloo is also spicy like it should be, but this heat comes with a purposeful punch of flavor and isn't overly acidic, love love love. Looking forward to working my way through the rest of the menu."
3971,"I am a regular enjoyer of their dal, chana saag, and samosas.Fantastic food and a really friendly staff."
3972,"Was excited to try this place out given the compelling reviews. In all, food was good but a couple of things detracted from a 5-star experience; (1) level of spice - clearly a highly subjective preference but this place fails to advise guests that the 'mild' level is actually pretty hot and more importantly - not recommended for certain kind of dishes (e.g., saag paneer). We like spicy food and usually enjoy a mild-moderate degree of spice but most of our dishes were just too spicy. (2) bad stomach reaction - we have neither allergies nor any known food sensitivities but had awful stomach pain post this meal. At times of Covid when health considerations should be front and center, this outcome was a bit alarming."
3973,"The takeout process was quick and efficient.  Flavors were not sacrificed!  I was a huge fan of the saag paneer, which has a customizable spice level.  The portions are very generous as well.  I would definitely come back!"
3974,"Seriously the BEST Indian food in Astoria, if not all of NYC. Chicken Tikka Masala was ! Their spicy is very spicy, but not so much that you can't actually enjoy the food. Great flavor! Great portions! All delish!"
3975,"Went there with my family, we order pre fix dinner and all of us enjoyed it. Great food and good service, what else there to say. Definitely coming back"
3976,"I have been meaning to try Seva for a long time and when that Indian craving hit, I knew it was time! It was also a chilly evening which makes this a great, soothing meal.I decided to go with the 3 Course Prix-Fixe for ~$18 which includes an appetizer, entree, and dessert. My sister also got the same thing so we can split the food and try more things! For the appetizer, we got the Chicken Samosa. For the entree, I got the Chicken Vindaloo and she got the Lamb Vindaloo (+$1). For the desserts, since there are only 2 to choose from, Kheer and Ghulab Jamun, we got one of each!The Chicken Samosa was pretty big! One is definitely enough to get you excited for the rest of the meal. It comes with a red and green sauce, both of which were pretty mild and added more flavor to the samosa. The chicken definitely did have a kick, so the sauces helped a lot!The Vindaloos are spicy dishes! We got the ""Regular"" spice level and overtime, they definitely had a kick. The Basmati Rice it is served with balances the spice well and was super fluffy and aromatic. The chicken and lamb were both super tender and delicious! There weren't that many potatoes but they were soft and tasted great with the meats and rice.Now onto the desserts! The Kheer was one of the best I've had. It is sweet, light, and creamy. After that spicy meal we had, it was a nice change. The Gulab Jamun is basically a fried ball doused in syrup. I'm a big fan but honestly one piece is more than enough!Overall, Seva offers great, authentic Indian food and I love the Prix-Fixe option because it enhanced the whole dining experience. If you're in the mood for Indian, you can't go wrong with Seva!"
3977,"Not the same as it used to be. We ordered the saag paneer, cheese naan, Aloo Gobi matar and the Gulab Jamun. The Saag paneer was probably the best thing that we ate and it wasn't as rich in taste as before. The rest was very mediocre. The Aloo Gobi Matar lacked flavor and consistency. The cheese naan was cold, had no cheese flavor and it was hard and lastly, the dessert was not warm and light. It was very dense and cold. Almost tasted old which wasn't desirable. I used to recommend this spot to everyone I knew but now I think I'll find elsewhere to go."
3978,"I've been coming here for 10 years and it's tied for my favorite Indian restaurant in Astoria, along with Taste of Bengal. Delicious food and really nice staff. The prices are very reasonable too, and there's a prix fixe dinner deal. I do wish they still gave the free papadam and chutneys though! Btw, they've moved locations to around the corner on 30th Ave."
3979,"Excellent Indian cuisine. Friendly and accommodating service. One of my go to places for Indian food. Navraten korma, saag paneer, garlic Naan, paneer makhani. All have been delicious.  I haven't tried something that wasn't great here."
3980,Please note this restaurant is not checking  COVID vaccine cards. It is a very tight seating arrangement with no outdoors. We saw a couple people leave due to this so for those who are uncomfortable skip this place.I love Indian food and the food here is decent. The naans and appetizers are great. We did not enjoy the entrees as much. I have had better butter chicken.
3981,"I don't leave Yelp reviews often but felt compelled to because I had such a great takeout experience here. I had a question about ordering online and the woman who picked up couldn't have been nicer or more helpful! I hung up, placed my (fairly large) order, and it was ready within 20 min, so fast. I was really impressed because it was so busy with people eating in, but they still were so pleasant and fast and the order was accurate! I don't eat Indian food often so maybe I not the best judge, but the food tasted amazing to me,  I LOVE spicy food and this definitely was. Also the value of the 3-for-$20 pre fixed was amazing. I'll be back soon!"
3982,"If Seva was in midtown, I would be making dinner plans everyday. But, my husband made sure this Friday was special to celebrate my passing a grueling exam. This was an earned meal! And a much awaited one! ;). For apps we got my hubby's favorite Vegetable Samosa and Chicken Malai Kebab (my favorite and the best again). For mains we got the Vegetable Tikka masala and Malai Kofta. For the bread we called for the  cilantro naan (really good). Of course I also got a glass of Cabernet because it was a celebration dinner :)."
3983,Seva was a fantastic dining and service experience! The vegetable samosas and butternut squash soup were especially delicious. Payel was an attentive and delightful server. She took care of us and our little dog too as we dined al fresco and took our time enjoying it all! We will be back very soon.
3984,"Ordered saag paneer, shrimp masala came with rice and it was the bomb. Shrimp one was very good"
3985,"Great food and service. I have been coming here for years, even at the old location. I recommend their stews: lamb rogan gosh, vindaloo .... Also appetizer: lamb spring rolls. All of their desserts are delicious."
3986,"The best way I can describe this place is if you live within delivery and/or takeout distance - this will be your ""Go To"" Indian spot.I never had it at the restaurant but can guarantee it's even better because Indian food is best served fresh from the kitchen.The menu is standard but in a good way because there's everything for everyone.I also like the portion sizes - you get your money's worth and there will always be leftovers.4/5 - more points are towards the convenience of this place versus culinary mastery, but sometimes you want that takeout Indian taste for a perfect night in."
3987,The pre fix (or take out special if you're calling in) I'd a ton of food and super worth it for solid Indian food
3988,"Delicious Indian food, one of my top places for sure. Chicken tikka masala all day. Get the samosa too and garlic nan"
3989,New location. Nicer decor and slightly larger. Excellent food at a great price. Friendly quick service.
3990,"Review for their Christmas Menu: I went on Christmas day, so I am not sure if they really don't have the prix fixe like the other reviewer said. I would be extremely disappointed if that were the case, but maybe it is time for a change...? But their prix fixe menu was perfection! why get rid of something that works? I will check on this on our next visit. Anyway, we came here for Christmas dinner. I assumed the restaurant was going to be full, so I was surprised when we were able to book the reservation just two days before Christmas. Over the phone they mentioned that it will be a Christmas prix fixe menu & we cannot order any a la carte menu items. The restaurant never got full the whole time we were there (around 2 hours). Service was pretty good. I think the short haired lady explained the menu items better than the other lady, but maybe the other lady is a newer employee. For $120 pp and for the ingredients they used, the price was great.  I just did not enjoy the Christmas menu as much as I did with their prix fixe menu (they used to have???) I enjoyed the appetizer the most and then dashi wagyu sushi with uni. I felt like their sushi/ Christmas rolls had very fishy taste/smell than I am used to when I eat high quality sushi. Maybe because the ingredients are not so fresh on Christmas Day since the vendors probably don't deliver.  Entree was okay. Dessert was okay. After trying their Christmas menu, all I really wanted the regular prix fixe or at least be able to order from their regular menu... I was also sad to find out that the heated toilet seat with disposable cover already on it was gone. It would have been perfect for the pandemic & the cold weather. I am still going to come back for their regular menu at another time when I visit NYC."
3991,"It's hard to rate Bohemian as a restaurant, because given the referral system for reservations, more homely setup, and more experimental style, it's more of a pop-up / exclusive club. Given that, I think there are two main ways to judge the place -- as a more private establishment to hang out and enjoy as a hospitality standpoint, or as a traditional dine and drink restaurant.From the dining side, the prices are high, and at the fine dining level, except without fine dining characteristics. The has a more rustic, countryside and home-vibe to it, rather than elegance and sophistication (although tbh I'm not all for that all the time either, just to compare to ""fine dining"" standards). Given that, charging high prices for meats and materials that you can likely get yourself for a lot cheaper makes the value of coming to Bohemian for food rather not worth it. For example, if you get their Washugyu meat selection, it's pretty much just some roasted potatoes, carrots and beets, along with some standard cooked meat, put on a wooden board. Is it special? Not really. However, the creativity of some other dishes, uniqueness that you can't get it at any other Japanese restaurant in the city (Foie Gras rice with Pork Belly? Hello?), maybe not anywhere else in the world, and the diversity definitely make this a special place to have select moments. Drinks are also rather expensive, something like 4x markup for pure bottles, BUT -- the cocktails are very reasonably priced, and if you need something on the value side, that's where you get it.So as a restaurant? I think Bohemian is an overpriced decent (but not mindblowingly good) restaurant.Now...as a place of hospitality, we're in the top of the top. Is it because of the referral system? Yes, that's very hard to do, and although I alluded to the price earlier, I think the private-ness and the small scale of the restaurant forces them to charge much higher prices for what you get. However, if you take in that you basically have an exclusive opportunity to come here, that's a premium that you'll have to pay. Is it nice to have? Yes, because the city is always getting more crowded, and having a place that can reliably provide service and high-quality food to you is something that you will find hard to get, or have to pay exorbitant prices for anyway.Bohemian is special because it is a one of one, run in a style that nobody can easily replicate, and has stayed true to its character as a true hole in the wall that is inaccessible to the public, meaning it will be able to maintain that status for a while. That effort should be commended, and I hope that all that have been here can enjoy the experience for a long time to come."
3992,Food was underwhelmingI was very excited to try this placeHonestly forgot I tried the burgers before so got it again and it was not worth it. I thought that the last time I tried it lolBranzino was so good! I love the veggies it came with and everything went well togetherWagyu was so buttery and good but also too heavy. I liked it with the salt. Cheesecake was good! I ordered it since it was my bf bday and it was really nice that it was on the house. I expected to pay but it being complimentary was really niceService was really good but slow. It's cool to try but not sure it's worth the money.
3993,"It's been a while since I proposed to my wife in this restaurant, and it hurts to write I haven't been able to come for a few years. However, I have an excuse: my 3.5 year-old daughter. Bohemian is not the kind of place you go with an infant, and I had to wait until the toddler was old enough to behave like a rockstar (with some help from a videogame in my phone and some noise cancellation earphones).  My wife's 40th birthday provided the right opportunity. It's not easy for a restaurant to satisfy such a grand event, but they sure delivered big. This place will never disappoint you. They don't offer the price fix menu anymore, so we ordered a la carte. It wasn't easy, because I would have chosen more than half of the items on the menu. Japanese omelette roll (with egg, grilled eel, uni, chives, mozzarella, parmigiano): OMG. A mouth watering concoction of flavors. You simply must get this. Karaage (Bohemian fried chicken): perfectly prepared, and the house spicy Mayo was phenomenal.Grilled branzino: this is the only item we had last time; delicious, sizable, perfect. Pork belly and foie gras kamameshi (steamed rice with pork belly and burdock topped by foie gras): rich yet smooth; decadent yet delicate; strong yet graceful; simply exquisite. One word about the impeccable service. It's not easy to find a classy restaurant without the pretentiousness that so often comes with it. To the contrary, you can't find a more personable (yet highly professional) staff. Most small restaurants wouldn't have been happy to give away a table for 4 to a couple with a toddler, and understandably so. Instead, we were treated as kings. This is class. Overall... This is THE place you want to bring that someone you want to impress."
3994,Absolutely love this place. One of my favorite places to introduce friends to. Love how exclusive getting a reservation is. Food is always fantastic and so are the drinks. Staff is very friendly.
3995,AMAZING! I've heard great things about this restaurant and was finally able to get a reservation (very hard). The staff is very friendly and I loved my server! It has the Japanese cozy intimate vibe for sure. They also have great sake too. Things I ordered:- Farmer fresh vegetable fondue- Miso Black cod- Mini Bohemian burger- Tuna roll- Porkbelly fried rice- Fried chicken- Bronzino
3996,"Had to opportunity to visit this restaurant via the recommendation of a friend that lives in the area.The concept of having to be invited by pervious guests really pervase a sense of exclusivity. Nonetheless, I was excited to visit this restaurant that I had on my radar long before the pandemic. It should be known that there's no formal sign or even posting about this on the outside of the building. A famous landmark in NoHo, this building is also the site of the Jean-Michel Basquiat Commemorative Plaque. Tucked away in a historical building once home to Andy Warhol and then the live-in studio of Jean-Michel Basquiat, the inimitable graffiti artist from the 80s, Bohemian transpires tastes of new age Japanese influence. Upon arrival you ring the doorbell and are greeted by the host you provide your name as well as the reservation time and you are seated promptly. The space all the small is very intimate there's no traditional seating here with high tables and wooden chairs everything is very relaxed and definitely adds to the ambience. In total I would say there is max 20 people that you could fit into the inside of this restaurant, so I would definitely recommend it as a good quiet place to get dinner. The menu is all QR codes and has a pretty extensive and famous cocktail list. Throughout the night me and my significant other were excited to try new, interesting drink choices. The food is where a lot really comes to life, although there are some traditional Japanese fairs on the menu most of it has some incredible spins that will really wow the palate. Tons of umami flavors, rich tender cuts of meat, an incredibly fresh fish perfectly describe the dining expirence. Our host was extremely attentive and always made sure that we were happy with our dishes. She even took some serious time to go through the menu with us and suggest some must-haves, and new menu items. Cost is what you would expect from a delicious Japanese restaurant in the city, nothing out of the ordinary I would say.All in all, if you're looking for an interesting, intimate, relaxing dinner that will challenge your palate in all the right ways I would highly suggest a night at Bohemian."
3997,"Bohemian is truly a delight! It's a secretive cozy environment with amazing drinks and food. Their cocktails have a Japanese twist to it (personally a big fan of Yuzu so loved they had so many Yuzu cocktails). The food is also delicious. The mushroom risotto is a must -- so fresh and creamy at the same time. Chef's tasting platter meat was so rich and soft didn't even feel like we were eating meat. The grilled branzino had so many different elements to it, no one flavor was the same. PRO TIP: 1. They will ask you for a phone number referral and a card to put down so have it ready 2. It's a bit hard to find but there will be someone to welcome you once you're there!"
3998,"Cozy, intimate Japanese restaurant tucked away in NoHo. It's perfect for those who want a unique dining experience with quality food! The reservation process was quite tricky and seemed a bit intimidating like applying for a job interview. My husband emailed and wrote a small paragraph on why were we interested in dining at the restaurant. The management emailed him back and he had to call back at a specific time frame to make a reservation. We called a little more than a week in advanced to book a table. The restaurant gave off a bit of cozy Japanese speakeasy vibes. It's more suitable for fancy dates or a small party of four or less. The restaurant was tiny but the minimal decor made the place look spacious. The service was excellent and the staff was very attentive. Their cocktails were strong and tasty. They're worth your money! We ordered the vegetable fondue and foie gras nigiri for appetizers. The vegetables were very fresh and crisp as if they were just picked from the garden. The foie gras nigiri was divine! The seared fat just melted into our mouths and lingered in our souls. We also ordered the beef stew with two servings of bread (because we wanted to soak up every last drop of the rich stew). Nothing went to waste! We finished with the uni risotto and the meat platter. Both highly recommended and we were so stuffed! 10/10 Bohemian garden for date nights and small fancy dinners!"
3999,"Farmer's Fresh Vegetable Fondue - 4/5Japanese Wagyu Sushi - 5/55 Kinds of Japanese Mushroom Risotto - 5/5Burdock Pork Belly Foie Gras Kamameshi - 5/5Tasting Platter(Chef's Selection of Daily Meats) with Sea Salt - 5/5Omakase - 4/5Assorted Desserts - 4/5This place is amazing.

4000,"10/10 for service and food here! This restaurant has been on my list for a long time but it used to be super secretive where you needed to know someone to refer you in. Because of covid, they did takeout and allowed for more people to reserve a table. I came on a weeknight and was seated outdoors. We got the yuzu shiso margarita ($17), assorted sashimi ($68), karaage ($17), washu mini beef slider ($13), Uni risotto ($25), and hojicha ice cream ($6). Everything that we got was fantastic and so darn good. But the karaage really stood out so you have to get it!! Best karaage I've had and it's very different from others. It also came with their house special made hot sauce. Nicely fried and very well seasoned with tender chicken meat. The uni risotto was creamy and had a lot of Uni flavor and so finger licking good which I was surprised about. I couldn't stop eating the Uni risotto! The washu mini beef slider was about 4-5 bites but so soft and melt in your mouth good. The drinks are also on point here because my drink was smooth and balanced and just amazing. I would say angel share quality drink. Definitely coming back to try all the other drinks because they all sounded good. The hojicha icecream was a nice dessert to end our meal. I am 100% coming back and I can't wait!"
4001,One of my top 3 restaurants in nyc!! Definitely worth a trip. Everything was impeccable -- from the waitstaff to the presentation to the food to the ambiance
4002,"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and I loved it! It's a very intimate causal setting, it's a speakeasy vibe, no outside sign of the restaurant, you ring a doorbell to notify them you were there. Everything we ordered was tasty and worth the price. If you can get a reservation, definitely go! The sashimi was 10/10 some of the best  Tuna I've had, definitely the best I've had in New York City."
4003,"Unfortunately, we had a pretty disappointing dinner for 2 at Bohemian Restaurant. I think it was more disappointing because we really did want to like the restaurant and the food, for the most part, was delicious. And while the servers were friendly and enthusiastic, I can't say that the service was good. In fact, it took away from the overall experience (note that it is possible there were some errors in the kitchen, but because we were never given a definitive explanation, I can only fault the service).Below are the the timeline of events to illustrate what happened.Our reservation was for 730pm, which we arrived on-time and were seated promptly. When we arrived, about 60% of the tables were full with a couple of large tables still awaiting their guests.Around 745 or so, we put in our drink orders and around 8, we put in our food orders. We ordered a variety of foods that were ""popular"" according to the waitress; she also highly recommended the Wagyu Beef Plate, a recommendation we heeded.Between ~815 and 845, the food started to come out and it was overall well-received. If my recollection is right, we got the cod, beef tartare, mushroom risotto and uni-wagyu sushi. However, this is where the night turned from good to disappointing. At this point, I had already thought the service was a little slow given the delays in ordering, getting drinks out, and just general clearing of plates and refilling water, but I usually give the benefit of the doubt and as mentioned before, the servers were generally very friendly.By 915, we were getting antsy because it was getting late (for a Tuesday) and we still had not gotten our last dish. At 925, I asked the waitress about the dish and inquired whether we could just cancel it. I explicitly remember the time because I remember thinking ""wow, we have already been here for two hours and haven't even gotten the last dish yet"". She said that it had already been started and it would be 10 more minutes. To be honest, at this point, the service could have really locked in a 4 (maybe 5 star) by admitting to their mistake and letting us cancel the order, but it wasn't presented as an option. That's disappointing especially for something that we only ordered because it was highly recommended to us.Finally, the dish came out at 945 (so we've blown past the estimated 10 additional minutes by 10 more minutes). We each took a bite and decided to box it up (perhaps we were already biased because it took so long, but we didn't think it was anything special and frankly, we were just trying to go home at that point) and I asked for the check. We ended up getting the check around 1015, although they probably salvaged an additional star by remembering we were celebrating a birthday and provided us a complimentary ice cream (long story short here is I had forgotten I made this request when I put in the reservation as we had done a surprise party the previous night so it was indeed a pleasant surprise).All in all, given the exclusive reservation system, the price point and the anticipation based on good reviews, we were very disappointed and are unlikely to return. Not to mention, spending about 3 hours at dinner on a Tuesday night again is not really an option! My friend said I should have asked them to comp the last dish, but that's not really our style. I think it would have been a nice gesture from the restaurant but alas, the offer wasn't made (perhaps because of the $120 price point). Because we were seated so close to another couple, I did hear that they cancelled their last dish (because of the delays) so not sure what played into the calculus that allowed them to do so, but not us."
4004,"After been coming here for several years , here is my review for Covid Era which so far I've never given any restaurant/ business for less than 4 stars but this particular experienced kinda pull me off. Food - everything  is on the salty sideThree things that you'd need to be avoided. - Pan Seared Duck is the worse that I've ever had. It was so chewy , I even had to pull a piece out of my mouth because I couldn't chew it. - Steak -  bad as the duck  , they got the temperature right (Medium Rare) , but for 8oz and $100 for the dish I'd say it's pretty much low quality. It is also chewy, and yes I couldn't even chew it at all. - Bohemian Roll - an inside out roll cut into 4 big pieces with yellowtail & salmon topped with ikura & shiso leaf , for $32 under chef's roll selection of the day, where the roll would have been on a regular menu elsewhere but @ Bohemian becomes the ""chef's selection "" . Please avoid at all cost. Been waiting for our server to come by & ask us how's everything but unfortunately not even a word has come out from our server if everything were ok , how was the food ? 1 hour 45 minutes would be more than enough time to eat & enjoy the food IF we wouldn't have to wait for 15 mins for the server to come by to take the order, 30 mins after placed the order for the first app to arrive (45mins been wasted already ) and we've got our last dish @ 7.30pm , and we were rushing out to the door at 7.50pm because the next reservation was waiting. I've acknowledged that the business been struggle & I'm 100% to support since they created an instagram account which they never did, delivery through Caviar , and I even seen some lunch special going on. And my last support was to bring friends for my birthday here even though I have a plenty of choices around New York City. And yeah , not be able to get a cake for a birthday because the server asked if he can give us the check instead of asking if we'd like to get some dessert. (my friends had to take  me to a dessert place nearby to make up my ""birthday cake"" instead)I know that we are running out of our reservation time , but Is there a better way to deal with the issue since the 45 minutes have been wasted for none of the customers fault? I'd like the business to be survived especially during the crazy pandemic, but also to be fair on the customers side to receive reasonable quality of food , service, and experience for the price that they've been paying for. Since no one bothered to ask us how's the things like?  So , I'd just leave my feedback here instead.Hoping my voice is heard."
4005,"Overall experience: 3.5 stars.The raving reviews really got my hopes up, and I'm sad to say my expectations weren't met. Don't get me wrong - the food & cocktails were really good, but considering how much effort you have to put in to get a table and the price-point for some of these dishes... I left a little disappointed, especially since the occasion was to celebrate my partner's birthday. We started with the marinated seared salmon sushi ($20 for 4 pieces) -- No qualms here when it came to quality and cut. Every piece melted in your mouth. The washu beef mini burger ($13/each) had a great flavorful patty, but you can see the buns for yourself... the quality didn't match the patty and it wasn't properly heated so parts of it were cold. The miso black cod ($28) was really soft and flavorful, but nothing about it made it stand out from other Japanese restaurants that offer the same kind of dish, except perhaps the side of *two* shisito peppers and pieces of mushrooms. The star was perhaps the wagyu-beef striploan ($120) with grapefruit salt and wagyu soy. On the one hand, every piece was like a slice of butter - the citrusy salt cut through the grease. But there was still something about it that was lacking. Was it worth  the $120? Eh.When I called to make the reservation, I was told that for birthdays you could order a dessert and they'd be sure to light a candle for your person. During our dinner, I watched a table receive the surprise and was hopeful they had made note of my request because I wanted to surprise my partner. But alas, when our dessert came out, it didn't happen. Bad on me I guess for not sneaking away from my table to remind them. But again, for what this restaurant was supposed to be, I thought I wouldn't have to."
4006,"I've been coming to speakeasy Japanese restaurant Bohemian for over ten years now and it's still my favorite place in NoHo. I'm not kidding when I say that there was a time when we used to come here every month. It's a ""secret"" restaurant, where you won't be able to get reservations unless you have their phone number, but now they are open for online reservations and takeout/delivery for the first time ever. The restaurant is housed inside a building that used to be Andy Warhol's apartment and this is part of the experience. Although this is a Japanese restaurant the food is more Japanese-European fusion than Japanese. They have a tasting menu as well as an a la carte menu. While there will be some dishes from their tasting menu on the a la carte menu, I would highly recommend doing the tasting menu if it's your first time here because it has all of their signature dishes and the tasting menu is really affordable for a restaurant of this quality. The tasting menu usually comes with the vegetable fondue, uni croquet, grilled branzino, beef sashimi, a choice of either the sashimi rice bowl or the washu beef mini burgers, and then the dessert. Everything is amazing and you seriously can't go wrong with ordering anything off their menu even if you decide to do the a la carte. Due to COVID19 indoor dining is prohibited in New York until further notice so while you can still do takeout or delivery from Bohemian, you'll have to wait to do the tasting menu until they reopen for indoor dining, but hopefully this will give you something to look forward to!"
4007,Second time going to Bohemian and food was just as amazing as my first time! We ordered a bunch of food to share for the table instead of doing the tasting menu. The highlight was the wagu tartar and risotto - delicious! We also all got the wagu burger which was good but was lacking compared to the wagu tartar. We all had a round of cocktails (nice and creative selection) then asked the waiter for his suggestions for a sake to share (picture attached). Very nice sake which opened up as a dry to medium body and finished more on the medium side as it aired. Good for sharing amongst a varied pallet. Very COVID compliant with a good amount of space between tables. Only compliant is that they added a 10% COVID relief charge - which I think is tasteless (they should just increase prices). Overall we are definitely coming back for a third time!
4008,"My wife made us reservations here for my birthday. We experienced phenomenal food and the service was very personal, Our server kept us informed about every dish. You won't go wrong on anything you order but the Wagyu beef it something I cannot describe. The environment was very relaxed, intimate and comfortable. The price was well worth the experience; To think Basquiat & Warhol were once there makes it truly special."
4009,"I've been here a few times, and it's safe to say that this is one of my favorite restaurants in nyc.Hard to find from the street because of its speakeasy nature, but once you're in, you transcend to a wonderful dining experience. The atmosphere is warm yet calm and feels like you're sitting with friends around their living room. The seating is very comfortable and decor is classic with a modern twist.There is a great cocktail menu along with a decent wine list. Food is absolutely phenomenal and you cannot go wrong ordering anything on the menu.Will be back again (and again and again)"
4010,"Love getting my shake shack fix! The double cheeseburger was oily, salty, juicy but nonetheless delicious. The buns were a bit soggy though. The fries were crispy.Although the restaurant was packed, the service was fast. There is not many tables/seats  considering the number of people that eat there every day."
4011,"So boom. The squad and me got the munchies. We outside. Working. Serving customers. Slappin' babies. Block going crazy. It's 84 degrees, breezy. 3 pigeons with peg legs knife fighting over some bread crumbs, two homeless people bumpin' uglies in the bushes....life is good. Serene. This is picturesque NYC. Anyway. We hungry. It's Sunday so we can't order from where we want to order - Chick-fil-A. Apparently Jesus didn't want people making chicken on Sundays, so they don't be serving fiends on Sunday. Idk man. I'm not a theologian or anything but I'm pretty sure Jesus didn't die for my sins just for me to starve. I wasn't at the last supper, so, I'm still trying to eat, nah mean? So we order. & if you know me then you know I be shoveling hella nuggs in my mouth. The more nuggs the merrier. Tonguing them shts down crazy. If you also know me, I'm forever with that slurp slurp. I'm on my Kelis sht daily. Sucky sucking them milkshakes down no problemo my guy. So, I order me some Hot Honey Nuggets and a Chocolate Birthday Cake Shake. It's a new shake. Gotta try it. They don't have that triple chocolate brownie joint anymore, so I need to try an alternative. So, we order through UberEats and for the first time ever, the Shake Shack order got here double time. I'm excited. I've had the Hot Homey nuggs before so I know them joints will be *okay* but I'm really looking forward to the milkshake. MANNNNNNNNNNNNNNN. What in the hell did I ever do to y'all for you to disrespect me like this? I'm legitimately a nice mf and y'all just violated me crazy. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. Look at the attached picture. WHO TF THREW KETCHUP PACKETS IN MY MILKSHAKE!?!?!?? On Buddha, it's on sight bro. Who did this to me? Did you think it was a sprinkle? Did someone stuff ketchup packets in the whipped cream can? Was y'all just horsing around in the kitchen and one of y'all Kobe'd two ketchup packets from half court? Y'all practicing for NBA 2K22? I just really don't understand it. Is this some type of collaboration I just wasn't aware of? McDonalds got the Travis Scott Meal, Saweetie 'N Sour Sauce, and a broken McFlurry machine. Shake Shack got......KETCHUP PACKETS YEETED INTO MY MF MILKSHAKE?! Unacceptable. Ya'll need to get it together. Huddle up. Have a team meeting. Y'all gotta ensure the public that such an atrocity will never happen again. I'm about to cancel y'all on Twitter. Boycott y'all. I need to see some resignations happening in the next couple weeks. If you love milkshakes as much as I do, then you'll see this as a legitimate hate crime. Two stars cause the nuggs be aiight."
4012,"was good! wasn't the best! the flavors didn't combine well! the shake was good, but i can honestly say steak & shake is better."
4013,"Ah Shake shack - NYC's favorite hangover food. OK wasn't too hungover but came to the Shack at ~1130pm on a Wednesday for a late night bite. Our group got the double shackburger with regular fries since we were around the area and wanted a quick bite. PROS: Shackburger was juicy as you expected! The double patties does wonders, the sauce on top of the lightly toasted potato buns were a great combination of tangy-ness, sauciness, meat juices, and crispy buns. Fries were made very crispy and salted to the right level. Definitely Shake Shack consistently delivers on the quality of their products wherever you go. CONS: This Shake Shack was pretty dirty. There was trash on a lot of these tables and not enough staff around to clean it up. Some spilling of soda/beer here and there. I guess most of these customers should learn how to behave and clean up after their mess to - so there's two parties that are partially at fault here. Lines were pretty long as we waited about 15 minutes for ""fast food."" This Shack was also pretty congested and crowded so they may want to consider redesigning their floor to accomodate more customers or perhaps set up an outdoor seating area as well. OVERALL:Still a great spot for a quick fix up. Just don't expect it to be the quickest or cleanest Shake Shack in this city."
4014,"[Intro Disclaimer: As a Toronto foodie, I ventured out to New York for the first time in my life with high expectations and a fully planned itinerary dedicated towards trying all the best foods in New York City!]For us Canadians, I think there's an unspoken rule that when visiting NY, eating at Shake Shack is a must. And so, I did the first night I arrived, right after watching the Kinky Boots musical! Talk about a great night, right? Seemingly crowded at every hour of every day, this Shake Shack location was especially busy when I came around 9:30pm because of the rush from post-musicals in the area. Despite this, it seemed they had anticipated for the rush and were adequately prepared to serve the massive line up. The wait was minimal and I was pleasantly surprised by how fast we got our food. Seating was a bit difficult to find but since it's a fast food joint, the turnover of standing tables was relatively fast. The burger was good. That's what I'll give it. Not the most delicious burger of life but definitely a GOOD fast food burger. Not too greasy, not too salty, the meat was meaty, the lettuce was green, and the tomatoes were red. It was everything you'd expect a burger to be! At first, I thought the price point was a bit higher than normal but now in retrospect thinking about all the food in Manhattan, I'd say it was actually reasonably affordable. Though I wouldn't crave it, for sure I'd come back if I was in the mood for fast food and the alternative was McDs!"
4015,"My son said Shake Shack has the best burgers of all the chains.  I don't know about that but we both enjoyed our double shack burgers tonight.  This is a busy location so it does take a bit of a wait to get your meal.Servers were all very nice and the place was clean.  I admit, the double shack burger was good, maybe not the best burger but it hit the spot."
4016,"I'm sure their food is great, but unfortunately it sat on a shelf behind the counter for 24 minutes. I asked two employees for help over the course of 30 mins and they said it was coming. After 30 mins they realized it was sitting on a shelf and blamed me for not checking. Behind the counter? I had another order for my sister and hers was ordered and picked up at the scheduled time - which was the exact same time as mine. Both orders were cold and soggy by the time the employees realized the mistake and neither order was edible. Ten minutes before the employees realized My food was misplaced, I tried to call customer service to explain that they lost my order and the 1+ hour line was too long for me to find a manager, I tried tk call the help line. shake shack does not offer customer service via phone and the only option is  told me to leave a voicemail.  I spent $65 dollars for food for my family and figured a burger was a simple easy option, but my first time at shake shack really sucked."
4017,Oh yum!! Finally got to try Shake Shack in New York and it did not disappoint. The staff was really friendly and pretty quick with their service. The place was really crowded during dinner time but was still able to place order pretty quickly. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because there was no seating. We had to stand and eat but it's honestly not their fault. It was during busy hours which shows this place is definitely a must while in New York!!! Def coming back again before vacation is over.
4018,"I walked two blocks here from our hotel in 10th. I hadn't had Shake Shack for about 2 years before this time. I was CRAVING it and had to come before I left town.It was very busy, as expected. The line almost scared me away but I ordered within 10 minutes of waiting. They had several different order lines and some lines only accepted cards (which worked in my favor)I ordered a burger and fries to go. I figured after a long day of walking I could take it back to my hotel to relax and eat in peace. The only seating available at the restaurant were community standing tables.Service was fast for how busy they were and I was in and out within 30 minutes.I happily walked back to the hotel and indulged!"
4019,"Finally got to the states and tried out Shake Shack. Had the classic burger, whatever it is called, and it was delicious. The patty tastes like home grilled which I loved. Next time will try out a shake!"
4020,"Hmm.... I am really not sure what is so special about Shake Shack.... I liked how there was wider variety of selection when it came to burgers than In n out, and how you can really taste the cheese in the burger, but then buns were a bit soggy. I also got the black and white milkshake, which did not have a high quality milkshake flavor. I know they are building Shake Shack all around the world now, and it's no longer just NY thing, but I don't think I will go to another store for these burgers. Also, it is really hard to find a seat in this restaurant, just fyi!"
4021,"The Shroom Burger I had was awesome but the fries were just average. The place was packed when I went there and the restaurant inside was beautiful.Even though it was packed I was able to place my order in 20 minutes and had to wait about another 10 to 15 minutes to receive it. The restaurant was clean. The food was hot and the service was wonderful, and the shroom burger was one of the best burgers I have tasted. I didn't even miss the burger inside."
4022,"I am already a fan of Shake Shack's burgers and fries. I never really visited this location until COVID began though. I am really impressed with how their staff has handled the pandemic. Plastic barriers at the register, temperature-checking for all customers when they walk in (even if you are just doing pickup), hand sanitizer stations, clear signage that encourages social distancing now that limited dine-in eating is happening. But what really stands out is this: some customers came in without masks and tried to order food. An employee immediately came out with 2 surgical masks and encouraged the customers to wear them (I think she said, ""You look good, but I really need you to wear these""). When they put them on wrong (ie, below their mouths -- c'mon people!) and went to sit down, a manager came out and told them they'd have to leave with their food if they did not adhere to mask-wearing properly. The couple fixed their masks.It is a really stressful time for the service industry, even more when those employees are asked to also enforce safety protocols. Bravo for this location for de-escalating what could have been a tense encounter, and continuing to make it safe for all their customers during COVID."
4023,The new black sugar shake is excellent! And the person working at the register right now was the best! So kind and really made my day
4024,Stopped by while I was out and about during work. As soon as I walked in my temperature was checked (crazy that's a thing now). Ordered my usual smokehouse double with cheese fries and black/white milkshake. Order came up fast and correct and the order taker was extremely friendly.
4025,"Ahhhh....NYC, where the great Shake Shack originates from.  This location isn't hard to find as its located on a busy main street with big bright flashing lights.  We had just arrived in Manhattan and were starving.  It was almost 11 pm and were still stuck on Cali time.  We decided to Yelp some places with in the vicinity of our hotel and Shake Shack popped up.  SCORE!   They're open until 12 am.  Yesss!  As we entered the establishment, we were kindly greeted by the staff.  The place itself is not too big.  You stand in line, order your food and are sent off with a pager.  Once paged, you pick up your food.  This location is very busy so it's kind of hard to find seating.  I ordered the Chic'n Shack which is a fried to crisp chicken breast with lettuce, pickles and buttermilk mayo.   It's simple, not overpowered with all kinds of toppings and condiments which is how I usually like my sandwiches and burgers but this....THIS was simply DELICIOUS!  The sandwich itself isn't too big.  I kind of wish I ordered two.  Same with the Hubby.  He ordered the Double Shack Burger and found it fairly small.  I tried his burger and thought it was pretty good but honestly I'm more of a poultry gal so of course the Chic'n Shack got my vote.  We also shared an order of fries.  The fries are crinkle cut and crispy.  For dessert, I ordered a cup of vanilla custard.  I absolutely love their custard!  I could binge on a gallon of that stuff.  It's great!"
4026,"In the heart of Times Square on 8th. Being a west coaster, I had to check out all the fuss about shake shack. Too crowded to sit, so I ordered to go. Crinkle cut fries and soft potato bun  are the stars of the show. Burger is good, but not spectacular. Walk a bit more down Hell's Kitchen, pay five dollars more and have a meal experience at King of Kobe."
4027,Always my go to burger spot! You definitely get what you pay for meaning it's not the best burger but it's definitely a I don't wanna spend too much money but want a good burger type of burger (if that makes sense). I always go for the shack burger which is super flavorful and the chicken burger which is honestly amazing. I personally think the chicken burger tastes better just because the chicken is crispy and it has more spice to it.
4028,"Love this Shake Shack! Service was exceptional here. Staff was very attentive and friendly. Food service was quick and quality was great. Staff made sure we were enjoying meals and were quick to clean/take away our finished trays. Being close to Time Square, this place gets quite busy but I'd say it has a fair amount of seating. People are constantly in and out quick and plus there's two large hight tables to stand and eat. Additionally, security guards the exit door to this location! I love Shake Shack for their Shroom burger and cheese fries! The burger is deep fried oozing in cheese and mushroom and cheese fries have a really rich and creamy cheese flavour."
4029,So third stop to find something to eat last Saturday. Was not a line to get in. Tad bit of a wait for the food. But seating was insane. So hard to find a table. Even at te standing tables it was tough getting a spot. But hey feel people don't realize your in the city. Have to eat and go. Not the best to eat and just sit and relax when your done. Let other people sit. But the food is always good. Love there orange Creamsicle shake.
4030,"I came on a Monday night and surprisingly there was no wait. I ordered the ShackBurger and it tastes like what you would expect, a cheese burger. The potato buns were fluffy and tasted a bit sweet. The patty is cooked to medium and pretty soft, but I still prefer in-n-out burgers. I ordered the cookies and creme chocolate shake. Surprisingly, the shake was not too sweet and I was able to finish it. I feel like the shakes here are what makes this chain unique."
4031,"This Shake Shack location is super busy! Our hotel was just across the street at The Row and decided to come here around 8pm for dinner. There are several massively long lines going and cashiers are taking orders at fast-paced speed and at high volume! We ordered a double cheeseburger, fried chicken burger, fries, a strawberry milkshake and a coke. The cashier entered in vanilla shake and I corrected her and she made the correction. What I received in the end was still a vanilla shake but I was back at the hotel so I just ended up drinking it. After you order, you go in another line for pick up. Food was good for fast food. Sometimes you just want a quick, juicy, fast food burger and you got Shake Shack! They are actually opening up various locations out here in the Bay Area so I will be back."
4032,"This is probably one of my favorite burger joints. When we went in, the line wasn't too long to order and we waited about 15 minutes for the food to come out. Since it was my first time here, I expected the burgers to be somewhat more presentable than how they looked when they brought them to us. Most of the things that were supposed to be inside the buns (patty, lettuce, tomatoes) were coming out so it was hard to eat. Also, we asked for extra shack sauce on the side and we were given a tiny sample barely enough to dip a couple of french fries in. However, the four stars are for the taste of the burger. This location is extremely packed, so we definitely had to wait a while for a group to leave so we can take their table. I will be back for the shack burger, but most likely at other locations."
4033,"The only reason Shake Shack doesn't get 5 stars is because it is so hard to find table space to eat inside. When I come to NY, I have to have my ""Shake Stack"" fix. The portobello mushroom with the cheese oozing out of it along with a meat burger. The best burger ever!  Had a side of cheese fries that hit the spot!"
4034,"When I think of Shake Shack, I think of burgers on a scale of restaurant quality. I was so excited to try Shake shack but ultimately I was disappointed. Shake Shack to me, is on a level of food better than fast food but you still prefer the fast food. The service was rushed but I let that pass because it was busy and the cashiers have jobs to do, also there is no waiter service so I wasn't expecting amazing service.  They have a minimum selection of burgers which I feel are overpriced and you have to get fries and drink separate which makes the food more overpriced than it's worth. I got the Bacon Burger and my girlfriend got the Shack Burger. We didn't wait long for our food considering the line but it wasn't very hot. There was nothing that truly stood out to me about the burger or fries. The food was pretty bland. I've had better food from cheaper places and that says something I don't know, I may give Shake Shack another chance in Atlanta and see if there is a difference, but who knows. Maybe my expectations were too high. Our total: 2 burgers, a order of fries and a small drink was 30 dollars"
4035,"I love the burgers at shake shack! This place is forever crowded with long lines, probably because it is in Times Square area. We came here around 1030pm and there was still a line though it didn't snake out of the door like in the afternoon. It took a while to find a table as it was just packed with diners. I had just the smoke shack burger since it was late and I didn't go overboard with ordering the whole works. The smokeshack burger was so good with applewood smoked bacon and chopped cherry pepper. It was also spicy from the pepper which took me by surprise. It made a perfect light night snack. I also tried my friend's salted caramel shake which was so thick. It was good too. You can't go wrong with a made to order juicy burger here."
4036,"Ah yes, the infamous New York City Shake Shack. This will be the second location in New York that I've had a chance to eat at, and the third location I have had a chance to visit. This location was interesting. Being a block or so from Times Square, there was a constant line out the door. We decided to come during an off hour to make sure we avoided that line. Thankfully, that meant we were in a line but only indoors.  We were able to commandeer a booth and squeezed five of us in. We ordered 5 burgers and some fries, as well as a beer and a coffee shake to distribute.I was not a fan of the ridiculous wait for my beer. She had a terrible time trying to pour an entire pint of beer into a plastic cup. It LITERALLY took 10 minutes. I stood there while I watched her pour ounces and ounces of beer foam down the drain as she frantically tried to fill the cup with liquid. Yikes. That was unpleasant. My Chicken shack was unfortunately not Insta-worthy. However, it was still tasty. Everyone was satisfied with their burgers without being overly full, which is a success, in my book. Just don't get a beer here - for your sake, the sake of the people waiting in line behind you, and for the poor people behind the counter who don't know how to pour a beer."
4037,"Visited here a couple times during our trip. I've tried their Shroom Burger, Shack Burger and chocolate milkshake.After you receive your order, go find a seat. It's a very popular spot, so finding one can be daunting. They have booths available and also tall tables where you can stand while eating. Snagging a booth can be difficult as lots of other people are trying to get seats too so you have to be aggressive when trying to claim a table. I was a bit disappointed with the shroom burger, mainly because I misread the menu description. I thought it was going to be a beef burger with a portobello mushroom. It wasn't until after I received the order I realized the portobello mushroom was in place of the burger. The chocolate shake was ok -- a normal chocolate shake. During our next visit I did try their Shack Burger which was good. I liked the sauce it came with. Oh and their bacon cheese fries are a must!"
4038,"I had the mango habanero nuggets and that sauce is an acquired taste. This was my first time having Shake Shack, so I would recommend not getting what I got if this is a first for you. At this location the staff was friendly and got my food pretty quick even though they were packed."
4039,"I don't get it. What makes this place so great? I thought the burger tasted like McDonalds. I had to get up, and wade through the waiting crowd TWICE to get anything resembling warm French Fries. The Burger was anemic. Really. I was expecting a big juicy burger, from all the hype.I don't see why anyone would wait on line for such a blah-nuthin' burger.Then there was this ""Hunger Games-esque"" competition for tables... ""are you leaving soon?"" ""Are you sitting there?"" ""Is that seat open, can I take that chair?"" Yikes!The shake, at least, was good. Get one of those .... to go."
4040,"What a wonderful discovery of the year so far!!! I am not fond of chain restaurants and gyu kaku changed my mind!Went for lunch special which is a GREAT DEAL!! For bbq you can chose a set of miso soup, salad and 2 or 3 meats plus rice for a great deal. I did 3 meats for $20 and SUPERB!Meat was so tasty and tender. Sososososo good!!Service is fast and nice. Pretty attentive.Place is clean and going with a stroller they were very accommodating."
4041,"**came here one friday night, we had a reservation. when we arrived hostess said it would be small wait. that wait turned into about 10-12mins. and the small waiting area got packed. once we were seated i could tell this place was a good spot. it was my first time at a place like this where u cook ur own food. my dinning partner had been here once before. we ordered cocktails: coco mo & mango tango (both good and tasty). then we ordered steak, shrimp and chicken. they had about 4 sauces u could dip ur meat in and instructions on how to cook the food for. i was all good. {{sorry no pics of food cooked, i had video and u cant upload vids yet.}}this was a cool experience for me that i think id try again & again. if ur in the soho area, id say definitely stop in and get u a piece. i most definitely will be backsigned,i love to eat and i do out consistently mr.von teese and companyxoxox"
4042,"There are multiple locations in the city, but I've been coming to this one for years. We went as a party of two and were seated right after having our vaccination cards checked. Maybe because we were two people or because there was a snowstorm outside. We went for the meat lovers course ($85). Since it was happy hour, we also got side plates, including the gyu-sushi (2.5/5) and spicy shrimp (4.5/5). The sushi was essentially two pieces of roast beef and rice. There was nothing super fancy or special about it. Meanwhile, I loved the spicy shrimp. It was pretty spicy, but the spice level was SOOO on par with my taste. But best of all, we got the harami in secret pot, which is a must-get for me every single time. We did most of the cooking, well I personally didn't! But, the server did switch the plate several times during our meal. We enjoyed our meal and were glad we didn't order more! This place is worth trying if you want to try various cuts and small dishes. There is also a selection of drinks, including their signature cocktails that are also part of their happy hour menu."
4043,"Gyu-Kaku is always a good place to get some BBQ in the city. There are about 2 or 3 locations in Manhattan. The reason I love coming here is that they have a large selection of meats and items. The best part is that they have happy hours from the time they open to 5pm. This includes some of their food items as well as drinks!My boyfriend and I usually get the chef's favorite (serves 2); it comes with miso soup, beef sukiyaki bibimbap, gyu-sushi, kimchi, salad, prime kalbi short rib, skirt steak, filet mignon, ribeye, pork belly, garlic shrimp and broccoli with cheese. Sounds like a lot right? I mean...kinda in that it's a lot of different items but the portions are not that big when it came to the amount of meat that is given. Don't expect to get a pile of meat for each of the bbq items. It's enough if you're a small eater but for my boyfriend and I, we always order MORE food items on the sides, like (our favorite) the spicy tuna volcano, takoyaki, the tuna poke nachos...w/e we are feeling that day. Anyways, the meats are pretty good and tender. You wouldn't ever get served any distasteful ones. My fave bbq meat items were the harami skirt steak and kalbi short rib since they are marinated in sweet soy or miso. So they are very flavorful and would pair great with some plain white rice. But they have brown rice you can order OR have the sukiyaki bibimbap that you get with the chef's favorite. The items always come in a timely manner and the waiters would always let you know exactly how long to cook each meat for. You better listen to if you want the meat to be cooked well...unless you like it burnt and overcooked. ( To each his own tho...). The waiters are always attentive and you can always ask them for assistance. The reason I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 is due to the location. I noticed that each location is a little different. Not sure if it's just me (and my boyfriend) but we noticed in some locations the portion looks a little big smaller?  We are fatasses so maybe we are complaining too much lol . Another thing is that you don't have to worry about smelling like you were sitting in a BBQ place the whole day. They have a system that you do not smell once you enjoyed your meal!! This is great cause like yeah I like BBQ as much as the next person but...I don't want to smell like BBQ...on my way home...on the public transportation! esp. my hair"
4044,"Definitely download the app and make a reservation ahead of time and earn points to get a discount/free item. People who didn't have one were waiting up to an hr. The only thing is the front of the restaurant is pretty narrow so all of the people were crowded waiting there. However, the back is pretty spacious and the tables are far enough that you have privacy gobbling down on your meats. This was my first time having japanese bbq and everything was delicious. We go the meat lovers special and all of the meat was really well marinated that I didn't need any of the sauces. The servers were so attentive in answering questions and changing the grills constantly. I also loved how crispy the karage and how savory the mushrooms I got were. I would definitely come back to this location again!"
4045,"I came here on Black Friday with some Friends for the lunch special. The wait time was not long, so we were seated very quickly! We decided to order the lunch special and some meat to share. The meat needs to be cooked on our own so its not done by the waiter/waitress.  Service: The service is average/good, but wish they give more water. It did take a while for them to switch out the plate when we were barbecuing, so we were using the same plate which made the meat more burnt.Food: I got the Roast Beef Gyu-Don Set that comes with Miso Soup, Lunch Salad, Edamame, and of course the Gyu-don. Be aware that the Roast Beef Gyu-don that my friend and I had was cold so we ended up putting it int he grill ourselves. I think it suppose to be cold, but not really sure. Overall it was still good and a nice place to have a bonding meal with friends and family.Overall: I will come back here if I ever want some japanese BBQ. They have a mobile phone to collect points for ever meal so its not bad honestly."
4046,"My friend and I came to Gyu-Kaku for happy hours and some small plates. She is actually went to another location for BBQ before and she said they were pretty good. We sat at the bar because all table wasn't available yet. I had signature frozen red sangria: refreshing and so delicious. We had a great time talking, drinking and eating.Because we sat at the bar and only one bartender was working at that time so we waited long to order food and drinks."
4047,"My favorite place to go for JBBQ! I love that we are able to cook ourselves as part of the experience and eat good quality meat as well. Their lunch special deal is my favorite because it comes with soup, salad, and rice with options to upgrade if you would like specialty cuts that are not included in their lunch menu options. Their happy hour is also everyday and starts at opening so I would also take advantage of that if you want some drinks! I would also highly recommend downloading their app to collect points and get freebies when you redeem your points!"
4048,"This place, where should I start. Great crowds of people, very lively, nice service but way overpriced for food. Great happy hour discount on drinks if you're a drinker though. Now the problem is the portions and the leftover looking pieces of beef, chicken etc that they serve you. It was extremely thin and looked like left over scraps clinged with only fat but charging you almost 20 a plate. Big NO for me. Spent over 150+ on junk."
4049,"Might be a chain, but the quality and consistency are there, so I'm a fan! The prices are good, the staff is friendly, and the tables are well spaced. They have good deals you can take advantage on via the app as well. The combos can be worth it depending on what you're looking for, but we usually get individual items because we're not interested in the rice, miso soup, etc. Everything is well seasoned and you get to cook it yourself! Because of COVID a lot of kbbq places cook it for you which I don't really like; half the reason I'm there is the joy of cooking and taking time to talk with table mates-- so I love that at Gyu-Kaku you still get to grill the food yourself. Highly recommend! :)"
4050,"I don't usually give 5 stars to a restaurant but this place deserves it. The meat I had here was some of the most flavorful and juicy meat I've ever had. I went with 3 of my friends and we decided to get the Ninja course which is said to be for 3 people but I found that it was enough for the 4 of us. It was very affordable and I thought it was a good price for the amount of meat we ate. The ambiance is great and the servers are so nice and helpful. 10/10 recommend, you must try this place!"
4051,"Came here with a party of 5, ordered the Shogun BBQ set for 6 people. Came hungry, left full. We had a reservation but ended up waiting around 20 mins to get seated.  We got seated at a booth towards the end near the bathroom. The location made it more quiet and more intimate. Dinner service was standard overall.  Beef Sukiyaki Bibimbap ~ Good flavors.  Fried Pork Gyoza Dumpling ~ Nice and crispyMeats~ A okay except the Shrimp Garlic, that was too salty. Way too generous with the salt.Con - Cant substitute S'mores  for dessert, I wish we could have picked or gotten something else. Not a huge fan of s'mores, but its a fun group activity. I felt like they needed something else at the end to cleanse all the oil & grease.  Price wise, felt like we would have normally have paid at ayce bbq"
4052,"I haven't been here in a while but it's always a nice treat to go to Gyu-Kaku from time to time. It's definitely a nice family spot or even a date spot with your SO. The meat is always fresh, and they added some new things to the menu since the last time I came. Their spicy sauce is really tasty and adds extra flavor to everything (it's not that spicy though). The menu is extensive and varied so there is something for everyone. In terms of pricing, things can rack up fast. I found something blue.. like a part of a rubber band in my spicy tuna volcano so that was a bit off putting but all in all, it's a great spot."
4053,"Came here for lunch on Sunday and it wasn't too busy before 1 pm. We arrived at 12:30 and were able to get seated right after. For 2 girls, we ordered 3 meats, 1 full salad, and 1 noodle. We think that it was just the right amount of food! The garlic shrimp noodle was really good! The noodles are thick and chewy and the flavor was great. The meats were just okay, maybe because we don't really know how to barbecue it."
4054,"Great service and great experience! Made it just in time for happy hour and I'm so glad I did. I ordered a few drinks to accompany my meal. I recommend the vodka strawberry lemonade, Coco-Mo, and the Mango Mai-Tai.For the main meal, we ordered the special Yaki-Shabu tower and a few other meats and it was all really yummy! If you like a sweet and savory marinade, definitely give the Yaki Shabu beef a try. See if you can conquer the mountain because I couldn't :( but maybe next time I can!"
4055,"It was nice to come here for a change of experience but coming back, probably not. Came here for a small family dinner (4 people including myself) and made a reservation prior for 7 pm on a Friday.Took a while to be seated even after everybody arrived on time so I would suggest arriving earlier than reservation time.We ordered a whole bunch of items from the a la carte menu because having a choice is nice. The meats arrived a couple of plates at a time; however, they were unidentifiable most of the time, so I can't recall my feels for each item we ordered. Would be nice if there was a way to identify what each plate is being served.I do remember I really enjoyed the Yaki-Shabu beef and the beef tongue was a family favorite.  Didn't really enjoy the thick cuts because we didn't know how long to cook it for and wouldn't recommend getting pork belly or chicken meat here. Most of the meats came marinated so they were good to eat once grilled but there were 2 sauces provided to dip the meats into. The slice of lemon really boosts flavor too!It would be nice if they offered more selections to help balance all the meatiness and grease. We ordered 1 Garlic Shio Cabbage thinking it would a light side dish but boy that was drenched in this garlicky, salty dressing. We ended up washing it with water twice to dilute the flavor. Also ordered shishito peppers which were eh, edamame beans, and rice on the side. It was fun to grill the meats on our own and the servers changed our grills a few times throughout our dining experience. It was also easy to flag a server despite how busy the restaurant was.But the pricy bill and the limited menu selection are the main two factors that deter me from coming back again."
4056,"One of my favorite places, both pre-Covid and now! Reservation only, and they do temperature checks and contact tracing. I've always loved their happy hour on both food and drinks, and it's always a great experience to bring new people to. Sometimes people think wow I have to cook my own food but they then love it haha. I usually get a garlic chicken noodle or rice, an app or two and then a bunch of orders of meat to grill.  Most recently they are having a yakishabu mountain - 2 lbs of yakishabu for $31-36. My favorite cut for an amazing price! This can definitely feed 4-5 adults along with 1-2 apps. I came with my friends and her two kids and could barely finish but we made it through!"
4057,"I heard so many great reviews about Guy-Kaku, so while on vacation in NYC, it was a must to for dinner.  And I am so glad I did!  The atmosphere, the vast selection and the food, together made this a wonderful experience."
4058,"Gyu-Kaku is probably the largest bbq Japanese restaurant chain in the US. I made a reservation at their East Village, opening. With 35% restaurant capacity, we were comfortable with how they spaced the customers throughout the restaurant and there is temperature taking and contact tracing before they let you in.We were presented with a long front and back menu of ala carte BBQ courses, many different kinds of protein to choose from, different kinds of beef cuts, etc. but our eyes caught Chef's Favorite, a $90 dinner package that serves 2 people and it came with the following:*Miso soup*Fried Gyoza*Gyu-kaku salad*Napa kimchi*Beef sukiyaki bibimbapall five appetizers came almost all at once but we decided to hold off with Bibimbap and eat that together with bbq meat. They then started firing up the smokeless bbq stove mantled in front of our table, for the meat there are few alterations of meat (prime kalbi short ribs, pork belly, garlic shio cabbage are unavailable that night) we instead got chicken teriyaki.*Harami skirt steak *Filet mignon *Shrimp garlic*Chicken teriyaki *Broccoli with cheese*Garlic chicken which is also not in the selection We then concluded our dinner with green tea crepe cake. Though we did not get many items on the package, it did not detract from the whole experience, I'm still going to take back a star for that!If you haven't yet, Gyu-Kaku is a great place for dinner, celebration, and even date night. Good food, great customer service, odor, and smoke-less bbq joint, it's a must-try."
4059,Came here for a birthday celebration and enjoyed it overall. I had expected that the servers would cook the meat for us but maybe that is not how this restaurant does it. It's challenging to time the cook time of the meat yourself and I would have wanted someone to help us out. The meat was delicious. We got a la carte meat instead of the set which we preferred since we didn't really want to eat the side dishes Not bad but not my favorite
4060,"Overpriced and mediocre. Their special courses for set groups of people are designed to be full of appetizers that fill you up, while being light on meat. The amount of meat might seem like a lot (9 different plates), but it's really 1 tiny piece of meat per person per plate. Each serving of raw meat had 4 pieces for our 4-person course.The meat tasted fine, but there was a plethora of appetizers, and they were mostly subpar. The karaage would not pass in any other Japanese restaurant, it was embarrassingly bad. Tiny pieces that are fried unlike any karaage you've ever seen before. The spicy tuna volcano was an odd mess to me, and the gyu-sushi was like roast beef on rice that crumbles apart thanks to the sauce. I see why people would like some of these, but it's disappointing such mediocre food padded out the dinner. I would be totally okay with the smaller grilled meat portions if these appetizers were actually enjoyable."
4061,"a great place to have bbq The environment is very like Japanese izakaya. The staff is very nice.The bbq food is good, especially the beef! I really like the beef and duck breast, while the pork is soso.The sukiyaki rice taste good but not contain many beef inside. The ramen is ok but the noodles is instant noodle I guess.My favorite besides bbq is the lady M cake. I eat it three years ago in nyc and no expect to eat it again in a bbq restaurant! It was soo great and delicious. Other dessert is fabulous too, eg cotton candy. will come again：）"
4062,"I came in with my boyfriend for dinner. We didn't have a reservation and had to wait 30 minutes to get seated, which we were fine with. Food and service was decent. However, DO NOT GET THE SMORES. The chocolate is stored in an open container and there were SO MANY FLIES ON THE CHOCOLATE!!! I'm pretty sure all the staff knew because they were serving smores to many people throughout the night and had to have seen the flies on the chocolate, but didn't do anything. Probably served the chocolate knowing they were covered in flies. The chocolate was teeming with them. Seeing that, who knows how they take care of their other food."
4063,"Always a great experience. The flavors in the meat + you grill, they have already been beautifully set.. You just execute!"
4064,"Absolutely loved this place! The Happy Hour prices are such a steal (50% off the cocktails, so some are even just $5). As for the food, it does get pretty pricey, but it's worth a little splurge for a special occasion or with a group. They have nice packages for groups; we had the combo for six people, and it came with a wide variety of ingredients. The meats were all so tender and marinated well, and the fried rice was AMAZING."
4065,"This is my favorite Japanese bbq spot that has good happy hour! They used to have better happy hour but now the meats are about $1-$2 off their regular menu. The drinks are still good happy hour though! They are about half price off. Right now their happy hour ends at 6pm on weekdays. They also have a rewards program and you can scan the receipt to get the points added. Usually I order different meats but if I'm in a group we usually go for the sets they have which is definitely enough food! They have sets for 4 people, 5 people, and larger sets for 8 people. They also have a bunch of appetizers that are all amazing! You order the meats and then the servers bring it out and tell you how long to cook each side for. They also provide tongs so you can grill yourself which is the fun part of coming here. The drinks are great here. I got the mango tango and it was fruity but you can definitely taste the alcohol in it. Great spot for good food and drinks with friends!"
4066,Japanese BBQ was outstanding. We spent the extra $65 for the kobe beef selection. Plus we did a feed a family 4 off the menu selections. Highly recommend this choice.
4067,"Made a reservation and when i got there they led y group straight to the table. We ordered the Yakiniku preset for 4 people. Everything came on time, the drinks tasted amazing and all the food was perfectly seasoned! The staff were great, all polite and very committed to making customers happy! I recommend everyone goes i will definitely be going again"
4068,"Definitely a cool spot to check out! We've never tried Japanese BBQ before but it was a great way of stuffing ourselves full! :) They try to get you with the prepackaged sets but we felt like it was waaaaayyy too much food, so we ordered a la carte instead and saved some $$$ :)"
4069,"Came here for my birthday dinner. Had the chefs recommended set for $90Overall subpar experience for Japanese barbecue, much much better value for money in my opinion in New York CityService was very average. Didn't have anything to drink or eat on our table while waiter was incredibly unattentive most of the nightGo to cote"
4070,"Came here for my anniversary, and loved every aspect of this quaint yet fun restaurant. From the candlelit table, brick interior, and spectacular service, to the delicious pasta and lively wine cellar, I'm already missing my experience here. We came here around 9pm on a Friday night and were seated quickly. Since we were celebrating our anniversary, we were pleasantly surprised to receive Prosecco on the house. For appetizers, we started off with the Burrata salad. We followed with the Pistachio Pasta and Pepperoni Pizza-- both of which were phenomenal and well-portioned, along with two cappuccinos to end the night. The burrata salad was a great blend of fresh yet light. The persimmon complemented the cheese and prosciutto well, while the micro greens were a nice touch (probably for the aesthetic?). Honestly wish there were a bit more greens since it was a salad, but the dish worked and looked very photogenic. The flavor of the pistachio pasta was to die for. It was pretty oily, so I couldn't finish it, but I definitely enjoyed every bite of it. I really appreciate how they use pistachios because it provides a nice crunch and piney taste. I would 10000% come back and order the pasta again!"
4071,"absolutely loved the vibe of the restaurant, great spot for a date and the food was excellent.the cacio e pepe was done so well, it was perfectly balanced between creamy and peppery, a 10/10 in my book. I took my leftovers home and was so excited to eat it again for the second time. i'll definitely be returning for this one! the bone marrow bruschetta -- the bone marrow was great with the onion it's topped with but the bread was almost brittle, it was so hard to chew. I liked this dish but not so sure i'd order again solely because I like softer foods. as always, crispy octopus was a must order and delicious too."
4072,"This was my second time here and I had a lovely dinner. The ambience is warm but airy and there is a ton of seating available (outdoor and indoor). The first time I came it was for a holiday dinner with the team and we all had a memorable time. The second time was this past week to catch up with an old friend. We shared the truffle goat cheese bruschetta and it was divine. The bread with soft, chewy yet crispy and the hazelnut added a nice crunch balancing with the goat cheese. We also got the margherita pizzas. My friend who is from Italy also loved the pizza (so I think that says something lol)."
4073,"Amazing food, highly recommend. My friend and I went splitzys on the pistachio pesto (out of this world) and the truffle pizza, also amazing. We didn't drink here although drinks looked good and wine wouldve paired nice. The pesto is a must, so delicious, perfectly creamy with lots of flavor. It's not too oily, and the sauce and cheese bind into a spectacular dish. The truffle pizza is a must if you love truffle, they have pepperoni on it which adds this amazing spicy tangy flare. I will most definitely be back (and don't @ me if I order the same things lol). seriously that good!"
4074,"Beautiful restaurant, awesome location and service was really good.  BUT the bone marrow was really bad.  I thought it was going to be on bread like others have posted here but it was just one bone, was impossible to get anything out and was mostly garnish.  For the price, it was sad.  Rice balls did strong work to save the meal though!"
4075,Love this spot in Little Italy! The ambiance is amazing indoor as well as outdoor. Did you know their foot long cannoli is seasonal? We got to try out their red velvet cannoli and when we hammered it open m&m's came out. The foot long is definitely meant to be shared by two people. It was also absolutely delicious. We took home everything we couldn't finish. Staff is so friendly and accommodating. The restaurant is clean and everyone is masked. Open now with safety measures in place. Please support your local restaurants!
4076,"Food... really, really good. Ambience... a little loud, with contemporary dance sounds. Wine... also really, really good. Aesthetics... dark, warm & inviting. Waitstaff... Robert was fantastic!!! This EQS the last place in Little Italy we dined, and it far surpassed the others in Little Italy. Highly recommend this delightful eatery."
4077,"OMG heavenly Italian food in this no nonsense joint in NYC's Little Italy. The seating hostess also doubles up as a waitress so don't be surprised if you find her very brisk. Seating is unassuming, there's plenty of outdoor and indoor seating. A straightforward pizza and salad order was served up pretty quickly. Every dish was a knock out. The cheeses are fresh, the greens are crunchy and the pizza base is delightfully crusty. Simple fresh food at it's very best. The pricing is very reasonable. there's a reason why this unassuming restaurant has so many 5 stars. Must must try when in NYC."
4078,"The vongole pasta bucatini is so good! The pasta was perfectly al dente and the clam sauce was delicious. I had to try the capizza because it was such a unique offering- it was good but I think I prefer regular pizza. The toppings were kinda bunched up in the calzone and the cheese was not spread evenly either. The ambiance was amazing - we sat outside and it was a beautiful day the tables were distanced (except we sat on the sidewalk and were back to back with diners inside... doesn't seem like 6 ft if I can touch the person behind me). Other than that, the tables in their outdoor seating setup looked distanced and had separators. I would come back for the pasta for sure!"
4079,"Really like the decor and they offer both indoor and outdoor seats. I was thinking about ordering seafood cioppino but I guess they only serve that dish at dinner. Somehow the description of Vongole caught my attention, my guts tell me the Manila clam and lemon butter sounds great. It totally exceeded my expectations, I love the thick homemade pasta and the bright fresh chili pepper and garlic sauce mixed with butter and lemon. Everything blended perfectly. Also got a bruschetta bread with grilled eggplant for share with my friend. It was very tasty and we devoured all without taking pictures. I would come again to enjoy some pizza and wine."
4080,"Recently dined here for the first time and expectations were exceeded!We had a dinner reservation for 4 in their beautiful outdoor area! Although it was chilly, we were quite toasty with the heater on. All the tables were individually separated which was nice.The food and drinks were delicious and the service was warm and welcoming. I had the braised lamb campanelle and literally cleaned my plate. The mulled wine was actually very good and perfectly boozy.Would highly recommend and will definitely be back."
4081,"Everything was fine and dandy until my drink arrived by the time my main course was done. Bruschetta was OK - it was something I could have made at home and perhaps that is my fault because I knew what bruschetta was and should have known better.My family member and I came here to have a memorable dinner as our last day of the week before the chaos of our week resumed and I am dismayed to say no one told us about water being $6 a bottle. If we knew, we would have never ordered any. I am happy to tell you that our host Taj and our server, despite that small mistake, was very friendly and personable. We just have to come more prepared to spend apparently."
4082,"This place is nice for bigger group dinners, we had 8 of us seated together. Food: Appetizers - We ordered some calamari and truffles honey bruschetta for the table, which both were good! Goat cheese isn't my favorite type of cheese and I usually have to be in the mood for it, and I personally liked the bruschetta better out of the two appetizers. The honey mixed with goat cheese was a really good combo. Main - I ordered the pistachio pesto because I saw it was a popular dish here and a lot of people had good reviews on it. To me, the pasta was average. Nothing that special about it and I think there's other places in the city where you can get way better pasta for the same price. I think the other reviews overhyped this pasta dish, so it probably wouldn't have been as much of a let down if I went in having no expectations. The pasta itself was cooked well and had a good consistency, but I was a bit disappointed in the flavors. There wasn't much pistachio or pesto flavors coming through so I felt like it was a bit bland. I was really hungry this day so I ended up finishing my whole dish, and by the end I was content. I was considering adding a protein to the pasta, but I thought it might be too much, but now looking back, I probably would've added a protein to the dish if I was that hungry.Dessert - We got a massive cannoli for the table which was honestly the perfect size to share with all 8 of us to have a bite! I really like the cannoli, it wasn't too sweet, and had a nice creamy texture. Service: Nothing to complain here about the service, the food came out in a decent amount of time and we had put in a reservation so we were seated immediately. The ambiance is nice and intimate with dimmer lighting."
4083,Ordered their bolognese fettuccine but was disappointed in the dish. The pasta noodles were more in line with thin spaghetti and it was extremely chopped up where it felt like it was feeding a child instead of the typical swirling with a fork. The sauce itself was just mediocre in my opinion. They seemed to really rush us even though there was no wait by clearing our dishes quickly and handing us the check before we even finished half of our drinks. Just disappointed in this overall experience.
4084,"Really rich, delicious pesto-pistachio pasta and a solid tomato sauce with okay meatballs. The burrata in the burrata salad is so creamy, and the outdoor seating is plentiful, though you're staring at the most touristy area of Little Italy. Probably wouldn't come back because there's such good places in the area, but this was still very good."
4085,"This has to be the #1 stop I'll make every time I make the trip out to NY. My 3 friends and I were eating all over the place and decided to stop by little Italy just to try out some good spaghetti. Although we were told there would be a 30 minute wait, we were seated within 5 minutes of entering the restaurant. The wait staff were very friendly and accommodating, checking up on us often and getting us more water and making sure we were comfortable. We're all ""plain janes"" so we all ended up ordering the Spaghetti Pomodoro. The explosion of flavor that hits your mouth with this spaghetti is worth the flight to NY on its own. The pasta is cooked perfectly, and the sauce perfectly coats the entire dish and tastes amazingly delicious and fresh! This is the go-to place for great spaghetti."
4086,"The service was AMAZING. My glass was never empty, they made sure we were comfortable, asked what foods we wanted out first, and made sure we had enough plates and utensils. Now the food? IT WAS AMAZING. I am currently craving that burrata salad. It was the best salad I have ever had. I wished I lived in New York so I can eat it all day everyday. The pistachio pesto pasta was good, just a tad bit too much pesto but still loved it regardless. The pizza was thin, but authentic and it was amazing. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant. I still dream of it till this day and it has been over a week since I have been here."
4087,Great spot! I got the inferno pizza and my friends got the Pistachio Pesto pasta both with chicken. We loved our food! The service was great! The atmosphere was also really nice. All in all would recommend!
4088,"there is a side room downstairs that i am very interested in, some sort of vampire cellar. pasta & meatballs were nothing exciting. ambiance excellent. dark. very foreign staff- a nice touch."
4089,"Incredible food is an understatement. My friend and I ordered the pistachio pesto spaghetti and the truffle mushroom pizza. Who would've thought banana peppers, mushrooms and truffle would go so well together. We literally savored every single bite. The ambiance and vibes at this restaurant were also great. Will definitely be returning here soon for our Italian fix"
4090,The service was ready and we were able to sit immediately without any reservation. This was good to refuel after a day of shopping and walking
4091,"In planning a trip to NY I knew we had to have dinner in Little Italy, so glad I decided this would be the place! We started with the arancini balls which were crispy, fresh and delicious. For my main dish I had the fettuccine bolognese, you can tell the pasta is made fresh daily as it was so tender and savory. The bolognese sauce was perfect! We sat outside and watched the sunset and all of the lights of little Italy turn on around us, great dining experience, service was great. Would definitely come back here!"
4092,"This review is long overdue, but thank you Gelso & Grand for truly making my birthday a special night. The whole vibe and ambiance of the place is beautiful, cozy, and warm. While we waited for our table, my party and I hung out by the bar for drinks. Cocktails were great! We then proceeded to our table, where we were assisted by a young male waiter (I wish I remember the name but he was sooo nice and patient!). The food was absolutely delicious. I'm not crazy about Italian food in general but was super happy with the way everything turned out. All 10 of us agreed that we would return here. Thank you thank thank you again. Cannot wait to come back."
4093,"This place. Just wow. By far, some of the best Italian food I've eaten. We started strong with the sangria pitcher which was amazing!!! Then we got the truffled honey bruschetta which just wow!! Unbelievable. To end it all, we all had different pasta dishes but the cacio e pepe was the best!! Honorable mention to the bolognese and the pesto pastas. Only critique is I wish I had know me sparkling water was extra when the waitress asked if we wanted regular or sparkling water. Best Italian food period"
4094,"Made a reservation here 2-3 weeks prior to the actual reservation date for outdoor seating. We were seated outside on the only table that had no heat lamps or lighting. It was about 35 degrees outside, my friends and I were freezing and we asked the host to move tables because we were cold, to which he replied ""wow"" .... They agreed to move us to another table, but this was 20-30 minutes after they seated us and basically left us to our own accord after taking our drinks, which didn't arrive until we were moved to our new table, which was one table over. Service was absolutely terrible :-( My meatballs in my pasta dish were cold, although the pasta was really good. I don't understand the point of putting the meatballs next to the pasta if you're not heating up the meatballs. If you're going to serve me cold meatballs, at least place them on top of the pasta so the noodles can heat them up. The lamb campanelle was flavorless and bland, had a nice aromatic lamb flavor but just not enough salt or spice in my opinion. To be honest, this was an experience I really wanted to enjoy, and I was willing to overlook the trashy service if the food was good enough, but neither the service or food were up to par with these Yelp reviews. Overall, I'm extremely dissatisfied with this restaurant. Booking a reservation date almost a month prior, I would have hoped to have had decent seating allocated for my party and I but was unfortunately let down by subpar service and subpar food. Definitely not coming back."
4095,"Came here out of whim. Didn't know we needed reservation for regular table, but no complaints. Bar table was perfect enough to be inside. This is a great location for events with friends or dates. The Vibe and food quality was definitely there! I ordered Bolognese and the flavor was well balanced for me. Ordered a bottle of dry red wine and a glass of expresso martini. They have two styles of expresso martini. May sure you letthem know if you like your expresso more or less creamy. It makes a difference."
4096,Such a great more on the modern side spot to eat in Little Italy! I had the Pistachio Pesto and it was sooo yummy. Such good flavors. My sister got the Fettuccine Bolognese and loved it too! The portions were a good size so we all finished our meals pretty satisfied. Overall a good experience with lots of good options for meat eaters and vegetarians alike!
4097,"Gelso & Grand is the best pizza you can order online.I had never heard of them until I decided one evening to order dinner online and saw rave reviews for their pizza.  I soon learnt that this gem from Little Italy is a rare case of when the promise of a business matches up with its product.  Fresh flour: check ... the crust was think yet cushionyRustic authenticity: check ... just look at the photographThey are a full-fledged Italian restaurant with pasta, sandwiches and even a capizza (calzone-pizza hybrid).  But my orders have always been for their pizza.  The margherita and quattro formaggio are both excellent options.  The pizzas are light, so make sure to complement them with other items on the menu or, as in my case, other food in the apartment.I will be sure to sure to Gelso & Grand or, in the near term, to me online ordering portal so I can get their pizza."
4098,"WHY DOES THIS PLACE HAVE GOOD REVIEWS?!My wife and I stopped in here for lunch. They must've had 30 employees working and very few people sitting inside, maybe 4 tables. The waitress came and asked if we wanted water, I said a bottle, and I told her our appetizer order because we were very hungry. Someone else came back with tap water, I asked is this bottled or tap? The women responded oh it's our bottled (tap that they put through a filter I guess?) which isn't bottled. Minor annoyance, but fine, charge us for tap.We waited another 20 minutes with nothing. No one came over for our drink orders, no one came to check on us. After 15 minutes I set a timer, and told my wife if it gets to 5 more minutes I am walking out. At 5:46 I paid for the calamari, and we walked out. Now with 4 waiters, a manager, two bussers, and a bartender, not one person said so much as goodbye, or acknowledged our existence. Beyond terrible customer service. Treated us like we were literal ghosts. On multiple occasions I waved at what looked like the manager, the only person in a sweater who was ordering around the wait staff. No service whatsoever.Don't waste your time!"
4099,There are some places that make you crave their menu items for months - Brown Butter Gnocchi is one of those items. This has become a staple when I am in NYC . Not to mention their Brussel sprouts.... Amazing!
4100,"Pretty affordable spot for Malaysian food in chinatown. Nice for a sit down meal.We came by for a casual lunch date. The inside is surprisingly big and everything felt very clean. It was very busy but we were able to get seated immediately without a reservation.We shared the roti prata and I ordered the Singapore noodles. The roti prata was buttery, flakey, and delicious. I would definitely order more next time.For the Singapore noodles, I'm used to seeing a dish with a lot more turmeric and egg, but I really enjoyed my order at nyonya. It's not too spicy and there's plenty of veggies and shrimp mixed in with the noodles- it felt like a pretty well balanced meal.Overall, would definitely recommend nyonya for dine in and I'm looking forward to trying other parts of their menu."
4101,"Wish I could say my follow up visit was better, and while service was a tad faster, something's definitely changed with this place post pandemic. The dishes are tasty, but there are inconsistencies with serving sizes- some casserole dishes are huge and some are standard size, so we left kinda hungry. When we didn't get rice until we were finished with everything I was just sad. I loved this place and will likely come again, but maybe I'll avoid the weekend from now on."
4102,so sad that the brooklyn nyonya locations closed after all these years. i've been going to nyonya since i was a child with my parents so it's almost nostalgic. there is legit no good malaysian spot in brooklyn anymore. i rarely come to the city location since it's out of the way but since i was in the city today decided to get my malaysian craving with a old neighborhood favorite. luckily it wasn't too busy or any lines so we got seated right away. got the half chicken which was super tender and such a distinct flavor that can't be replicated at other malay spots. of course we got the malay water spinach and indian pancake. malaysian curry is the best curry in my opinion (: overall solid and delicious. take a star away cus it's a bit cramped and service is lacking a bit
4103,"Service was fast and friendly. Food was good but nothing I would crave on a regular basis. Got Roti Canai, Prawn Mee, Kari Ayam (chicken curry). The roti was flakey but didn't pick up the curry dip well, as the curry was a bit too runny. The Prawn Mee tasted singularly of only shrimp paste. The chicken curry was fall off the bone tender, but was a bit too strong on peanut butter. Prices are cheap for the portion sizes, which are pretty big (everything came out to $35 pre tax/tip)."
4104,"Delicious lunch at Nyona!Everyone raves about the Hainanese chicken here but I think the R E A L stars are the NOODS.They make delicious noodles here.My go-to is the Prawn Mee, which features a thick bouncy egg noodle in a super savory SEAFOODY SHRIMPY UMAMI broth, with bean sprouts, tender salty pork, and prawns! But I also love the beef chow fun here with the thick flat rice noodles and perfectly peppery brown saucy flavor.And finally, I stared enviously at my neighbor at the next table who ordered the curry mee with fish-stuffed tofu that is NEXT ON MY LIST TO TRY.Come for the chick(en), stay for the noods."
4105,"Me and my friend originally wanted to go to a Japanese Restaurant on Thanksgiving night for dinner. Upon arriving at that restaurant, we were sad to find out that Google didn't have updated holiday hours. Quick thinking had to be done because I had tickets to watch an 8pm Christmas show at Radio City Music Hall. Luckily, Chinatown was just a few blocks away, and generally most Chinatown restaurants are open during major holidays. We stumbled on Nyonya, as busy as they were that night, we both were able to get a table with no wait time. The place looked very familiar, I think I may have eaten here a few years ago while on vacation! The hostess made us aware that they are cash only, it couldn't have been more perfect timing. I was also lucky because my friend could speak both Mandarin and Cantonese fluently, making it more comfortable ordering food. To me, Malaysian food is a mix of Chinese, Thai, Laotian, Singaporean, and other S.E. Asian cuisines. Few items on the menu were unfamiliar to me, but all we needed to do was ask what is it similar to. We both ordered different types of beer to start off with. She wanted Guiness, and I figure go with Singha. We shared an order of vegetable dumplings, they were not that bad. Hainan chicken with Jasmine Rice, delicious! I personally wasn't impressed with the sizzling beef platter as it arrived hot, but the platter wasn't sizzling at all. And for dessert, a Burbur cha cha, it was like tapioca with taro and potato in it. That was our happy ending for a nice intimate dinner away from our loved ones. Over all, I'd come back again as the area isn't too far from our FiDi hotel. Restaurant is kept clean and just like restaurants in Hawaii, where we live, only vaccinated customers can enter eateries in NYC. Also the price is right, the service is quick and friendly, and the restrooms are inside the restaurant not having to share with other businesses in the surrounding area."
4106,"This place is incredible!Homemade Roti Canal - 10/10. Super thin and flaky, crispy and airy. And the curry sauce it came with was so flavorful! I want to eat this every day. Spareribs Malaysian Style - 8/10. Also super flavorful! I don't think I've ever tried anything like it. The meat is pretty tender but minus 2 points because it was bone in. I like boneless. Indian Mee Goreng - 9/10. I love noodles and this did not disappoint! Very flavorful, and I really liked the texture of the tofu that was in this. This place wasn't on our radar originally, but it was raining and conveniently located across the hotel we were staying at. We might not stay at the same hotel next time we're in town but will definitely come back to eat here!**cash only!"
4107,This was one of those silent meals because everything was so good and everyone was too busy stuffing their faces to speak.   I came here with a group of friends on a weekend kind of later in the evening maybe around 8/9pm so there wasn't a wait. We ordered a bunch of dishes to share family style but the ones I would suggest as must gets are the roti and the hainanese chicken/rice. Everything seemed pretty authentic as well. I'm definitely eating here again. *they are a cash only restaurant*
4108,"I was excited to come back to one of my favorite Malaysian spots after a few years. The staff seemed to ignore us because we didn't speak Chinese. First, we ordered the bean sprouts and Nyonya sampler, followed by 2 soups. One soup came out with the Sprouts- our waitress sat down to eat. We called two other ones to remind them of the initial order. Got the prawn mee soup that I asked to be extra spicy 10 minutes later and the original appetizer after we were halfway done with the soups. The soup didn't come out spicy and we're lukewarm- we had to flag them several times to our dissatisfaction. Not wanting to bother them, we chose to eat what we could, and excuse ourselves to another restaurant. The food had the making to be something much better than the service helped it to be. Waste of $60. We were gonna order a bunch of takeout to go, and just don't see ourselves returning. Most of the staff were rude."
4109,"I feel conflicted about my rating because, as the other reviews have shown, the food at Nyonya is great. If you're going with other people, you MUST get the roti canai to share - the roti is flaky and the curry side is small but flavorful. I've gotten the tom yum seafood soup here before, and it was delicious, though the seafood in there was pretty sparse. This time, my friend got the fish head soup (which she really liked), and I got the chow kueh teow. My noodles were delicious and drenched in sauce, which was pretty salty, but I wouldn't expect anything differently. The portion size was decent as well. Unfortunately, on two occasions during that dinner, I had swallowed part of very long strands of hair that were not mine, and I had to pull them out of my mouth/throat, which was a really unpleasant experience. (You couldn't see them either, since the noodle dish is sticky and saucy.) The first time this happened, I could have brushed off as a fluke, but the second one made me wonder what was going on. All in all, the delicious dish was marred by this experience; I would have a hard time ordering a noodle dish or entree from here again."
4110,"I'm from the SF Bay Area, and while there are a bunch of good food options, Malaysian food out there hasn't been as strong as it used to be, which is why when I'm in town I get food from Nyonya.I picked up take-out from them recently, and their food is still very good. Their Sarang Burong (which has fried taro nest filled with cooked chicken and seafood), and other authentic Malaysian items.They are CASH ONLY, which they will remind you about, so keep that in mind."
4111,Nyonya is really good! We walked in on a Friday evening around 6:30 pm and got seated right away. It's pretty big inside. The fried buns appetizer is so good we ordered two of them. The mee siam was also my favorite dish here. Definitely worth trying out even if there's a wait.
4112,"Many popular places don't live up to the fam and hype but Nyonya does. They have been in this same grand street location my whole life, the excellent cooking and flavors have always been consistent. A plus is their extensive menu with Malaysian staple dishes but also lesser known traditional dishes. The chow Kueh teow is a must get it's almost like a cross between pad Thai and beef chow fun. If you go to a Malaysian restaurant and do not order the roti or satay you are doing it all wrong. I prefer the roti prata because it's thicker, absorbs the curry much better and is on the chewier side unlike the roti canai which is crispier. Everything here was excellent, it's  great for a date night or family outing."
4113,"We went there for lunch on a weekend. I've been here a few times over the years and quality stands up. We started with the Roti canai, which is flakey, buttery flatbread you dip in chicken curry. Hard to describe but outstanding.  Then I had chicken curry with rice noodles soup. The thick noodles were perfectly chewy and complimented the rich broth. There are so many dishes to choose from and the prices are such a good deal."
4114,"* More like 3.5 * Cash only, pretty dim inside and short staffed. Portions are on the smaller and pricer side. Staff was more interested in eating their own dinners than waiting tables. Hainan chicken was the star. The roti was good but overly flakey and messy - curry was delicious.BYOB policy is great - no corkage fee."
4115,Nyonya has been a chinatown mainstay for decades. You must try the roti canai (I recommend one per person) as well as the haianese chicken dish. I wish they weren't cash only but there's a nearby Chase which is convenient.
4116,"Had the chance to dine here with a small but hungry party so got to try a number of things depicted in the pictures. One person in our party had been there and recommended the spot. Ambiance is nice with lots of room and can easily fit large parties.The pork belly was the shining star. It came with a nice portion and was exquisitely tender and well seasoned. Aside from that, each dish was ok - nothing stellar or to specifically recommend. I was particularly let down by the sesame chicken, each piece had a large amount of breaded fat and connective tissues, after each additional piece I had I was hoping to find some juicy tender meat, but was more dissatisfied the more that I ate.Noodles had a nice texture, but also lacking in salt and overall flavor, glad to have the pork belly sauce to help it along the way. Curry that came with the roti was good.Unfortunately most dishes were overall lacking in vital parts. While consistency is what makes the good restaurants great - I am hoping it was just an off day for them, but not sure I'll be back anytime soon."
4117,"It's CASH ONLY here! My partner and I were in the vicinity today and stopped here for lunch. We started with the roti canai, an Indian pancake that's both soft and crispy that you dip in a curry dipping sauce, which has a couple pieces of chicken and a piece of potato.  Very tasty! We ordered a soup called bah kut teh, which is a soup comprised of Chinese herbs and pork ribs along with some other pieces of pork.  This is a tasty, light soup with no carbs. Next, we ordered the curry mee with young tau foo, which comprised of egg noodle, spicy lemongrass with coconut curry soup base, tofu, and a mild jalapeno stuffed with a fishcake like ingredient.  There is also a slice of bitter melon...it's very bitter and I could not ingest it...some people like it though.  This is a perfect dish for a cold day! Lastly, we ordered the sizzling seafood combination delight, which comprised of shrimp, scallop, squid, carrots, mushrooms, snowpeas and green bell peppers.  The sauce was light, not spicy and combined perfectly with all the ingredients. Overall, the food and service were great and we'll be returning to try the many other dishes that are offered here!"
4118,"We came here on Chinese New Year for dinner, since we are not in the mood for cooking. For starters, we ordered the deep fried squid balls, beef satay skewers, and the roti canai. The squid balls were ok, but there is definitely better appetizer options. The main problem with the squid balls is that there was barely any squid inside, which was a pretty big let down. However, the other appetizers we got are a must try. Whenever I have Malaysian food, I cannot resist from getting roti canai and this place did not disappoint! The bread is thin and fluffy, while the dipping sauce has a whole lot of flavors and spices involved. The flavor is not too spicy, so I was able to still enjoy it, it was definitely hard not getting full off this because I just kept wanting more. Also another very good appetizer option is the beef satay, which was a little sweet and savory. The beef was grilled really nicely and stayed juicy. It was paired with some sort of peanut sauce that complimented the flavor of the beef well. For our main dishes, we got string beans, eggplants with salted fish, sweet and sour pork, and beef noodles. Every one of these dishes were so tasty, but one of my favorites were the string beans. It was cooked well because it was still crunchy and not raw inside. I didn't really care much for the shrimp, since the string beans blew me away from the texture to the flavor. Their other dishes were great as well and I really enjoyed their beef noodles. We also got salted fish fried rice, which was nice to eat with protein or veggie dishes or just to eat alone. Absolutely loved this place and will be coming back."
4119,"First off this place is CASH ONLY! Roti canai with the chicken/potato curry dip is everything. If it was up to me I'll eat this dish everyday. I'm very picky where I get Roti canai, but this place makes it just right, thick and crispy. The shrimp with lady fingers has the right amount of spice to it and it's a bit slimy due to the okra but I find it so delicious."
4120,"Highly recommend the food at this restaurant, very authentic and delicious.However, I was a bit of disappointed today. Their service really turn me down. The chicken was late and we did not have it until we almost finished our lunch.I asked the waitress to pack our steam chicken and she put all the sauce in the box (see attached picture) that leaked in our bag. Even worse, they threw away our chilly sauce that came with the chicken and did not give us one. So I asked for a additional sauce and I was asked to pay for $0.25. Excuse me?Well, after the waiter checked our to-go box, the fee was waived.FYI, the restaurant was not even half full today, so no excuse for slacking"
4121,"I've heard many good things about Nyonya so I gave it a try and unlike many other places it actually lived up to the hype! The staff was friendly and helpful with suggestions. The food came out extremely fast and all seemed quite fresh and flavorful. The longan drink was a bit disappointing since it just tasted like sugary syrup and not really much like longan, but all of the food was delicious, so I'd definitely plan to come back. One of the best parts is just how affordable the meals here can be."
4122,"Roti canai- they forgot or took too long, we finished our meal already .  they took it off the billBeef rendang- very tender, not salty. Delicious and fragrant. Perfect to eat with coconut rice!Coconut rice-  normal rice w coconut flavorService-. 4 stars.  Cleanliness- floor is clean, it's rare to see non oily, clean floor in Chinatown."
4123,"Imported spices complemented by the subtle fragrance of the Ginger flower,  Kaffir leaves, and Galanga are crucial in the making of authentic Nyonya cuisine. Sauces made from coconut milk, tamarind seeds, and curry pastes  (freshly pounded with shallots, garlic, lemon grass, ginger, and selected curry mix) are a testament to an excellent cooked meal of a Nyonya. They had a tasty hot and spicy sauce that was somewhat hot. My friend said to try it because it makes you feel good and maybe was good as a cure for colds. I couldn't eat as much as I wanted to because my tummy was full from what I was eating. I had a shrimp dish with okra in a special sauce. Overall everything tasted Great!"
4124,"Came here based on a recommendation from a friend saying that Nyonya has some of the best Malaysian food in the city and it definitely did not disappoint. For a party of five, we got 2 roti canai and one each of fried rice with salted fish, kang kung belacan, nyonya kari ayam, and chow kueh teow, which was a little more than enough for us to feel more than satisfied.The roti canai were super crisp and flaky and the curry it came with was solid. The fried rice was excellent with individual grains, we'll cooked protein, and we'll seasoned. Everything else was also excellent. They're all relatively simple dishes, so there's less room to hide in terms of execution, but they were all done well. I definitely would want to come back again."
4125,"After a dissappointing Malaysian lunch in Flushings, our day was salvaged by wonderful doordash from Nyonya. Nasi lemak was excellent: fragrant coconut rice, salty & crunchy anchovies, tender curry chicken, the only thing missing was a scoop of sambal. Asam laksa broth was heavenly, you can tell they boiled the fish until it melted into the soup.  It took our palate a few seconds to adjust to the level of sourness & spice, but once it did it was slurp heaven.  Nadi lemak & Asam laksa are the 2 most iconic dishes in Malay cuisine, Nyonya executed it perfectly.  We can't wait to visit the restaurant itself & sample other items."
4126,"You will almost never hear me complain about a broth being too strong, especially too seafood-strong, but this one... they have to make sure the shrimp they're using for the prawn mee broth are very fresh, because it tasted a little old-shrimp to me. And I'm not talking about dried shrimp, or shrimp paste, or any of the ways shrimp are supposed to be when they're not fresh. I just mean shrimp that's a little past where it should be. If the shrimp had been fresher, this broth would have been AMAZING.As it was, it was still tasty, and the pork slices were heavenly little sheets of melt in your mouth goodness, and the noodles soaked up the shrimp broth in a way that was pleasant and not seafood-bomby like the broth straight.We also got char kuey teow. No blood cockles again - damn. (Does ANYWHERE in the US have blood cockles??) But aside from some overcooked squid, the flavor was really good, really charred, tasting straight from a well seasoned wok."
4127,"One of our go-to spots because it's reasonably-priced, very tasty, and we are always able to get seated within a few minutes. NOTE: They are cash-only, we have found ourselves scrambling to see how much cash we have between us to cover the bill a handful of times, so this is as much a reminder to me as it is to you.The most popular thing here is definitely that roti canai, and you can tell because it is visually very distinctive and you'll see it on almost every single table. The servers bring them out 4 or 5 at a time, they're a fun appetizer, and legitimately very tasty to enjoy. I've tried a couple of things here like the nasi lemak, Hainan chicken rice, vegetable curry, and more and everything has been pretty dang delicious. I always feel a bit surprised at the price, since I typically expect them to be higher on this stretch of Grand and especially for the sit-down ambiance they have going on. Definitely a great stop if you'd like to sit and have a nice Malaysian meal!"
4128,"We didn't waste any time and hit the fan favorites here for a solid review. -Homemade Roti Canai: Thin, hot and flaking all over the table. I was obsessed with the hot chicken curry it came with. Definitely don't miss this!-Hainanese Chicken: Chicken rice was delicious -- fluffy, separate bits of rice with enough chicken flavor. Definitely not the best I've had but it was light and flavorful. The chicken itself was good, but I've had better.-Beef Rendang: Spice was perfect, beef was tender and the sauce to rice ratio was perfect.Service was solid and food came out very quickly. I'd definitely try other dishes next time!"
4129,"Came here on a Friday evening for dinner and the place was pretty busy, but we were seated immediately. The menu is huge - definitely a lot to browse! We ordered one appetizer and three other dishes for three people and it was enough to leave us stuffed. We had two orders of rice along with that ( I'd recommend the chicken broth type! ) and were definitely more than full.The chicken was tender and delicious while the noodles were good - the ratio of meat and veggies to noodles was pretty good. The eggplant was very heavy on the shrimp flavor ( we got chicken with it instead but the amount of shrimp paste was pretty overpowering ) but overall still pretty delicious. I enjoyed the roti a lot as well - I think this was definitely a must-order as everyone around us had a serving as well.Overall I found this place to be a good spot for decent Malaysian food. If I'm ever in the area again and craving roti, I'd definitely stop by again!"
4130,"Came for a Sunday lunch walk-in and it wasn't too crowded, was seated immediately.The seating in the back in interesting; there's a clear divider over a table separating the two half's, so you are facing another dinner party during your meal.I got the vegetable miso ramen. So good! My favorite vegetarian ramen in the city is from Tonchin so I was surprised to find that this is just as good. The broth is super flavorful, and the crispy teriyaki tofu adds such interesting flavor and texture to the bowl. The accompanying chili oil was also amazing, I loved how they didn't charge you for that like most places do."
4131,It was a coolish day in NYC and I was by Grand Central and decided to head to Momosan for lunch.I decided to go for the set lunch and a pork bao. For the set I decided to go with the Tuna Don and the Tonkotsu Ramen.The pork bao is just ok. I prefer the soft shell crab  bao that I've hd before. Tuna Don was great and reminded just how much I enjoy raw tuna. The tonkotsu was good. The broth is not as heavy as some other well known ramen spots so you won't come away with that sometimes heavy feeling.The space is sleek and the service was attentive.
4132,"My wife and I were looking for a new ramen restaurant to check out and Momosan came up HOT! The restaurant is hip, modern interior designed, with house music. The vibe is of a restaurant you would find in the West Village or downtown, but in Midtown. We came on a Sunday night at 7:30 and this place was packed. Fortunately we were able to sit at the bar with no wait, but even if there was a wait, we would have been seated pretty quickly. They have a great selection of beers, sake (the majority of the menu), cocktails, and some mocktails that looked really great as well.We ordered 2 glasses of Sake, the soft shell crab bun and spicy salmon sushi to start. We LOVED both appetizers we got. The soft shell crab was crunchy, spicy, savory and just amazing - highly recommended! The spicy salmon roll was great as well. It is not just chopped/minced pieces of salmon... I saw the chef make it and they use a large chunk of salmon (or any other fish) and keep it whole. The green onions in there were a nice touch.On to the ramen. I got the tonkotsu ramen with pork. It was decent but not as salty as I'd like; I think the soup could use some more of pork flavor. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid ramen but I think comparable tonkotsu ramen at Hide Chan is more flavorful. The noodles were cooked well. I would highly recommend using the ramen pepper and spicy sauce they have available.My wife got the chicken ramen, and substituted the chicken for tofu. Her soup was much more flavorful and tasty. I couldn't stop stealing some spoonfuls of her soup! This one I would get again... or try the other ones on the menu because we're definitely going to come back!Overall - food here is solid. I would come here as a nice, chic restaurant that is good for smaller sized groups (5 or less)."
4133,"Momosan is a great find.  My daughter raved about it after finding it on the internet.  Being a fan of Chef Morimoto , I decided to try it.  Not only was it delicious but it was cheap, especially for NYC.  I had the Momosan dinner set which was a choice of appetizer and a Ramen.  My husband and I ordered 2 different appetizers and 2 different Ramens.  I had the Spicy Dan Dan Ramen.  It was amazing!!  It had a creamy broth with tender, thin slices of pork that were just delicious ! My husband got the tonkatsu which he loved .  For the appetizers we split the Duck Tacos and the Kakuni Bao Buns. I wish I had them right now!  The Duck are 2 tiny crispy tacos filled with crispy , golden slices of duck and scallions  Absolutely amazing flavor!  The Kakuni Bao Buns were big filled with tender braised pork belly.  A MUST have!  So the food is excellent and what makes it even better?  The price - $25 for the Dinner set!!  Loved it so much we went back a few weeks later.  Ordered the same thing because it was that good!!"
4134,"Momosan is a trendy ramen spot owned by Iron Chef Morimoto. The interior of the restaurant looks both sleek and modern. Upon entering, you will notice various COVID-19 precautions, such as the barriers between the tables of two. If you are dining as two, expect to sit next to your party. If you are dining as four, expect a typical dining table. There is an extensive selection of appetizers, ramen, sushi bowls, and sushi rolls.Soft Shell Crab Bao ($10) - I am usually a sucker for baos, especially ones that are a bit unique. This was one was definitely pleasing to the eye. It was a bao with a seasoned soft-shell crab, with lettuce, pickled cucumbers, and spicy mayo. Aside, from it being a tad bit salty, I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. Tetsunabe Kakuni ($12) - This was intriguing as I never heard of this dish. It included three large pieces of braised pork belly on a bed of moyashi and was topped with sweet shashu sauce. This  dish packs a subtle punch! Definitely try this out if you like pork belly!Tonkatsu Ramen ($16) - The main course! A signature dish of many ramen restaurants and Momosan's execution was spot on. A flavorful pork broth, topped with pork chashu, mushroom, takana, and aji-tama was just what the doctor ordered on a rather chilly Thursday night. Shrimp Tempura Roll ($10) - Great sushi. Rice was smooth. The filling was abundant and the toppings were fresh. If you plan on getting ramen and an appetizer, be sure to order the Momosan set, to save a couple of bucks. Service was quick and attentive. Be sure to arrive in advance because this place gets pack really quick!!"
4135,"Got seated right away on a Monday night at 6pm, but it does get pretty busy later on during hot dinner time! Down side was that I was a party of two, and we were seated facing the windows outside. It was kind of hard to talk with my friend, but also was a bit uncomfortable seeing other people's faces from outside, looking into the windows to see us eating our food..But the food tasted great and I left feeling content! There is a set where you can pick an appetizer and a ramen, which my friend and I both did. The broth for the ramen wasn't too salty, which I appreciated a lot. The kakuni bao was a bit too glazed and there was only a piece of lettuce in the bun, so it was a bit salty. But the meat was very tender and nice. The pork gyoza came out sizzling and tasted pretty good!Service gets okay once it gets hectic, as they barely check up on you and forget what you asked for. But overall, it was still a good experience and I was very full afterwards!"
4136,"Came here with a group of 5 and was greeted with the nicest server. I asked about his favorite dishes and what would be the best dish for me since I didnt want anything overaly spicy. He was VERY honest on 1)what drinks he liked 2) what dish he think Ill like. The drink he recommended was 10/10 i actually would come back just for this drink lol It was thee sake sangria carafe! For someone who doesnt necessary like strong tasting drinks while they eat- this was perfect, it was light, medium sweet, and but still has that texture where you know theres alc in there but if no one told you - you wouldnt knowThe mango matchachu sounded soo gooood but the waiter did say it had a thicker texture like almost slushy and he didnt personally like it so i trusted him!I got the M O M O S A N S E T which comes with a ramen and appetizer -Waiter recommended the softshell bao and at first glance - tbh it looked scary hahah but also very cool - the flavor was amazing and cooked perfectlyI got the t o n k o t s u ramen and honestly was my least favorite part..it was just meh. lol i actually added chili oil to it to add some OOMPF but it only did so much. I think the broth and noodles together felt very one-toned, wish there was more flavor combos in it to add dimension!"
4137,"My original review got flagged and taken down. Not sure why maybe it's because they said ""Covid,"" and you're not supposed to say that. You also aren't supposed to say the truth about people who don't comply with these mandates.TL;DR: FORCED COMMUNAL TABLES! REQUEST FOR (EMPTY) BOOTH...VEHEMENTLY DENIED. ZERO EXAGGERATION. COMMUNAL TABLES HAD NO PLEXIGLASS. I CHECKED AND AT TYE TINE OF OUR VISIT IT WAS STILL MANDATED.Are you care about these things or not if they are following this phone knows what they're doing with regards to Board of Health stuff. They were also as nasty as can be, both the hostes and the manager who when I asked if I could sit in the booth said ""only for health reasons,"" I said ""I don't want to get Covid."" The manager took a definite pause of at least two seconds to I would guess it was to contemplate it. Well that reason still wasn't enough. What if I was the one with Covid? Of course I shouldn't be out etc. but that's not the point. He would not have sat me alone, he would've made me sit with you. At the communal table with no plexiglass."
4138,"We loved Morimoto's restaurant in Philly and had to try his ramen place in NYC on our recent trip --- and we were not disappointed! Momosan does not take reservations, but we were able to be seated immediately when we arrived around 1 PM for a late lunch. They did check vaccine cards and all of their communal tables have been set up with plastic dividers so that pairs of diners are appropriately separated (though it is a bit awkward to sit directly across from a stranger, especially if you aren't confident in your chopstick skills). I wound up ordering their lunch special, which features a smaller portion of ramen (with just four options) and your choice between several types of rice or a sushi roll. This wound up being an absolutely perfect portion of food for me for $18. I chose the Tonkotsu, which was delicious and the noodles were perfect. My aji-tama yolk was more cooked than I typically expect, but I may have just let it sit in the hot broth for too long. I also ordered the spicy salmon roll, which tasted fresh, delicious, and was not drenched in spicy mayo as you all too often see. I also enjoyed the little cup of pickled cucumbers that accompanied the lunch portion.My fiance wanted to try the soft shell crab bao, so he wound up ordering that along with a full portion of the Tan-tan ramen. The soft shell crab bao was good, though way spicier than we anticipated. Meanwhile, the Tan-Tan ramen had broth that was more creamy than spicy and was overall tasty, though we preferred the Tonkotsu. I'd definitely come back here for a weekday lunch next time I'm in NYC."
4139,"Such a great spot! I got the tonkatsu ramen, pork belly and soft shell crab bao. I liked the dinner special where you can get a bao and ramen for $23. Would highly recommend the soft shell crab bao but the pork belly one is just ok - a bit too salty and saucey for my liking. Ramen was very flavorful. Overall, I would come again!"
4140,"Excellent lunch specials. Ramen and a Sushi roll for $18. Delicious and such a great deal. Clean and modern atmosphere, very professional staff. I'll be back!"
4141,"My friend split one of the pork buns with me and it was very tender. The tsukemen is just okay--it's a little thin, and I found myself wanting more flavor, especially for the price. I've heard the other ramen here is wonderful, and I would like to try the others."
4142,"I am so glad that they deliver during this pandemic and the quality remains the same.  Because it is dead of winter and is really cold, I felt like having soup!  So I thought of MOMOSAN where I can have a hearty soup! I added more meat which I probably did nit have to.  Fortunately I am home and I could have the rest for lunch.  The soft shell crab bun was also delicious! I have never had it this way before.  It is quite good.  I chose it to be my appetizer for the meal set with my ramen soup.I microwaved it a little bit without the egg so I do not over cook the perfectly soy marinated soft boiled egg.  Delicious!  What can I say.  Good winter food!"
4143,"This is a decent ramen shop with good variety, meal sets, which stands out more so for its sake selections. The ramen is good, but largely lacks in flavor. The tonkotsu just doesn't have the same level of richness that I like, so it leaves me wanting at the end. The tan tan ramen is verrrry rich and creamy, with big sesame flavor. It is a bit hard to finish though because of how rich it is (think drinking sesame broth with the texture of coconut milk). It's pretty delicious though!! I would go here first for sake, and maybe order from the menu if I was hungry. I would not necessarily go here for ramen for my first choice as there are other options close by that I prefer."
4144,"Delicious ramen, gyoza dumplings and pork belly. I ordered the Dan Dan noodles. Contained the perfect level of spice and seasoning. The gyoza was crisply topped with a popular Chinese sauce made with ginger, green onion, salt and oil. The pork belly was tender and melted in your mouth, Worth the price. I found this spot to be pretty low key. Didn't even know it existed till a friend recommended."
4145,"Really loved this place. We didnt get to order and sit in the dining area  this time, but even so the food that we took togo was really good. I'm glad we got to try it because the Tonkatsu was really good. The broth was flavorful and the noodles were perfectly cooked. The service was great as well! Our whole family liked everything they ordered. Definitely will have to try actually eating inside the next time we come."
4146,"Nice date spot restaurant or a place to rest after work. Nice ramen good broth. Nice service. Would be nice if used a little less sesame oil.small spot, chef fresh cut sashimi and bbq small dishes on counter . It was a good dinner."
4147,"Slipped up on this place accidentally. Of course, used Yelp to find a location for Ramen. This was the first suggestion. Didn't realize until looking at website that it's owned by THE IRON CHEF himself ""Chef Morimoto""!!! So, I was excited to visit until we got there and my daughter had to constantly get the attention of the wait staff in order to receive any assistance. Had to call waiter over to order, after sitting for at least 5-10 min. Call waiter for utensils. Called waiter over for EVERYTHING! But, the food was pretty good. We enjoyed the duck tacos, sticky ribs, karaage (fried boneless chicken), and TanTan Ramen. The broth. The noodles. Really good! Appreciate that they have extra spices on the table to add to your Ramen. The appetizers were really good. I would probably go again if I'm in the area but wouldn't travel just to go there due to the service NOPE!!"
4148,"We arrived after 7pm on a Saturday and only had to wait 15 or so minutes! We were thrilled. Our waitress was super friendly and the beverages were fun. We LOVED the fried chicken! It was delicious. The buns ... I would not get again, really not much flavor. Tonkatsu was delicious. The main issue, besides the bland buns was that it took over 30 minutes to get our food - I mean any food. Tons of other tables were served. When we asked about it it came - but not ideal. All in all, go for the fried chicken and ramen just be ready to wait!"
4149,"Awesome ramen spot! Had Tonkotsu, rich flavor, I wish more meat in it. Side dish edamame is good. The other set is dandan noodle w duck taco. I really love the taco. Very different and the duck is cooked to perfection."
4150,"This place is pretty good with safety measures. Some proof of vaccine to remove mask all the time was required which I liked.Got the tonkotsu ramen and for me I enjoyed the two pieces of pork which had my desired fat to meat ratio, broth was also nice. It's not special but hits the spot, especially for its price point. If anything you MUST get the karaage and tetsunabe kakuni. Absolute game changer. Also had some sake but definitely could have done without it. Not great but I won't reduce my rating."
4151,"This has to be one of the best meals I've ever had! The food here is incredible - this meal actually left me speechless. Perfect blend of flavors in every dish (I seriously cannot pick a favorite) and best of all, it's well-priced. I wish there was one out in the LA area, because I would frequent this place weekly if I could. Dreaming about this meal and will definitely be back next time I'm in NY!"
4152,"8.5/10Tan-tan ramen: broth was very thick, perhaps a tad too thick, but had a very potent sesame flavor; ground pork and sliced pork added some nice meat flavor to the dish; cilantro also was a good addition, but one of the vegetables was sliced a bit too large, so that was a slight negative; noodles were good, held the thick broth really well; egg is nice; nice amount of spiciness, although could be just slightly spicier; overall, very good bowl of ramen, a bit too thick, but very good flavor"
4153,"This hidden gem was 4 minute walking distance from our hotel. Love this place. Great food, customer service,  and atmosphere.  When in NY, it's a MUST tey!"
4154,"it's a nice place in midtown to get a lunch. i was seated pretty quickly which was great. ordered the tonkatsu w a pork belly bao. it took 27 minutes to come out. a pair that was seated after me was finished with their food by the time mine came out... even the server was confused when i asked where my food was (""half an hour!???"") the pork belly was delicious- very melt in your mouth moment. the lettuce kind of threw me off as it was a singular slab of lettuce. but star of the show was the meat so it was yummy. the ramen was also really good, only issue was that the broth was extra salty. egg was nice and gummy."
4155,I just loved the taste here. Ramen is my new favorite because of my visit. Amazingly delicious. I wish they had one in Virginia! Yummy.
4156,"This was my second time coming here and overall I was decently satisfied. We didn't have a reservation so she told us to wait outside. Surprisingly, we only had to wait around 15 minutes! She had us show our vaccination cards and IDs and we were then seated. To be honest, the service wasn't great. It took 30 minutes for them to come to our table to take our order and it isn't even a big restaurant. The next time I visit New York, I would definitely come back here again!On the menu, they have a combo which you can pick an appetizer and a ramen for $23 so we ordered two of those. Spicy Tan Tan Noodles & Soft Shell Bao - The noodles had a pleasant slight coconut flavor and it perfectly balanced out the spice. The bao tasted delicious and the sauce that the crab had was fantastic. 5/5Tonkotsu Ramen & Karaage - The broth of the ramen was wonderful and so flavorful, the noodles cooked to perfection. The karaage was super crispy and the sauce at the bottom went perfectly. 5/5Tsukemen - The broth came separately from the noodles and it was awesome! The broth had a super powerful pork flavor that you couldn't miss. I couldn't drink it on its own, but with the noodles it was perfect. 5/5Tetsunabe Kakuni - I was expecting perfect melt-in-your-mouth pork belly with the most delicious sauce, but I was disappointed. The pork belly was tough and hard to chew and the sauce was okay. 3/5"
4157,"Great atmosphere, very friendly staff. I was on my own and sat by the bar. The food was delicious. I had the spicy wonton as starter. It was so good. The awesome bartender then suggested the Tan Tan ramen. The portion was huge and so tasty."
4158,Came on a Saturday morning while visiting NY. They had a great combo set (get the pork bun side dish) and I had the tan tan Ramen and my girlfriend had the tsukemen(dipping) Ramen. The tan tan is highly recommended for people who like Thai-ish flavor and I loved it! My girlfriend loved the dipping Ramen and I stole a bite and it was super good hehe.. The Tsukemen was really savory and recommended for people who like the more traditional Ramen. More than anything the service here was AMAZING. Treated us with a lot of respect and made sure that we were having a great and comfortable time. A very clean modern interior design that stands out as soon as you walk in. I hope to be back next time I'm in New York!
4159,"Being a ramen lover decided to try this place out upon good reviews, but unfortunately this place was such a let down.First, right when we entered the restaurant no greeting no warm welcome.Second, asked the older server lady what was most popular and if she had any recommendations. she was not the nicest and responded in an irritated tone. Third, decided to try the shoyu food came out the chicken topping was cold! told the server chicken was cold and she says it's suppose to be cold just warm it up in the soup, but soup was also room temperature... i guess it was an off day? overall it wasn't a good experience"
4160,Went here with a friend to just enjoy a nice lunch. We really liked their ramen! They also checked for vaccination at the door and had glass between different tables
4161,"always a delight @ momosan. honestlyyyyy, their ramen isn't the BEST ramen i've had in nyc but their appetizers are top notch. i 1000% recommend getting the soft shell crab bao; since i've tried it, I've ordered it every time and it never disappoints. they are getting a little busier now that covid restrictions are lifting, but we were able to get a table for 2 on a Tuesday night without waiting."
4162,"I always wanted to try one of this restaurants, finally i had the chamce and i can say it held to my expectations, i triedKakun Bao: the bun was so soft and flufy and the pork perfectly seasoned with good balance of sweet and savory.Tonkotsu Ramen: Its a nice broth not to salty and very rich texture, For a drink: Mango matchatzu: very refreshing drink that really goes well after you finish your meal. imdefinitely will try again soon while im here in NYC since we dont have one in Texas :("
4163,Overall (4.75/5): My favorite ramen spot. If you need ramen look no further. Food (5/5):Atmosphere (4/5): Uniqueness (4/5): Value (5/5):
4164,"While the takeout options simply don't match a hot bowl of ramen during dine in season, Momosan is still an excellent spot for ramen in the city. I appreciate the good packaging for takeout: separation of noodles, soups, and toppings. Unfortunately, the noodles do clump, but nothing that can't be fixed by reheating Standouts: tsukemen combo set with karaage. Karaage is on the saltier side but generously seasoned."
4165,"Ok food and not so friendly service especially if you are within 30 min of closing time. It was a cold night and my in laws had just landed for a fun weekend in nyc. We decided to get some ramen in the neighborhood and stumbled upon this place. We arrived probably 30 min before their posted closing time thinking we had plenty of time. The first thing the server told us when she arrived is the kitchen closes in 10 minutes. Ok then make your closing time earlier. I got the tsukemen ramen and when it arrived it was with a side of dipping broth with instructions not to pour the broth into the noodles. Well that's great given I wanted a bowl of soup and noodles. In the middle of us eating, the waitress literally came over and asked us to pay. Mind you we are still earlier than their posted closing time. Um ok, thanks for ruining the meal. She then proceeds to start mopping the floor near our table, the whole situation was unbelievable and laughable. We paid and left, good riddance. We'll go somewhere else where we aren't rushed out."
4166,"This used to be my favorite Ramen spot in the city. Unfortunately, shortly after opening they seemed to have changed their tonkotsu recipe to use a different slice of pork, and it doesn't quite do it for me anymore.Don't get me wrong, it's still very good. My friend raves about the spicy tan tan Ramen, and we both enjoy their pork buns and don bowls. But as someone who's always favored straight up tonkotsu, I can't justify coming here regularly when it's been perfected at ichiran"
4167,"Came for lunch today. Clean and cool atmosphere, great diligent and friendly service. Had the momosan set with tonkatsu ramen and a soft shell bao. I will dream about the bao, it was phenomenal. I am no ramen expert or snob but it was also delicious. I wanted to try a cold sake but didn't really know what to order and the waitress, Samantha, recommended a great, reasonably priced one and then gave great info and tips on sipping sake! Service was fast, too! Would definitely return and recommend!"
4168,"Knowing that this is one of Iron Chef Morimoto's restaurants, I knew that I would not be disappointed and I certainly wasn't. My friend and I came for dinner one night around 7:00 and were seated inside immediately. Their COVID19 precautions are great and we felt safe while dining inside. We both opted to get the combo which came with our choice of app and a ramen. I chose the soft shell bao and tantan ramen and my friend chose the gyoza and chicken ramen. When I tell you everything was perfect and spot on, it is entirely true. The tantan broth was so deliciously creamy with hints of coconut and perfect amount of spice! To top it off, I live only one block away so I will be back in person or for take out very soon. This is a must go to in my book!"
4169,"Was there last Tuesday. We had so many wonderful appetizers, it was a ridiculous treat! Everything was super, We especially loved the best Spare Ribs in the world! The Gyoza served on a Sizzle Platter with a splash of Saki was really special as was the Crab on a sticky bun. Also the Tuna Don was fresh and plentiful"
4170,"Ordered Bingsoo - Matcha & Cheesecake. This was fantastic. All the components added something nice, either a crunch, a tender chew, or a complementary flavor. Eating this was just really fun too. I didn't know exactly what to expect before ordering, but the bingsoo kept surprising me with new elements after every few bites.The small size was enough to split between 2 people."
4171,"Sweet Moment has been on our bucket list for shaved ice for a while and we finally got a chance to try it. The decor is simple and cozy but the maintenance wasn't good due to the crowd. The staff was cool and not so friendly but serve everything quicky. When we did our orders, they told us we needed to wait for 20 mins for our Bingsu, but it took us only about 10 mins. Their Bingsu menu is various and most flavors look super appealing. We had Matcha Black Sesame Bingsu (Large, $16) which was a perfect combination for us, my husband loves Matcha and I love Sesame. The bingsu was so delicious, refreshing and creamy with great portion & plenty of ingredients. The balance of matcha & sesame is good and not too sweet. They also serve Korean boxed sandwich from Semicolon Cafe, which is one of our favorite cafes in Jersey City, New Jersey."
4172,"My favorite bingsoo place hands down!We came on a Saturday afternoon, and it was pretty crowded. Thankfully, we were able to find a seat, and the bingsoo came out after about 5-10 minutes. The matcha strawberry one was tasted as good as it looked! The large looked intimidating at first, but it wasn't as heavy as I expected it to be. It comes with white chocolate sauce which added extra sweetness which was needed; i felt like there wasn't enough matcha and strawberry sauce so the extra white chocolate sauce added more flavor. There was different textures from the cornflakes and mochi which was fun! Also, sometimes stores use unripe fruit which is disappointing, the strawberries they added were ripe and sweet. but the I will definitely be coming back to try their other flavors as well as their drinks."
4173,My friends and I passed this place on the street and had to stop by for one of their cute drinks. We also decided last minute to try their bingsoo. We loved they offered a smaller size option and it was the perfect amount for a midday snack. They only thing we wish for was a little more liquid whether it was the matcha sauce or condensed milk toward the middle and bottom of the cup. All of the wonderful flavors were concentrated on the top.
4174,"This place use to be way better in the beginning. I went on a Friday night and it wasn't too busy. The place now looks more dingy and dark than before and the set up of the tables with the cages were really weird. I ordered just a small matcha cheesecake shaved iced because many things were sold out but I was not informed until I tried ordering. I kindly asked the cashier what her recommendations are and she answered with ""I don't know, I don't really like matcha like that"" and I said okay?? I felt a lack professionalism from her but it could be because of her young age and/or lack of training.I got my order after 5-7 minutes and the matcha cheesecake shaved iced tasted good. It was filling to me and enough to satisfy my cravings. But I couldn't really concentrate on talking to my friend while eating because the cashier was having a very loud conversation in mandarin with her friend that was sitting across at the caged tables. Sadly,  I don't think I would return to this place because of the employees. Maybe we need to re train them. But overall, I gave this place a 3 star strictly for the matcha cheesecake shaved ice, if I could rate service and professionalism, it'll be 1 star and I am being generous."
4175,"Love this bingsoo place! I prefer this to Grace Street which is popular in ktown. Their shaved ice style is different, with sweet moment's being more light and fluffy like eating snow.We got the mango and cheesecake milk shaved ice. Definitely a big portion you can share with 2-3 people and feel full. It is a super refreshing dessert perfect for hot summers in the city. I liked all the hidden treasures it came with including cornflakes, condensed milk, cheesecake bites, and mochi. Only wish the mango was a bit sweeter!"
4176,"The bingsoo is so good here! Seriously in love with this place. I was in New York for one week and literally visited this place three times in my one week stay. If I lived in New York, I would definitely be a regular. You guys should really open one up in LA!My favorite to get is the mango bingsoo, it is just so good. I got this one on all three visits. It's their best flavor! I also tried the watermelon bingsoo which was really refreshing, I would also recommend this one. The strawberry matcha bingsoo was OK but I wouldn't get it again, so probably wouldn't recommend that flavor. I also love how they have a smaller size, so you can try multiple flavors of bingsoo without ordering a large."
4177,"Sweet Moment will truly create come sweet memories. I literally can't get over how cute this dessert shop is! Hidden on the edge of little Italy and Chinatown it packed full of surprises. Staff is pretty good and getting my order wasn't too long. Everything was sweet and tasty. A bit on the more expensive side, but really worth it."
4178,Super delicious and service was great! Cute aesthetic as well. The sandwich was my fav
4179,"I came here with a friend of mine to enjoy a nice dessert spontaneously. We got the large Matcha Black Sesame Bingsoo to share, and it was PERFECT. Matcha and Black Sesame flavors are some of my flavors and they work so well together. My friend and I absolutely destroyed this beautiful piece of artwork in the matter of minutes. Compared to Grace Street, the shaved ice is fluffier and lighter, more akin to the Bingsoo I loved in LA. This dessert shop is heavily underrated and deserves more love!!On a side note, this place has weird hours during COVID and can close early sometimes. Other than that, love this place!"
4180,"I don't have a daughter but I can imagine what fun we would have together at a dessert spot like this. It's cuteness overload. The interior is spacious with several seating areas, each with a K-Pop decor. Their drink and dessert creations are colorful and will surely make you smile with delight. There are photograph booklets at the counter for you to look through before you decide what you want to order. Personally, I think that just makes it harder because everything looks insanely good. Here is what we ordered from their Special Drink menu:- Creamart Chocolate- Creamart Red Velvet- Creamart MatchaYou choose your flavor and then either milk tea or coffee with it. We were told that it was served cold and that there is no option for making it hot. OMG, the latte artwork on these Creamart drinks are ADORABLE...make sure to snap some photos for your IG, FB or SnapChat before you take that first ""Sweet Moment"" creamy, delicious sip. The flavors were subtle, though I think it could have been more pronounced. Nonetheless, I loved it. I could have easily drank all three, the cups are small. Great place to chill and hang.Service was friendly and helpful! Please note: Street parking is $5 for 1 hour"
4181,"This is already one of my new favorite places. The interior is nice; white brick with plants, wood and black accents, very trendy. The prices are fair for a specialty dessert in Manhattan, staff was helpful walking us through the menu, and the little binder with pictures/ingredients of the waffles and bingsoo was super helpful. The bathroom was clean and the key was easily accessible. On a summery Thursday evening a handful of the inside tables were occupied but it wasn't super busy, and the volume inside was comfortable. Overall I was reminded a little of Grace Street in Ktown, but the vibe is much more chill, and the shaved snow you'd get at Grace Street has a different consistency. When we're a little more post-pandemic I can definitely see myself splitting a few bingsoo with a small group of friends or relaxing solo with a book/laptop and a latte. There are three or four little tables outside, we ordered at the counter and brought our food outside. I had the large matcha black sesame bingsoo ($16, the smaller size is $8) - so good!!! Red bean as one of the toppings helped make the dish a bit filling, and the tower of shaved milk ice held it's shape for a surprisingly long time while I chipped away away it. Will definitely be back to try the other flavors, my friend had black sesame red bean and it looked amazing."
4182,"Ackkk I been lacking posting up food porn well more like dessert porn . This dessert spot on Chinatown one block away from little Italy is a best spot to have a quiet time to yourself or mingle with friends.  A good variety of desserts from bingsu to dessert waffles and art milk tea. Of course I end up getting a large tiramisu bingsu and my girlfriend got a small watermelon bingsu. The other days I got my usual order small mango bingsu and a matcha milk tea art.  Some might wonder what is Bingsu well it's. A traditional dessert in Korea, Bingsu It typically consists of chopped fruit, condensed milk, small pieces of tteok (rice cake), chewy jelly bits, and cereal flakes. #dessertporn #dessertheaven #sweettooth #foodie #chinatownnyc #chinatowneats #desserts #instagram_pic #Instagramable #koreandessert #bingsu #tiramisu #watermelonlovers #mangolovers #goodeats #summerweather #summerdesserts #dessert_nyc"
4183,"Cute cafe in Chinatown with a variety of asian flavored desserts, such as matcha and black sesame. My personal favorite is the tiramisu bingsoo! It's creamy with the shaved ice and contains lady fingers and brownie pieces. They are also known for their latte art, with adorable faces. The desserts are reminiscent of something you would get in a Korean cafe. They also have sweet and savory waffles and sandwiches from what I remember. The only part that isn't super great is that the prices are a bit expensive - a cup of bingsoo costs $8 USD and the plate is $16.On the bright side, the cup is easy to take with you to go, especially during covid times. I've been here once before the pandemic, and it was quite a nice to sit in and catch up with a friend or get some work done."
4184,"The bingsoo and coffee here is delicious! The service was average however; there was an issue with the customer in front of me which took almost 15 minutes to resolve, and yet the other barista did not take my order while I was waiting, even though they were free."
4185,Cute and a nice place to go for coffee. The space has a lot of seats. The milk based shaved ice was a little dry in the middle and the cream it ice cream top did not have much flavor to it.
4186,"My favorite shaved ice place in New York City--and the country, to be honest--Sweet Moment is a very cute cafe located right between Chinatown and SoHo. I've come many times to try their wide selection of shaved ice (bingsoo) and tried their waffles last time, and I have not been disappointed yet.For those who haven't heard of shaved ice, think about the consistency of ice cream, but instead of milk and cream, it's made out of ice shavings. It's nothing like water ice; it's 10x better. 5x better than your average snow cone, though you're getting warmer with that. They are able to flavor the super fine and delicate ice shavings with different types of syrup that they are able to create a wide array of different flavors. My personal favorites are the cheesecake flavors, with the little add-ons they put on to mimic the crust and other aspects of typical cheesecake. They add small gummies and fruit to the other flavors, so honestly go with your gut. Every flavor is just as good as the other one. You literally cannot go wrong with bingsoo at Sweet Moment.The waffles weren't my cup of tea, though they were still good. I like to have a hearty breakfast, so the waffles were a bit of a change of pace for me. As for the interior decor, it's a shame that indoor dining protocols are preventing full capacity because it's beautifully decorated. The tables are bunched too close together, and there is plenty of space to spread out and take a break if you've been out and about all day. It's located in a very central part of Chinatown, so there's plenty of other delicacies and must-see locations if you're visiting town for the day.A must-stop dessert location in NYC, Sweet Moment never fails to impress, and I couldn't recommend their bingsoo more!"
4187,"My favorite dessert place in Chinatown. Good amount of seating indoors, first come first serve. Convenient, consistently delicious, and a nice place to hang out with friends over dessert. Order, give your name, find seats and wait to be called. Utensils are conveniently placed.First time here you got to get the bingsoo- it's different from any other place. The ice tastes like sweet shaved milk snow, with a scoop of ice cream, and toppings like fruit and cookies and candy. My favorites have to be the matcha cheesecake, strawberry/mango cheesecake, and black sesame red bean. The flavor combinations go so well together and the large portions ($16) are lovely to share between 2-3 people. The small portion ($8) is very generous for one person. Also very photogenic and colorful. Quite sweet but paired with the milky ice, it's perfect. Affordable, generous sizes.They also have lattes, and other drinks. There's pastries, puddings, waffles, etc. Definitely get the bingsoo."
4188,"We visited here a few times during this trip. I remember it from my last visit and liked it a lot. Last time had taro milk tea which I liked. This time had melon bingsoo, mango cheesecake, and the black sesame red bean. They were all good but I think the melon and black sesame were my fave. Also grabbed brunch another day-the bulgogi sandwich. Loved it!This place has already been determined to be a required stop every time we visit!"
4189,"A cute dessert cafe. Tried the tiramisu shaved ice and the ice was definitely very delicately shaved with a nice texture. I was surprised it wasn't overly sweet as well. All in all okay, but not memorable or good enough to repeatedly go back for."
4190,"The cutest!!! Absolutely in love with the presentation of the shaved ice. Comes with melon balls, scoop of ice cream (unique flavor), waffle straw, macaron, mint leaf LOL, bingsoo ice, condensed milk, mochi, cereal at the bottom! We totally didn't know there was cereal at the bottom until we reached it. Might've tasted better all mixed.The melon balls are literally just melon so that was refreshing and delicious. Love that the fruit was cold. The shaved ice itself was OK. A little bland bc the condensed milk is the only added flavor. Didn't like the ice cream, we took it out. Macaron was delish and waffle straw was decent. Nice location, near Chinatown (I think) BUT it gets really quiet at night. Could be dangerous walking alone to this place so try to come with a friend when it's dark out :)Would come here again but to try something else hopefully as delicious as it looks!"
4191,"This review is for my pre-COVID visits.Sweet Moment is one of my favorite places to go for a nice cup of coffee and to study. There are plenty of small table and two large tables for bigger groups. I love stopping by and sitting close to the window for some natural light while I work.I usually opt for the plain coffee but the menu has some pretty creative options, including the ""Cream Art"" drinks.Their Mango & Cheesecake shaved ice is pretty on point too. It's not super sweet but the cheesecake pieces pairs much better with ice than I thought.There is no internet on the weekends so just keep that in mind if you're planning to come by to get some work done. Definitely recommend!"
4192,Had to give this place 5 stars. The guy who worked there was super nice even though we came in ten minutes before closing. I asked him if it was okay to order stuff because obviously he's gotta get out of there too at some point but he was super cool about it. We ordered the mango cheesecake bingsoo and the chocolate oreo bingo. Both were delicious. Would definitely come back at an earlier time.
4193,"I'd love to give this place 5 stars for the quality of the drinks, desserts, and how the only girl working in this place was just on top of her game running the entire place by herself.I'd also like to give this place 1 star because there was only one person working! I think the owner of this joint was just lingering around watching us wait well over 20 minutes for 3 drinks. Thats pretty absurd, you have a great restaurant thats relatively busy so please hire more people."
4194,The space was very cute. Loved the white brick walls and the wooden table where we sat. Indoor seating is available which was great since it was raining the day I went. The bingsoo was so yummy. Love the layers of different textures and the fruit helped balance out the sweetness. Wasn't the biggest fan of the mochi because it was too sweet for me but I want to try all the bingsoo flavors! The shaved ice part kind of felt like eating snow lol and I'm not sure I loved that because it wasn't flavored but that's why the other layers are there.
4195,"I came here to get Bingsoo and it was delicious. However, the ice did not melt as quickly as we would have liked and it was pretty cold. I think there is not enough matcha or black sesame to the amount of ice that is there. This was outdoor dining which was fine, but the tables don't seem to be cleaned once someone else leaves. It is sit down as you please and go in to order. Also, the distance between tables is definitely not 6ft so if you are worried about other people, I would not recommend you eat here when it is busy. I have been here before the pandemic and this is a place I would recommend more when indoor dining is back. The decor and vibe is a lot better inside. Their outdoor atmosphere is not the same."
4196,"Had their matcha bingsoo & cartoon lattes the last time, but this time I came in to try one of their Instagram popular ones (aka the cute watermelon bingsoos with the cute add-ons that they advertise). We expected it to be HUGE because the cashier said so AND the fact that it cost $20+, but sadly it was like the size of a tiny melon and the taste was interesting to say the least.... I'm sure they were just experimenting or something but it was different from what we were used to and definitely not something we would consider paying $20+ for. The side drizzle they usually give with bingsoo was some sour watermelon(?)/candy flavor and the ice cream was like that flavor you get when you mix every Italian ice together. Also, for those expecting it to have everything you see on Insta, think again, we just had a plain macaron on ours, not even the bear macaron or the wafer stick, strawberry skewer, etc. So basically for $20+ they only give you half a small melon, the ice cream, mochi, the shaved ice, chocolate chips, and a tiny macaron and the taste is ??? You're better off buying something else.Giving a 4 star because I had a great exp before, but my second time here I had a mediocre exp with the food quality."
4197,"The melon bingsoo was more delicious than I expected! There were so many flavors and textures that all worked well together. First of all, the ice wasn't pure ice; it was slightly creamy and probably contained dairy.At the top of the bingsoo was a matcha macaron and a scoop of raspberry ice cream. The macaron was decent but a little too sweet. The ice cream had an acidic undertone, which contrasted well with the other flavors.I wish the melon scoops were more cold; they seemed to be at room temprature.At the bottom of the bingsoo were hidden mochi bits mixed into ice, which was a pleasant chewy surprise. There were also crushed salty corn flakes, which seemed a little out of place, but I appreciated the idea.Overall, I liked the thought that went behind what went into the bingsoo! It was $20 for a large, but that's enough for 2 people. The place is pretty busy which makes it a little hard to get a seat, but it's clean!"
4198,"Loved the cold matcha latte with the cutest art! Also the Nutella strawberry waffle was gorgeously plated and big enough to share!It's definitely a pricey cafe but aren't they all? The presentation and overall taste make it worth a once in a while splurge!Only slight problem was I went with a friend who ordered a mini bingsu and they lost her order. I get that it happens but when I asked one of the servers about it, she quickly brushed me off. She only came back much more politely once she realized there was no order. They then made my friend show her receipt, credit card transaction, etc and then rushed to make it for her. Still would come back! I get accidents happen."
4199,"i love bingsoo so i couldn't stroll through chinatown without it. the matcha strawberry bingsoo is a must get! the matcha has a great bitter taste which compliments the sweetness of the condensed milk poured over. the decor and vibes here are immaculate! perfect date spot imo. two downsides, one was the lack of customer service, the girl cashier looked entirely miserable.two, the bingsoo (large, which looks huge in the picture, was $17) which is an obscene amount of money to be charging bingsoo. when the bingsoo is melted, it's literally milk/cream which doesn't even fill a cup ."
4200,"Wow!!! What a pleasant surprise this restaurant was!Fantastic red wine!Great service! Perfectly seasoned and sized lamb chops!!! Excellent Greek salad and perfect portions!!My only issue was was the tables were a lil too close for my comfort, but I'll certainly be back!"
4201,"The food was insane, probably in top 3 dining experiences I had in NYC so you have to check it out if you like GreekAppetizers: - Octopus - again, this was recommended by Yelp reviewers: they know what they're talking about - 9.3/10- Three Dips - tzatziki, roe dip, eggplant - I'm not sure if it's bc I never had tzatziki at an established restaurant but it blew me away, also the roe dip was wild, both so creamy, left nothing - 9.6/10- Meatballs - very solid, soft and they were large balls -8.8/10- Lamb Chops - can't not get lamb, delicious and the eggplant side was $ - 9.2/10- Pistachio Crusted Stripe w filled w Sheep Cheese - this was the show stopper, I was mind blown, idk what my tastebuds did to deserve this but 10/10"
4202,service greatdecor tables a bit tight togethermeatballs very good probably the best I have had very light zucchini chips very nice thin and crispysoup very good lamb chops goodsteak good but expensive at 40 dollarssalmon would not order again.  It was poached and rolled up on a heap of spinach riceanytime they have something rolled up usually it's not freshly made but heatedit was not a filet - did not finish the dish and it was 28 dollarsnot sure I will be back price may not justify what you getI think the appetizers were the bestremember don't get the salmon .  the lady at the next table also ordered the salmon and did not finish it
4203,Pylos was a pleasant surprise! It is actually one of the best authentic upscale Greek restaurants in New York City but it is still under the radar. They have a very interesting selection of Greek dishes that you don't easily find in other restaurants in the city including pistachio in meat and fish dishes. Their lavraki was excellent and everyone in my party loved their food! We have come in multiple times and the quality of food and service are always memorable! Staff was very polite and the crowd was fun. Highly recommend this place!
4204,Very quaint greek cuisine.    The octopus was to die for.     The lighting is soft.  This would be a great date night place.    There was also a group next to us enjoying themselves.    It was the queens 51st bday my wife.   I would def recommend if you are un The NY
4205,decor on point. their food took me to a flavor town that even the greek gods would come down for...and the service was bomb!!! the only constructive feedback i'd leave would be around giving me n the strangers next door to my table some more elbow room but as u can see that didn't subtract any stars se efcharisto!
4206,"Wow! This place is great. Came here for dinner on a Friday evening and was very pleasantly surprised. Ambiance (5/5): Looks like you're entering a Mediterranean villa. Decor is all on point and quite spacious. Love the layout. Ceiling has a cool collection of what appears to be terracotta vases. Food (5/5): Food was excellent. Try the houloumi! Was really taken by how good this was. The grapes were a great accompaniment. We also ordered the fish which was nicely cooked though could've used some saltService (5/5): The waitstaff were all excellent and answered all questions. They were very knowledgeable about the menu and provided excellent suggestions. Overall, this place lives up to the hype. Had a great experience and will be back!"
4207,Came here on a date night.  I must start buy saying the places interior decoration is beautiful.  Makes you want to take many pics inside.So we were seated inside on a Saturday night and the place was full.  The orders were taken and came out relatively quick.  We ordered the following:Moussaka: 3.5/5PITAKIA KAISARIAS 3/5PAIDAKIA GALAKTOS STIN SCHARA ME IMAM KAI MORA PATATES (lamb ribs) 4/5Overall their was food was good and the service was great too.  I would come here again and try their seafood
4208,"This is a great dining option in the east village. It's classy, beautifully decorated with a great dining menu and a wine list. I called the day before to make a reservation for 3 without any issues. We were seated inside and felt well separated from the other patrons. The seats were comfortable. The ambiance was perfect with dim lighting. I couldn't even remember if there was music playing in the background as I could hear and enjoy my friends' company.We started out with a bottle of red that our waiter chose for us after hearing what we were thinking about for dinner. It paired well! I think it was the bottle of axis. We split the three dip that came with super warm pita bread. Like at Taboon, my favorite was the fish dip, then the eggplant. My friend for the scallop app which he really liked and the other got the lamb chops, which were so good! I'm usually not a fan of lamb but I think that is the dish to get here. I'll try the lamb shank next time! I ended up getting the shrimp and scallop over greek noodles which came in a delicious creamy sauce. The noodles were a bit soggier than I would like but still very delicious. We shared a dessert which also came recommended to us. It was light but tasty with hints of cherries throughout."
4209,"Wow, what a find! We arrived at this restaurant at about 9pm on a Monday night. The host informed us that the kitchen closed at 9:30pm but they would be more than happy to seat us. The restaurant was nearly empty. The ambience was fantastic. Beautiful interior with dim lights, perfect for a date night! Our server greeted us right away and explained the menu and offered suggestions. We ordered the appetizer trio dip, the green village salad, lemon potatoes, and the Branzino. The trio dip arrived quickly. The portion of dip/pita bread was enough to feed about 6 people. This was the one thing that we ordered that we thought was just okay. Pro tip: ask for sliced cucumbers to dip instead of bread if you are trying to save room for your entree! The Greek village salad was incredible. The contents were so fresh and the dressing was to die for! The Branzino arrived with a side of olive oil/lemon sauce for dipping. We found that we didn't even need to use this dipping sauce because the fish was delicious on its own. It was tender and cooked to perfection. The lemon potatoes are a must. They are flavorful yet still crispy. The service was 5 star. They repeatedly refilled our waters without having to ask. The server was diligent and polite. All in all, this place was a fabulous find and I would highly recommend it to anyone!"
4210,"I don't think I've ever had Greek food like this-  Wow, everything was so delicious. Authentic in a high end, well presented way. The restaurant is classy and very warm. The service is stellar. The menu is a bit hard to navigate if you are unfamiliar with Greek food but it's hard to go wrong with your order. The Greek wine list was fun to explore. This is not the kind of food I would have all the time (there is a ton of cheese and fried dough and it was delightful but also heavy) but as far as unique experiences and delicious fun, this is a must try in the city."
4211,"We came here for Valentine's day and had a reservation at 6pm, 2 days after indoor dining returned: you would think they were prepared. Despite the 25% capacity inside we tried to order 3 dishes and every time the answer was: we are out of that dish... Needless to say I really must have enjoyed the food to give this restaurant five stars anyways. The 3 dips as an appetizer were super fresh and delicious.The branzino was amazing and the side of roasted potatoes was also super flavorful. Everything cooked in olive oil so very clean (watch out for some of the dishes that are not cooked in olive oil but canola).I can't wait to come back and hopefully have what they didn't have last time."
4212,"So! Freaking! Good! Service is impeccable, ambiance is airy and romantic, and food is delectable. A great first date spot, and a great choice for all Mediterranean foodies of the like! Their red blend / wine list is spectacular and well thought out, their lamb chops (plus their stuffed eggplant) is to die for, and their Greek salad is the stuff of dreams. Highly recommend. The waitstaff, hostess (Kia!!) make you feel warm and welcome, and service was beyond amazing throughout the night."
4213,"Upscale Greek restaurant great for dates with a romantic and classy ambience, extensive wine list, excellent service, and well-prepared and delicious dishes.I went to Pylos for a Saturday lunch with a friend and was sat down immediately with no reservation. The menu features lighter egg-based dishes for brunch on the weekends, but I opted for the shrimp appetizer (garides ouzo; high teens price range) and the braised lamb shank (low 30s price range) as my entree in addition to the free warmed pita bread that is given to every table. All of the food was really well presented and well prepared. I could not ask for more on the service - our server constantly checked in on us, had great knowledge of the wine list, switched out our plates regularly, and recommended an alternative lamb dish on the dinner menu during lunchtime when they were out of a different dish. The decor is as beautiful as their food - rustic, clean, charming and classy.If you want a more upscale restaurant with great Greek cuisine to show someone or a group of people a good time, Pylos is the way to go!"
4214,This was one of the nicest places I've been to in a while. The food was great. The service perfection. Definitely will I'm go back. And when your Greek boss recommends it you listen!! And man am I glad I did.  The pictures done explain how cute this place is.
4215,"Went to pylos on a Sunday night, not too crowded was sat right away. Me and the girlfriend started off with a bottle of red blend from Greece I cannot remember the name off but it was very good! The trio dip: very good must get app. Warm pita bread on the side enough to feed 6 ppl. I got the lamb chops which were very good!! Cooked perfectly and the potatoes to go along with it were very flavorful She got the pastisio, we've had our fare share of this dish and I must say this was top 3 The server was very attentive and knowledgeable"
4216,"Ordered delivery via Caviar and had a great experience. The Taramasalata and horiatiki were both as amazing as I remember, and moussaka was decent but I think I'll stick to the lamb dishes in terms of entrees. Next time: I want to try the pastitsio!"
4217,"Made me wait outside while my table was ready for seating. That is a failure of decency and accommodation.Food was fine. Good Greek food. Nothing exceptional. Waiting service was notably thoughtful and charismatic. Decent ambiance. Not in a rush to come back, but don't regret going either."
4218,"THE BABY LAMBCHOPS ARE A DREEEEAAAMMMOur second time at Pylos and we did not think it could top our first visit - but it did. Would give this place 100 stars if we could. We are always blown away by how delicious, flavorful, perfect every dish always is. And the wine selection always on point and reasonably priced. We L O V E Pylos. As you may have guessed the lambchops totally our favorite. We went with a group of 6 tonight and we all vowed on our return visit we will each get our own plate of lambs. Perfectly charred containing amazingly soft, seasoned and fatty meat. Each of us blissfully gnawed off every piece on the bone. Ugh. So good. (Oh and the caramelized onions and roasted eggplant that were on the plate we also phenomal) Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. We ordered a ton of other food everything amazing. But I'm about to pass out b/c the food coma is hitting me so I'll try my best to list to foods here: saganaki, zucchini with tzaziki, pasta with shrimp and scallops, pistachio crusted stripe bass, the cured beef with arugula, pear and cheese, the phyllo pastry... Im sure there is more but just wanted to say everything list above - effin great! Last thing: do not skip dessert. Even if you are full. Huge mistake. Both Phyllo desserts were INSANE - one was a warm wrapped pastry with honey the second was a layered Napoleon with greek yogurt and sour cherry - heeeeaaavveeen. And the chocolate mouse was also ammmazing. Also I'm not sure if we had a chance to really thank him but Nikos our server was truly kind and hospitable - and made our delicious meal so so enjoyable. The service also 100 stars. Thank you, Nikos."
4219,"After 2 years we were able to go back to one of our favorite restaurants, and we chose Mother's Day.They were very nice in accommodating us to have our usual table my Mother-in-law loves.Space in between tables is very well observed, with screens in between.Staff is very kind and helpful, and the food is simply delicious, as always.We had an amazing time!"
4220,"What a hidden gem I found. I was craving greek food and this place was on my bookmark for a long time, so I decided to dine in with my friend. I feel like this place is more classier than Souvlaki GR and any other greek restaurants I have been to in NYC.we ordered;1. roasted beets filled with feta mousse for appetizer - 5/5 (I do not like beets or feta cheese.. but highly recommend this dish)2. baby lamb chops - 4/5 meat was perfectly cooked, but it was a bit bland3. shrimp and sea scallops in tomato sauce - 4/5. I wish the pasta was long. it was only 2-3inches long. idk why..? but the favor was amazing.They also serve warm pita and their version of a hummus to start. It was really delicious and I wanted to take them home lol. service was attentive, price is affordable. I will definitely come back when I crave greek food."
4221,"I was never particularly a big fan of Greek food but this place changed my mind. I had an outdoor dining experience with friends, and the food here made my venture into the cold new york night worthwhile. The outdoor dining setup is rather on the simpler side - with a tent and some heating lamps inside. It is a shame that indoor dining is not open yet because the interior of the restaurant looks so chic,  I will come back after covid to experience dining inside here. Food is definitely the highlight of the night. For appetizer we ordered Moussaka and Pastitsio - i think this is two very similar dishes, one cooked with a potato base and one with pasta base. Both are great but Moussaka is the winner in my mind. The fried eggplant and zucchini is also super delicious - for a person who usually hates eggplant, i have to admit i love this dish.For main course, we ordered the lamp chop. What a show stopper! It is cooked to perfection: medium rare and melts in the mouth. Definitely would recommend. Server here are super friendly and attending, and they recommended great greek wine that matched perfectly with our food (also never tried greek wine and it is not bad at all)."
4222,"Cute cozy-ish (ish because its actually quite spacious inside) greek spot in east villageWe tried:- poikilia 6/10: aka the three dips. I really liked the fish one but i prefer a thinner/lighter tzatziki and the eggplant one was very bland- afrata keftedakia 7/10: meatballs were decent but were they really worth it..i dont know. It lacked a bit of flavor so i found myself combining forces with the dips above- moussaka 9/10: now this i really enjoyed. It was a solid portion and i could really taste the different ingredients- lamb chops 7/10: its not that they didn't taste good, it just wasn't great -- which is really what you should be aiming for if youre eating lamb chops outside. I had read somewhere that the lamb here was really delicious so we were disappointed with the lack of flavor (and also had asked for rare but got more of a medium rare) All in all everything was slightly pricier than i wouldve liked and food was a little bland all around."
4223,I came here about 5 years ago and had the ouzo shrimp appetizer. I think about this shrimp at least once a week. I don't normally eat octopus but the one here was so mild and cooked so well that I actually enjoyed it. But it's all about the amazing shrimp here
4224,"I've been coming to Pylos for a few years now and I can confidently say they offer the best Greek food in NYC. Not only is the interior beautiful and charming, the food is ALWAYS solid.  Great for date nights, group dinners, and business meetings. I have compiled a list of recommended dished down below along with prices. Recommendations:-Greek salad $19 (Fresh feta, tomatoes, cucumbers, and capers)-Octopus $22 (Grilled to perfection served with balsamic reduction sauce)-Pork Shank $30 (Braised with lemon and herbs)-Beet Salad $14 (Simple but glorious)KEEP IN MIND*No beer or hard liqour. (Red, white, and sparkling wine available)*Street parking available right across the street."
4225,"Oh. my. goodness. This place is spectacular. From the service to the food to the decor (which I did not photograph ..*face palm*)..just amazing. AmbianceIt has such a warm, cozy but intimate feel to it. I'd say perfect for dates, business meetings or just catching up with a girlfriend.ServiceI was met my the hostess outside which brought me in and seat me immediately. Unfortunately I had to wait a very long time for one of my girlfriends to come but they were really accommodating. Our waiter Anastasio (I believe his name was) was so personable. FoodEverything was so flavorful and fresh. We ordered the Afrata Keftedakia (greek meatballs) and the saganaki tou merakli (three amazing cheese melted on a small iron plater). Firstly our waiter kept recommending it and we listened to him and just wow. That was literally what we kept saying the entire time we ate it. Its THAT good. For our main course I ordered the salmon and my girlfriend ordered the lamb shank. Both were very good. The lamb shank was so tender and fell off the boneI would definitely come back!"
4226,Incredible Greek food in an awesome location. Dolomades and avgolemono is divine. The interior is exquisitely decorated. Highly recommend!
4227,Delicious - one of my favorite in the East Billage. Great atmosphere and authentic Greek food just like when we were in Greece.
4228,"After reading some of the reviews I promptly hopped on Opentable and snagged a last minute reservation. This little strip of 4th ave has some really excellent restaurants. Pylos was my first endeavor in elevated greek food and based on my experience here it definitely won't be my last. I struggled to choose between the Saganaki Tou Merakli  and Haloumi. The description for the saganaki won me over. How can you say no to three greek cheeses melted in a clay pot? So simple, tangy, and rich. Definitely save the fresh pita served on the house to pair with this. Although the complimentary hummus is great as well. We split the moussaka and baby lamb chops as mains which was the go to move because man, moussaka is filling. The star of the show was by far the lamb chops. The chops were so tender and meaty without that gamey after taste. While the moussaka is a comforting, filling dish, it felt like something we could make at home.For dessert, you can't go wrong with the galaktoboureko. It's crunchy, flaky, creamy, and topped with Greek mountain honey. SO good!This review is way overdue since we visited back in February. One main downside is being seated in the front during the winter. The front of the house kept swinging open the curtain which let in bitter NYC air. Aside from that, I highly recommend Pylos if you're looking for a cute new spot in the East Village."
4229,"Always love Pylos, the vibe was always great. Sat at the communal/bar table and thought it was a great idea and pleasant experience. Tomato Shrimp was absolutely delicious, perfect cooked tomato sauce hugged the fresh shrimp oh my yummmm. Whole Fish Branzino was tasty but nothing special like other places, maybe I should have ordered more of their signature dishes. Spinach Rice was also pretty good. Great selection of wine, we truly enjoyed."
4230,Wow what a world. Our table of five split five appetizers and three lamb plates. Arthur was extremely helpful in picking out a wine that would compliment the meal perfectly. The food was amazing and flavorful and the service was spectacular. Even the  busboy was super attentive and always topping off our waters. Much love and appreciation.
4231,Greek restaurant on lower east village. Had the horiatiki salad moussaka and the lamb chops everything was perfect
4232,"I tried Pylos on a whim on a Saturday night after hearing rave reviews and must say it's some of the best Greek food I've ever had in NYC, and probably the best Greek restaurant in Manhattan. It has a rustic ambiance with hundreds of clay pots hanging from the ceiling, pillow lined booths and white washed walls reminiscent of Santorini. Seemed like there was a mix of people there of all ages, and for all occasions from birthdays to first dates. It was packed but wasn't a pretentious, sceney crowd, which I appreciate.It's located on East 7th right before Tompkins Square Park on one of the most bustling streets in the Village. We called the morning of to make a last minute reservation and luckily they were able to take us. When we arrived at 8pm, we were seated right away. After placing our order, we received a generous portion of homemade pita. It was served warm, wrapped in a napkin to prevent it from getting cold, alongside a chickpea, vegetable spread.We stuck to mostly appetizers sharing the following:* horiatiki - their classic Greek salad with tomatoes so fresh and juicy you'd think they were flown in from Greece* kolokythakia - crispy zucchini and eggplant batter fried rounds, served with tzatziki. these are a MUST order. as one who normally doesn't care for tzatziki, I was surprised how much I liked theirs, I believe they must've used whipped feta and forewent the sour cream, it was so rich and creamy and had a refreshing hint of dill. * htapothi scharas - nice hearty piece of octopus in a delicious balsamic reduction* paidakia - grilled baby lamp chops served with potatoes and stuffed baby eggplants. again, these are a MUST order. four comes in an order so plenty as an entree or to share. they're so tender and juicy, we're so glad we went with our server's recommendation to order them medium rare - we did not find them to be undercooked at all. also, the stuffed baby eggplant is so good it should be on the menu in itself! it's roasted to perfection with the skin nearly falling off and is filled with tomatoes, onions that compliments the smokiness of the eggplantThe service was stellar, our waitress was lovely, very attentive, and knowledgeable on the menu. She recommended a perfect pairing  for a white wine. Keep in note they only serve Greek wine, no hard alcohol, which furthers the authenticity of the experience in my opinion.I so enjoyed my experience at Pylos that I'm still thinking about my meal the day after! I feel it is fully deserving of 5 stars, and I feel so fortunate that I live in the neighborhood because I can't wait to go back!"
4233,"One of my favorite restaurants with delicious food that has consistent quality! I love their lamb shank. I really hope that they will bring back the pork shank, which is also my favorite dish."
4234,"It's a very good restaurant. The decorations are incredible. The hanging pots on the ceiling are very unique and charming. The place is full of Mediterranean elements. I really like it.The food is great. The bread comes with hummus and it's very good. We ordered meatballs and fried zucchini and eggplants. Both are very good. Meat balls are not really light as air though lol. For main course, I can't tell you the name of the dishes but they were great. I loved my seafood pasta. My friend loved his food too. The portion here is huge. We were stuffed when we finished. Service is great too. Friendly and courteous waiters here. However they don't have cocktails here, which is a bummer. Overall I like the restaurant quite a bit. Lamb looks amazing and I'll definitely want to try that next time. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone who loves Greek food."
4235,"Greek salad plz. Ordered from here a week ago when I was bed ridden from a surgery. It's authentic just like I had in Mykonos, Naxos and Santorini. No lettuce or anything in their salads, just pure flavor. Chunks of feta. Love it. But can you please add more kalamata olives? I got like, 2. My mom got 1. Seriously, 3 olives in two salads. At least give a girl some proper proportion if you're charging what you are haha. Probably not intention and just an oversight. No one is perfect so of course I'll be back :-) Salad is pricey but it's NYC so you just gotta do it. Love this place overall. Happy happy :) also found it on Yelp. How else does anyone find anything legitimate anyway?"
4236,"Came on a friends recommendation and it was excellent. Food was delicious and service impeccable and the waiter's suggestions were appreciated. We had eggplant with feta, caramelized onions and tomato sauce appetizer ; shrimp and scallops over egg noodles in an ouzo tomato and cream sauce; and striped bass with a pistachio crust layered over thin zucchini slices. All tasty and well prepared. Also an unusual though somewhat pricy Greek wine, and an excellent desert of triangles of phyllo dough filled with a semolina custard and drizzled with honey, and of course Greek coffee."
4237,"Was very excited to try this spot. Unimpressed to say the least. Staff and service was the best part. It's a very tight spot. Tables are very small. I felt so cramped eating the whole time. The food was OK. Actually, we left half the food uneaten and it was over $200 for 2 people. There are much better Greek spots in the city where I would have enjoyed my meal a lot more for a lot less money."
4238,"Finally came here for dinner the other week with friends. Made a reservation ahead of time. We ordered a variety of dishes to share and a bottle of white wine. Appetizer: -grilled octopus (saw many pictures of this and great reviews and decided to try it. Didn't disappoint! just wished the portion was bigger especially since we were sharing amongst 4 people. Should've ordered 2 of these, but definitely recommend trying this)-3 cheese dipping sauceentrees:-shrimp & scallop pasta-lamb shank-grilled fish-pork shankGot to try a little bit of each dish. Everything was quite delicious and the portions were great.And love the pots on the ceiling. Quite interesting. Left full and satisfied with the food. Can't wait to come back and try other food on the menu."
4239,"I came here with my fiancé for Valentines Day and the food was delicious! We ordered the Pastitsio and the organic boned chicken farci with raisins, rosemary, thyme and greek kasseri cheese, served with briam. The Pastitsio was so good! I originally wanted to order the Anginares Moussaka or regular Moussaka but they were completely out both dishes. I was disappointed at first but the Pastitsio and service made up for it. I highly recommend this place."
4240,"Enjoyed the spanakorizo and maroulosalata (simple green salad), but didn't love the meatballs. They were a bit oily and didn't pack the same flavor punch I remember. The spanakorizo was very flavorful and filling--highly recommend. I also loved how light and fresh the salad tasted, even via delivery. Next time I'll skip the meatballs!"
4241,"Came here on a date with my boyfriend. We take out from here all the time but he hadn't yet eaten at Pylos in person. Completely COVID friendly and food is UNBELIEVABLE as always (we got the 3 dips, halloumi, and horiatiki salad--all so delicious, but especially the taramasalata. It's the best in the city). Service is exceptional, too. I cannot recommend this place enough!"
4242,"On a Sunday night, I came here as a group of 5. The ambience is romantic.  Now the food: - octupus - charred with great texture and seasoning. - baby lamb rack - I had a bite of this and it was medium done. Nicely spiced. - whole brazino: loved this. Nice moisture and not dry. They also did a good job cleaning it before serving - pear salad with arugula and goat cheese: goat cheese was fresh and the dressing was mild. Great as an appetizer- Greek salad - feta cheese and tomatoes were good."
4243,"In short: been there three times. The honey braised lamb shank is mind blowing awesome, the delicate meat pairs with more solid roasted veggies. The Greek salad - don't know what they do to it - is great too. So simple, yet so yummy. Will go there soon again."
4244,"Lovely ambience. Good food. Nice service. A bit pricey.Portions are generous. The poikilia was superb as was the bronzini, as was the christos' towering galaktobourekakia for dessert which is not to be missed. I would probably skip the horiatiki salad.Should I go back I would have an appetizer followed by dessert (I'm not a big eater).Unfortunately, I'm still searching for the holy grail (a NYC restaurant where quiet conversation can take place). Tables here are close together and the noise level is on the loud side."
4245,"The one star is strictly for their customer service.  If you can't get both: good service + good food then it's a complete fail.  I can cook a good meal in my own home, but I go out to have fun and be pampered and if I can't get both then what is the point! Stay away.  You can find a lot more good places in the city with friendly service.  In short: my girlfriends and I came here based on a google recommendation.  We show up and they tell us it'll be about an hour, so we walk across the street to get a drink since we couldn't sit at the bar here and no available tables. They call us, and we literally miss the call by one minute and they had already gave up our table.  We tried to reason with them and their reply is ""based on our statistics, we can't hold the table for more than one minute because it'll be a no show"".  It took him more time to argue about the fact that he can't wait for more than one minute to give up our table than to actually just seat us!! And for the record the table they had for us was still paying their check when we got there, but still decided to seat others."
4246,"Already can't wait to come back! Each dish was better than the next! We had Greek salad, artichoke moussaka, shrimp, meatballs, baked cheese...all was so flavorful.  The service was great! We sat outside which was fun because the street is really vibrant, but the inside looks lovely too.  Highly recommend!"
4247,"Outrageously delicious. We had the artichoke moussaka, the salad, and the trio of dips as takeout. It was all exceptional. Can't wait to go back. They have a beautiful outdoor dining area set up for safe Covid eating."
4248,"I came here to eat lunch with my mom.We had the fried calamari. It came with a really delicious sauce. The sauce was a little spicy and creamy.We also shared the spinach puff pastry. I'd recommend getting the calamari over the spinach puff pastry, but if you're a fan of cheese, get the puff pastry.I had the moussaka and it was so good. The cheese on top was melted and gooey and the meat sauce was very savory and flavorful.My mom ordered the lamb chops. It was good. She ordered the fries on the side. The fries were just okay.This place has quality olive oil. The olive oil that was served with the freshly baked and warm pita bread was very rich.Overall, such a great place to dine. The interior is also very chic!"
4249,I love pylos!!! Such a cute restaurant with delicious food.Very cozy in the back which is where I sat with my friend.This spot is definitely so cool how the present the salmon. It was in three rolls. Cooked so well and combined with rice was SO GOOD.
4250,"Ordered from here a few days ago and thought the food was okay. I recently had some dental work, so I have been forced to eat soft foods. That said, I opted for the mac & cheese and mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes were pretty good. They come with gravy, but I'm glad I ordered extra gravy on the side. There definitely wasn't enough in the single serving. There was a good amount of flavor but it didn't really stand out to me. Sad to report the mac & cheese was pretty bland. There wasn't enough flavor so I had to season it myself at home. Would probably not order this again."
4251,"My favorite spot in the city. It doesn't matter if you are a vegan, everyone can enjoy the food. My all time favorite is the mango chicken dish with brown rice. And OMG their hot tea!! I have been going to Red Bamboo for years and they have always give great service. Even now during the pandemic, they are so friendly and go out of their way to make ordering and picking up so pleasant. I wish I lived closer but I still make the 20 minute ride over there cuz it's that good"
4252,"A great restaurant for vegetarians, appetizers and entrees are all great, honestly. The ambiance is chill, and the space is a bit on the small side but that's expected in nyc."
4253,Wow I was so happy to see this place is open 21 years later ! I brought my friend and she didn't think she'd like it well her food is gone! No e Tra seasonings needed still delicious ! Thanks so much
4254,"I loved going to a restaurant where I could order anything on the menu, guilt-free! It's a vegan heaven with sooo many options, and located in a great neighborhood. We got a table for 2 on a Wednesday night right away without reservations, but by ~6:30pm the place was pretty packed. It actually got quite noisy being such a small restaurant that it was kinda hard to hear each other. My only other tip is to limit the amount of ""chicken"" dishes you order - we split the wings and then I got the cashew chicken myself - both tasted amazing but I could not eat that much of the same thing, it was so heavy! In hindsight I would have done ""chicken"" for only one, and a veggie or tofu based dish for the other."
4255,"I'm a carnivore but my kid is vegetarian so we went here for lunch. Tiny place, but nice. Best fake chicken I have ever had. If I lived near this place I could be a happy vegan."
4256,"If you're vegan, try the food. If you're not vegan, still try the food !I wish I would of known of this place when i lived in NYC ! The food was soo good. For starters, I had the BBQ buffalo wings and popcorn shrimp. The bbq buffalo wings were delicious ! The sauce was perfect! The popcorn shrimp were good also. Seasoned to perfection!For my main course, I had the sweet & sour chicken with white rice. Loved that also. I only wish they cooked the peppers down more because I love peppers and they were almost raw :( my friend had the mango chicken and he enjoyed that also. I tasted it and it was really good. The mango pieces basically melted in your mouth. I would recommend EVERYONE to try this place even if they aren't vegan. Give the meat a rest for a day but still have some great food. Ill definitely be returning !"
4257,"Great atmosphere, the sweet and sour ""chicken"" was OKAY. Not my favorite won't get that again. The spring rolls were yummmy! And so was the duck sauce . Service was quick and attentive."
4258,"I hadn't ordered in a while, and forgot how delicious the food is here.  I'm not 100% vegetarian BUT I could be if I had this food to eat every day.  This time I ordered the CURRY WINGS and DUMPLINGS.  Both were jam packed with tons of flavor and really tasted even better than if they had meat - truly.  Just deliciously flavorful food - yum!"
4259,"This place is okay. My friend's bourbon fake chicken was good. It was better than my black bean veggies. The black bean dish was so incredibly overseasoned I did not want to eat it at all. It's like they just put a big scoop of black bean sauce and sauteed everything in it which is probably exactly what they did. It tasted like just pure salt water. It was truly one of the saltiest thing I have ever tasted. I didn't wana make a fuss so just ate a little and then left.On the other hand the fake chicken dishes seems to be the forte of this vegan establishment. The bourbon chicken was surprisingly not as salty and was decent. Seemed like everyone else was getting one variant or another of the fake meat dishes.The servers were fine except I was trying to pay and my server was just hiding in the corner towards the kitchen texting the whole time for good ten, fifteen minutes not even looking up. She finally got around and I got to pay but I thought the receipt was a bit distatesful. I don't know if anyone reads it but it says 25% tip = server is the sh*t."
4260,"Where is the Sole on a Roll?! My favorite dish is gone and I am sad. Still, this place is a solid choice for vegan naughtiness. I have been coming here for years and I do believe it has slipped a bit but the fake chicken options do not disappoint, particularly if you are looking for a fried food experience. I avoid the stir fried dishes because I have been disappointed in the past. Instead, what I think Red Bamboo does well is the fake fried stuff.During my most recent visit to Red Bamboo, I ordered the Soul Chicken Sandwich and it was a little bit dry and cut up the inside of my mouth a bit, but there is no denying the pleasure that fatty, fried, fake chicken bestows. I wish this came as a large patty rather than the nuggets which are constantly falling out and making a general mess of things (my hands), but the sandwich has been this way forever so I doubt that is going to change. This place is truly great for vegan comfort food and I hope it never goes away. And I would love for that Sole on a Roll sammie to return!"
4261,Had dinner at The Red Bamboo last night. The spring rolls with zucchini and tofu were well made and had a delicious sweet sauce to compliment it. The Thai beef curry was amazing but I am still trying to figure out what gave it a sweet spicy taste !I wanted to drink the sauce! The Vegan Eggplant Parmigiana was crispy and light. The sauce was so good. The staff was friendly and efficient. Cool place. Highly recommended !!!!!
4262,"This review will be short and quick!  Food was excellent! Service was great, parking is on the street (one way), we were lucky and didn't have to wait for a spot more than five minutes literally in front of the restaurant.  Restaurant is small, tables are so close that my food and drink was almost knocked over (rear end), by a couple trying to be seated, not to appealing to have someone's ""rear"" that close to your face while eating.  Other than that I would have given them five stars.  We enjoyed the experience overall minus the extreme close knit quarters. Our wait time after we checked in wasn't long either."
4263,I've been vegetarian for 4 years now and this food allows me to eat everything I've ever missed. The burgers and chicken tenders are so delicious!
4264,"I spent $115 here yesterday on food to go and I ended up throwing it all out from how repulsive it all was. I've been coming here for 6 years and I know it's not the best or fresh but this time it was just absolutely inedible. Their milkshakes always have a taste that doesn't even seem like food, they taste of vomit. The chicken park sandwich was rock hard. The curry wings were terribly seasoned. The Mac and cheese is just gross. I wish I hadn't spent so much money I ended up spending another $100 on food somewhere else so my friends and I could eat"
4265,"Let me start off by saying the service was impeccable. Our server Fanny was fannytastic! She has wonderful recommendations and was very kind and delightful. The rest of the staff appeared to work as a good team and they delivered excellent service. I am in complete awe. My taste buds are still recovering from this delightful experience. I've lived here for a while and I can't believe this vegan gem has been hiding in my backyard all along. The popcorn shrimp was poppin! I couldn't believe how delicious and accurate they tasted. The vegan bbq Buffalo wings were phenomenal. I've missed wings for years since I went vegan. The taste and texture was just like real wings! You can enjoy chicken without harming or eating chickens, who knew!? The entrees were delicious too but the appetizers filled us up. Prices are reasonable for vegan so considering this was delicious New York vegan food, it was well worth the money (considering my boyfriend paid ). We will definitely be back!"
4266,"Always a favorite, and has been for years and years.Easily the best fake meat around, along with a huge menu of vegetable options. Highlights include the creole soul chicken, collard green rolls, philly cheese steak, chicken parm hero. Folks go nuts over the vegan desserts too.Plus, if you're lucky you'll be rubbing elbows with old heads from The Blue Note."
4267,"Boy, this place..... there are never enough words. The thing is: if you come at dinner or lunch, come here with time. I don't think they make reservations so you'll probably gonna enter, give your name to the host and they will call you when your table is ready. It does get busy on those times. But the restaurant is always open so if you got time in the middle of the afternoon you're gonna be seated when you enter.It's a pretty small restaurant, I went to their website once and found out it's open since 2002, and apparently never lost their taste.Since I've come to NYC I started looking for vegan restaurants; I'm not the type that digs or needs to eat healthy/raw vegan good, I'm the type who likes to eat very well seasoned and options that are creative. And asian vegan restaurants most of the time really fills that for me. So put this in your mind.Red Bamboo was the first I went to, and ever since when a friend wants to eat out I always recommend it. Most of the time I order- The Cajun Fried Shrimp: it's crispy and well seasoned. Didn't amaze me tho.Popcorn Shrimp: the texture reminds me of shrimp nd it's well-fried and crunchy. It's less crispy than the Fried shrimp. It's soft.Bamburger: it's simple and full of flavor. The texture is ""meaty"" and succulent and it's really filling.Barbecue Buffalo Wings: it's almost a sin to eat those wings and not remember them for the rest of your life.  The wings are probably what they're most famous for, and  you can see why the moment you take a bite. They are 5 mock chicken meat in a stick (probably made from soy and gluten), with a crunchy outside and VERY spiced buffalo sauce. The sauce is shiny and flavorful and the meat is not bland at all. It does remind a lil bit of a chicken taste but it's even better than meat. The outside is really tasty and the vegan sauce really cuts the spice. I recommend it so much. I also got one time the Sesame Beef, which is very filling, full of vegetables and comes with rice. But I do preffer to  eat starters or smaller dishes, that's just me..Well, It's not cheap at all. But it's a restaurant that you can taste the time and attention in the food. The service is good, staff is friendly. I recommend coming in the ""quiet hours"", the busy ones will be crowded and noisy, I don't mind it at all, but just to warn you. The variety in the menu makes you go there to try everything out!"
4268,It's not the first time I had vegan food so I knew what to expect. I came here with two other friends last Monday around 6:30. We were seated pretty quickly. It got pretty busy later in the evening.AmbianceCasualFoodI thought the food was decent. I wasn't wow-ed but it was well prepared.  The have a big menu so I'll be back to try some of their other options.ServiceThe waitresses were great and really attentive.I want to try the wings the next time I go back. Everyone raves about them.
4269,Good spot that is open late in GV. Wanted some late night takeout at the very start of the pandemic and these guys were one of the few that were open. It's vegetarian food only with imitation-style meat. Overall the food didn't have a ton of flavor but pretty good portion sizes for the price. The staff was pretty friendly and definitely appreciate the business during these tougher times.
4270,"The reviews hyped me up to come here. The BBQ wings... are bomb. I'd choose these over regular (chicken) wings. They're made out of soy and they even put a little stick inside the wings, which I think is cute. The BBQ sauce is flavorful and has a nice kick to it. It comes with a side of ranch but I like it without. I do think that this place can afford to add more than 4 skinny pieces of celery sticks as the side...I didn't get to try the other items on the menu but they have lots of options for a vegetarian spot, even dessert!"
4271,"Nice vegan place in the heart of the village and near NYU.  Fun eclectic menu (Italian, Chinese, Korean, etc.) with a lot of mock meat.  Great when I'm craving Chinese-AMerican classics such as sesame beef.  The desserts are amazing!  Huge slices of cake, without too much guilt (dairy free).  Wine list is interesting (never knew there is vegan wine!).Can get crowded at times, likely from NYU students.  I like to go for late lunch or dinner to avoid waiting.  Fun place to introduce non-vegans to plant-based foods."
4272,"Came here for dinner and was overwhelmed by the all the enticing menu offerings.It was a difficult decision but I ended up sharing the: Dragonfly Dumplings, Barbecue Buffalo Wings, Black Bean Ginger Stir Fry, and Sausage Sliders with Bacon and Guac.The Sausage Sliders were a ""miss"" for me. There was hardly any guac and the texture of the sausage wasn't super appealing.The Black Bean Stir Fry wasn't a unique vegan offering but I liked that they didn't skimp on vegetables.My two favorite dishes were the bbq buffalo wings and the dragonfly dumplings. The dumplings were fried and crispy on the outside and sooo plump. I loved the texture of the wings. It had a very similar texture to real duck meat.Overall, I had a satisfying meal and left super full. I didn't miss real meat at all. Service was also prompt but unobtrusive.I will definitely be back next time I'm in the area to order the bbq wings and dumplings!"
4273,"So extremely happy they reopened for business for take out and delivery! I was a frequent customer prior to COVID, so to say I was missing them is an understatement. Still the best vegan food in NYC!Always super tasty and plentiful portions. The mac and cheese is killer, and I cannot get enough of the Cajun shrimp. Thank you for offering unparalleled deliciousness!"
4274,"All I have to say is WOW. I have tried many vegan restaurants all over and this is one of the best ones. I came here with my non-vegan boyfriend and both of us were just blown away by the food. First of all, the menu is extensive, which is rare for many vegan restaurants. So many options to choose from it took me forever just to pick one thing- everything sounded amazing. The portion sizes are very generous and the prices are very reasonable. If you come here, you 10000% must try the buffalo BBQ wings. They are unlike anything you've ever had. I cannot tell you how pleasantly surprised we were when we took the first bite. Amazing. I'd say all their ""chicken"" dishes are superb because I also got the chicken cutlet sandwich and it was great. My boyfriend got the seitan sandwich, which he also enjoyed, but he agreed that the chicken sandwich was better. Everything was extremely filling too with all the protein from the mock meat. Overall, I am so happy I found this place because I will definitely be back. Definitely try the wings and any chicken dish!! I can not recommend this place enough, one of my new favorites. PS- if you are a vegan who does not enjoy eating mock meats, this place may not be for you. However, they do have a small section of their menu for vegetable dishes!"
4275,"Even in NYC which is vegan friendly, Red Bamboo is the only place where vegan food taste as good as it looks and sounds. Amazing menu selection that can be appreciated by all- when two of my friends visit it is both of their favorite restaurant and onlyOne is vegan! Love the Mac and cheese and the veggie burger, as well as the immense flavorful portions that don't cause you to dish out a fortune! Very affordable for the quality. The Brussels sprouts are great, but the fakin bacon is a must have (worth adding to the veggie burger). Appreciate this place for its affordable, delicious vegan food that has an extensive menu for all palettes. Makes eating vegan as a group not only doable, but fun!!"
4276,"I absolutely LOVE this place! A great friend introduced me to this delicious Vegan/Vegetarian gem last December. I was preparing for my big move to NYC in the Spring, so I was happy to try something different. Red Bamboo did not disappoint. The Chicken Satay, Dante's Cuisine, and Southern Fried Chicken are among my favorites, but there are so many other delicious dishes to try! They also make a very tasty Pineapple, Lemon, and Ginger drink, which I prefer hot. The Caramel Cake is good, but the gorgeous art canvas of the legendary Ms. Billie Holiday was the real treat! I liked it so much, I bought a similar piece for my new place. I finally moved to Brooklyn in March 2019, but work in the city. Not only is Red Bamboo within walking distance of my office, but also some of my other favorite places in the Village. I try to go in at least once or twice a month, although I'm not a vegan or vegetarian!"
4277,"Our son's gf is vegan so we ordered in, wow we're we happy with the choice, great variety and creative options! Drumsticks with wooden rod cracked us up, very handy."
4278,I came for the first time last weekend and had the buffalo wings. They were perfectly cooked in a very tasty sauce. I was impressed with the quality and look forward to trying other items on the menu.
4279,"Ordered for the first time for lunch today eager to try something new during COVID. I'm not even a fully devoted vegan but this is the BEST vegan food I've EVER had! I didn't think to take a picture before I devoured the yummies. The crab rangoon, Almond Coconut (soy) chicken, Roti with Curry sauce and steak and potatoes were DEVINE! Adding Red Bamboo to the lunch rotation."
4280,Perfection. Quality ingredients + friendly service = Molto bene!! Don't ever close. Please. Just trudged thru heavy snowstorm across FiDi just to get my Montesarchio. Would do it again in a heartbeat. Keep up the good work guys   - Roberto.
4281,"In the summer of 2015, I had an internship on Wall St. & Nassau.  Until that point, I had not spent much time in FiDi and believed it to be a food wasteland.  But my fellow intern-friend and I made a point to try as many new lunch places in the neighborhood as possible, and we quickly discovered that I had been misinformed about FiDi-- there are lots of delicious food options, especially for lunch.Of them all, Pisillo takes the cake, and to me there is no competition.  Time and time again, I go way out of my way to get a sandwich from Pisillo.  To be clear, I don't live in the same borough as Pisillo, and I haven't ever worked anywhere near Pisillo since the summer of 2015.  But I have nearly missed a transatlantic flight because I wanted a Pisillo sandwich for the plane ride.  And the sandwich was so large I was eating leftovers of it on Day 3 of my trip.Remarkably, even though I've been coming to Pisillo for the last seven years, I've only ever had the Cagliari-- sopressata, artichoke, provolone, and hot spread.  But for the one time they were out, I have only ever gotten it on semolina bread.  This is in my opinion the best sandwich in New York City, and frankly, possibly the best sandwich in the whole world.There are usually two factors that distinguish a food place from its peers-- (1) quality of ingredients; and (2) quality of service.  Pisillo delivers on both.I believe I've heard the shop owner tell me that all of the ingredients are shipped regularly from Italy.  Whatever the case is, the quality of ingredients is exceptional.  And not that bigger always means better, but these are huge sandwiches.  One Cagliari on semolina is longer than my laptop is wide, and my wife and I usually share one sandwich over the course of two meals.The service is also amazing.  Always extremely warm and welcoming.  There's nothing like amazing service to validate your decision to eat out.Because of all of the reasons mentioned above, I've never thought twice about whether the relatively high price tag is worth it.  Pisillo is a gem."
4282,"It's definitely a staple in fidi, sadly like many venues it's starting to go down. Here's to hoping it returns to its epic self. Because we used To grab a SandwichFromHere very often. It was always consistently balanced and the advise from the brother sister team was perfecto! Pisillo Panini is the usual order, we do miss bro and sister from the old team , miss chatting with them while waiting for the order. New staff isn't as kind or inviting, and forget about accommodating with the orders, which is understandable but it was nice toHave a friendly shop you trusted back a few years ago."
4283,Catanzaro sandwich was pretty spicyAuthentic Italian sandwich shop .It's cash only but they have an atm inside
4284,"Good sandwiches, they are so huge the two of us could easily share one. Worth a shot for lunch."
4285,"Small family owned shop, quality bread, excellent sandwiches. Highly recommend this place."
4286,"Another spot that was featured on the Best Thing I ever ate so decided to give them a try.  Somehow thought the restaurant would be bigger but a small spot with some high top tables and bar stools for seating.Cash only unless you order online. They do have an on-site ATM. The Sandwich selections were plenty (35) and overwhelming in a good way.   Also, bread is baked fresh daily & have a choice of seven types of bread for your sandwich.  The Sandwich is substantial and can easily be shared for at least two.Ordered the Pisillo(#26-featured on BTIEA) and Palermo (#8). The Pisillo-so much goodness going on here!  Salty Prosciutto, Porchetta and Bufala mozzarella which balances it out.  Arugula and Balsamic Vinegar take it over the top!  The Palermo-Soppressata with the Mozz is excellent!  Only thing is next time I would ask for light on the peppers or on the side as the portion was generous and these peppers lived up to the billing and were spicy.Looks like they have a second location on Chelsea but this one closes earlier.  Order was ready as promised and the gentleman that got our order was friendly.  Also liked that I got a ""How did we do?"" survey shortly after pick up.A BTIEA favorite that lives up to the hype!"
4287,"It's everything you want from a real NY hero. Fresh fresh Italian breads, sliced on the spot (no meat sweats) Italian meats, the exact amount of proper greens like arugula and the quintessential Italian roasted peppers. Huge portions taBoot yea and the owner is always in. You cant go wrong here. All around excellent!"
4288,"These sandwiches are gigantic. My go to sandwich is always the pisillo (highly recommend). Weighed it this time - the whole sandwich was 2.5 pounds!!! It is a good idea to share with another person if you want to finish the sandwich in one sitting. If not, then this sandwich could easily be two meals. Used to order these sandwiches all the time before the work from home life. So glad that this place is still open. Love ordering on ritual since it does take some time to make these huge sandwiches."
4289,"Although unassuming from the outside, this little sandwich shop on Nassau street serves some of the best authentic Italian sandwiches in NYC. They are not the 'paninis' you may think of that come pressed, but rather are  the true panini type sandwich with authentic Italian cold cuts that you cannot find at your typical deli. When ordering, you can't go wrong with the Pisillo, or any of the sandwiches with buffalo mozz. The sandwiches are gigantic and are enough for two meals and then some. The inside has a few tables, with additional seating next door. The owner, Carmello, is super friendly and awesome. Hands down my favorite lunch spot in Fidi."
4290,"Pisillo.. where do I begin? I started working in the area over seven years ago. The old-timers at my job would  Always talk about this sandwich spot... and from then until now pisillo has remained a staple in my work cheat meal rotation. Over the years, Some people I've worked with  preferred the overstuffed l unhinge you're jaws"" sandwiches from faiccos , but those of us who choose quality over quantity stay true to Pisillo. We always go back. I would rather have quality ingredients from Pisillo. And it's not like the sandwiches aren't filling... They are literally the length of my arm, but they aren't overstuffed, which I personally enjoy. you actually get to enjoy and savor each succulent ingredient. Sometimes the hardest part is finding someone to share a sandwich with. I think I've tried just about every bread option there is and the sfilatino and semolina are in classes of their own. Actually this entire place is a class of its own. You won't  to find anywhere better in New York City or anywhere more authentic. Cheers, Pisillo crew."
4291,"The greatest Italian sub in all of NYC! And even that is an understatement!Each sub on the Pisillo menu is named after a city in Italy. My favorite is #26 Pisillo, which is the perfect symphony of saltiness from prosciutto di parma and porchetta paired with the creaminess and freshness of bufala mozzarella along with the acidity and tanginess of roasted peppers and balsamic dressing and slight bitterness of arugula. For just $16, this sub is a good deal in NYC. The bread is delivered fresh daily from a local bakery, so it absolutely the best vessel for the greatest Italian sub. My favorite bread is Focaccio and if they run out, my second go-to is ciabatta. If you order at the store, it is CASH ONLY.  You could order on their website if you would like to pay by card and just pick up from the store. Do not miss out on the greatest sandwich/sub in NYC!"
4292,This place was pretty good. The sandwiches are huge. I came with my mother and we both got a sandwich. Should have just gotten one because they are so big. They are packed with flavor and the bread is so delicious. @raulvsfood on Instagram
4293,"Maybe this was what Bonnie Tyler was singing about when she sang that she was holding out for a hero.A slump buster. If you need something big, heavy, and delicious, this will do it for you. Everything about this hero is delicious. It has everything that you could possibly ask for in a hero. For $15 (cash only), you will find yourself in bliss; head over heels, falling in love with this hero, over and over again.Bread: Perfect, just perfect. Crunchy outside, chewy inside, that nice crumbly feel that will tell you that you should not eat this in a car. The semolina bread is their big ticket bread and should be the bread you get every time.Meat: I ordered the Pasillo, which contains both prosciutto and porchetta. The meat is so succulent and perfectly portioned that it alone would work well. It also helps that both meats are easy to digest, so you can continue eating both these meats without worrying about your stomach.Cheese: Do I really need to explain this one? Buffalo mozzarella is the king of all cheeses, and Pasillo respects this cheese. It holds the hero to a higher authority, and you taste it with every bite. Garnishing: If I were to take points off, it would be here. The peppers are a bit much, as is the balsamic dressing. They almost ruin the hero because there is too much of both here in the hero, resulting in a near soggy hero, and a bitter taste due to going overboard on the arugula. This is where you have to tell the staff to go light on this stuff, or you will pay later with an extended bathroom visit, or worse, an unpleasant meal. --I really loved everything about this hero, and this business. These men are true Italians, and they are proud of what they do and are confident you will get the best hero, every time. They got me pumped up to try one of their heroes thanks to their upbeat attitude, and an unwavering confidence. This is the real deal, and they know it."
4294,"This place is the number 1 best place to get a real Italian sandwich in the entire New York City. Amazing prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, and the perfect amount of balsamic vinegar, not too wet. Their Pisillo is to die for. Best deli in the whole city."
4295,"The heaviest sandwich I've ever held! My initial thoughts when ordering online was...$16 dollars for a sandwich is pricey! However, when I actually picked up the sandwich and walked out of the store, I realized how much bang for your buck it was. To top things off, it was actually tasted good and the ingredients fresh! It was enough to last me for 4 meals (probably two if your stomach capacity is greater than mine). The sandwich heats up nicely in the oven the next day, and surprisingly the bread doesn't get soggy at all. Beware that they are cash only, unless you order from an online platform."
4296,"OMG, this place rocks!We found this place from an EarthTrekers article on 5 days in NYC.They recommended Pisillo's and I am glad we took them up on it.  We ordered the highlighted sandwich #26 (Pisillo: Prosciutto Di Parma, Porchetta, Bufala Mozz, Roasted Peppers, Arugula and Balslamic Dressing) for $15.90. It sounds pricey but it is their most expensive sandwich on their menu and most popular for a reason, it's fabulous!There is more than enough sandwich here for 2 people. It was reminiscent of the ones I've had in Southern Italy years ago. Very full of flavor, hearty and filling. So good.Service was fast and great and friendly. The inside staff were efficient and looked authentically Italian. The busboy was from Palermo, Sicily and spoke Italian and was super cool. We ate outside in the covered area and it actually began to rain so the covered eating area was appreciated. Overall, this place is definitely worth a try for a wonderful sandwich. Definitely try it when in NYC. I'll be back one day for another one!"
4297,"Don't let the high prices fool you, you are getting what is essentially a sandwich and a half, these things are huge. Taste is great too. I've never been able to finish a full sandwich in one sitting so maybe plan for that.Only thing that's slightly annoying is it's still cash only while being in the financial district. I expect cash only in places like Chinatown but not here. Alternatively you can just use seamless and pick it up.All in all great place to go for sandwiches."
4298,"I think I misunderstood the type of sandwiches going on here by the American understanding of panini. Don't let that sway you though. This place is the real deal. I saw a review that the sandwiches were close to two pounds and thought they were joking...nope! I was going to a park the next day and came here the night before. I now NEED to try fresh because even then they were insanely good. The value is definitely there because the two of us are big eaters and could not finish two sandwiches. I will so be back for the amazing meat, cheese, and marinated veggies and really recommend you try it out as well. Yum!"
4299,"very friendly staff and probably the best authentic italian sandwiches in nyc, 100% recommend!!!"
4300,Don't go hear often but when I do go it never fails. I would say they have the best sandwiches in the downtown area and you def get your money's worth. The sandwiches are always packed with meat and cheese and they're the length of a football field. Ok maybe not that long but still pretty big sandwiches. I normally have half for lunch and then half for dinner. I normally go with the Number 26 Pisillo Panini on Semolino Bread
4301,"These paninis are no joke! I got #5 Parma Panini, and it was definitely too big for any normal human to consume in a single sitting. Maybe if you are a linebacker who just got off the field from a Patriots game could you conceive of consuming this entire behemoth in a single sitting. Unless you are really hungry or planning on eating this for dinner and lunch, I would suggest finding a friend, or 2, or really even 3 friends to share this beast with!The people behind the counter were very nice and authentic, Italian style.They don't accept credit card so if you only have card, will need to order online or through Ritual App."
4302,"A coworker recommended this place to me and I'm glad I took a walk to check it out! Ordered the Palermo on sfilatino bread: sopressata, fresh mozzarella, hot peppers, arugula & then tacked on a little truffle oil. $16+ for a sandwich but as the hundreds of other reviews state: It's HUGE! I wound up eating half and saving the rest (but to be real, I could probably eat another half of that half. Come on, where are the Italians?! We EAT!) Lots of flavor and the truffle aroma floated through the air when I unwrapped it. Fresh bitter arugala, spicy peppers and large peppercorns throughout the sopressata made for one flavorful sandwich. Solid spot for authentic Italian sandwiches."
4303,"Pisillo sandwiches blow me away every time. You're probably thinking - what's so special about these sandwiches? I honestly couldn't tell you. They just taste so damn good. The staff is always so warm and friendly, and they're always willing to make recommendations and talk you through your the different options. The meat slices are the perfect balance of salty and savory. I've even tried the tuna and vegetarian sandwiches. All of it has been amazing so far.The sandwiches are humongous, so you can spread it over a few meals or split with someone. Also, if you're a fan of spicy food, you can always request to add the hot pepper spread. Do you self a favor and order a sandwich! Also, don't forget to bring cash."
4304,"I decided to get Pisillo's for a picnic with friends downtown at Battery Park and, for the most part, I didn't regret my decision. The #26- Pisillo is as heavenly as it seems.  How can it not be- prosciutto, porchetta, roasted red peppers, buffalo mozzarella, arugula and balsamic vinegar- an amazing combination. I think it was $16 with tax which is very reasonably priced for the ginormous portion that they give you. So why did I knock off a star? Because the deli employee messed up my other order. In all fairness it is hard to hear with the masks and all but it was quite frustrating when I ordered the #24 (a vegan sandwich) and I get the #34 (a tuna sandwich) for a friend and my friend doesn't eat fish and I had to take it home (not that I regret that but you get my point, my friend was left sandwich-less). Needless to say, if I recommend one thing, it's to not only say the # but specify what's in it or double check before you pay. It's an honest mistake that can happen so there's no harm in making sure. That's pro tip #1. Pro tip #2 is you've got to get the semolina bread...absolutely delicious. All in all, this is an old school Italian deli that's worthy of it's hype."
4305,"I am not a sandwich kind of gal, never have been, I love my carbs but bread normally never does it for me....but this. place. is. AMAZING. I worked in FiDi before covid hit so it was a quick walk from the office, but now that I'm working from home all the way in Brooklyn - I find myself dreaming about the pisillo panini! So delish and one sandwich was enough for my boyfriend and I to share. I would even have leftovers! I would highly recommend."
4306,"We were in the area, hungry & hoping for that NY atmosphere with good food. Great sandwiches. Small deli with limited seating but it was mid afternoon and we were able to get a table easily. Friendly staff."
4307,"I was embarrassed walking down the street eating this. Not because it's not super delicious, because it is...but because it looked like I was eating a grown man's arm. This sandwich is massive. Come with hungry friends. P.S. I ate the entire arm myself. Not my proudest moment."
4308,OUTSTANDING  with  up my partner and I found this amazing Italian sandwich shop in downtown Manhattan if you are in the area trust me we I'll NEVER WILL BE SORRY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST SANDWICH EVER ( btw I order the Pisillo sandwich
4309,Heyyyyyyyy oh!This true Italiano panini joint located right by Fulton Street Station is a must and lives up to the hype.This spot is a Wall Street favorite and everyone who works in FiDi knows it's the best panini spot.This unassuming joint is not noticeable and you can walk by it a million times. It has only a few tables and a bunch of people speaking Italian behind the counter. I highly suggest getting their most well known panini the pissilo which is amazing and more delicious with every bite if you can finish it in one sitting everyone will be impressed as it is a true foot long or longer. It is a little pricey but it is more than enough for 2 people.In short:- Amazing Paninis - Enough for 2 people- Cash only- Small Shop
4310,"As a tofu lover, this place is amazing. Even if the rest of your group isn't into tofu, there's plenty of other Korean options that will satisfy them. Only thing is the entire group must be present to be seated."
4311,One of the best Korean BBQ spots in all of ktown. The fried fish side dish is always an added nice touch. Love the combo platters! DELICIOUSSS and great service! Love love love!
4312,Great spot for tofu soup! We ordered the oyster and seafood. They have combos available but only on weekdays
4313,"This place in ktown is SO spacious, as they have a huge first and second floor! Note, they do require a proof of vaccination if you do want to sit inside. The waitresses are all so attentive and really speedy. The food/drinks came out pretty fast. A variety of side dishes come out and and they were pretty decent. The soondubu is a bit sweet if you don't get it spicy. After about eating half of the bowl, it was hard to finish the broth without going back and forth with other side dishes."
4314,"COCKROACH on the food. I am writing this review, because I had an terrible experinced ever. Me and my friends went bcd today for late lunch. First, the server didn't give us a water untill we asked her and it came out when the food comes. Secondly, my order was a wrong order, so I told them and they didn't give me any apologize or an explanation about this. Fianlly, we found a COCKROACH. I was not able to finish my food and they didn't do anything about it. They just say sorry, but I think this is not a way to treat a customer. I am so dissapointed and I'm not gonna go here again."
4315,"The wait on a Monday night was about 30 minutes but once inside, it was worth waiting for.  I tried the medium spicy mandoo soondubu to mix it up and it was good although my favorite is still the mixed soondubu with seafood and beef.  The seafood pancake was also really good and the banchan which included the fried croaker was good."
4316,"3.5Very efficient service. Ordered the mushroom soondubu and was not impressed. Given BCD's reputation, willing to come back and try a different dish as my friend had the kimchi soondubu and loved it."
4317,"They really know what they are doing here! The Covid parklet is heated yet has open circulation as they keep the windows open. Service here is notably fast and attentive, even when they are busy. They refilled my side dishes without me even having to ask.Food wise, was delish! We ordered hot stone bibimbap with beef and pork tofu soup. FYI they take their spice levels serious here! I love spicy so I got my tofu soup extra spicy and almost died."
4318,"Got takeout from BCD Tofu House. The food was good as always - not too much of a difference compared to eating in the restaurant. I always get the soups whenever I come to BCD, but this time we got some other dishes instead to try. The bibimbap was great, and the bulgogi was super flavorful. The tteokboki was good but nothing special. Would recommend to come to grab a bite or get takeout from if you want something casual."
4319,"Been here numerous times before and it's one of my top go-to places for tofu soup in the NYC area. Prices are on the higher end for tofu soup, but they are consistently solid & delicious. However it isn't the *best* tofu soup I've had. Banchan is provided and the server kept refilling some of the ones that I really liked.Service: Pretty good, attentive servers...they are quick and direct. COVID: They don't take your temperature. Outdoor dining is available in an ""outdoor"" house with heat lamps and opened windows. They force you to keep the windows open for air ventilation which I really appreciate since some people wanted to close them b/c it was cold."
4320,"Did not come for food. Only came to dance at night. Fantastic selection of Latin music. I am not much of a great dancer but people will approach you to dance and will never make you feel self conscious. Bartenders were all very animated, respectful and fun! The bag check was organized and efficient. The only downsides - the line for the bathroom was very long and there was a $15 cover for girls and guys! But I could definitely see myself coming back for a good time!"
4321,"This is such a fun restaurant in EV. Depending on when you want to go there, you might need to be prepared to wait. I've dined here and drank here on multiple occasions. What i'd recommend is: - Guacamole, though the last time I ordered this I did feel like it was lacking salt. - Fish tacos- Arepitas cubanas with pulled pork( I want to try the arepa churrasqueso soon)- Pinchos de polloI haven't been able to come for brunch, but don't worry- it's on my list!They have a HH special and the margarita's are pretty good.The vibe is fun, it always seems like a decent crowd that turns out and I know this turns into a night party once the restaurant shuts down on the weekends. Should you check it out? Yes! Reliable, good food and decent drinks. I'll definitely update my review once I come back for Brunch. 4.5/5"
4322,"Great spot that wears many hats including good brunch restaurant, nice spot for happy hour and snacks, and an all out dance party spot late night. This particular visit was for brunch and the egg burrito certainly hit the spot. Could have used a bit more guac with it, but overall was very happy with my meal and of course the frozen marg to wash it down"
4323,"For being able to seat 7 people at a cramp bar, I have to give them props for making it work. I had a pretty fantastic time! Walk ins only. The vibes was popping on a weekend night, with loud music and parties from one end of the circle-like interior layout to the other. The workers were efficient and friendly in seating us despite how busy it was. The area they gave us was nicely private and enclosed. I ordered the Churrasco, Quesadilla de Churrasco, and a Frozen Mango Margarita. They have a happy hour special every day (including weekends!) from 12PM - 8PM.Original margaritas are $9 and flavors are an extra buck. The Frozen Mango Margarita ($10), although hard to drink at first given the fat icy chunks, was so so yummy and fruity. I always love when I can taste the mango flavor that is equally as strong as the alcohol. The Quesadilla de Churrasco, or Steak Quesadilla ($15), was disappointing to me. I don't recommend getting given the small portion and the lack of cheese. I'm glad I didn't waste a Lactaid pill on this! The Churrasco ($29), on the other hand, was AMAZING. I took one bite, and I fell in love. That grilled skirt steak was perfection, and they actually gave me a true medium rare! Easy to cut, easy to chew, and with the slight sourness of the chimichurri sauce? Perfection! Plus, those beautiful golden baked yuca fries offered an even heartier and sweet embellish to the classy meal. They also gave us a fat portion of Chips w/ Guac & Salsa on the house. Everyone else's food looked amazing and the staff was fast and wonderful. Totally come here for fun vibes and a comforting night (or brunch!) out."
4324,"The East Village is always happening and hopping. Speaking for myself, I don't know it inside out so when my friend suggested Yuca Bar for brunch, I was in!This space is a large one---sitting on the corner with adorable interior, but also with wrap around outdoor accommodations. This could be said for most spots in the EV as dining al fresco is common. They supposedly have HH going on daily but we stuck with coffee and tea.There was a pretty good selection of Mexican and traditional selections on the menu and I was immediately drawn to Guacamole Toast better known as Avocado Toast. My friend chose the Steak and Eggs.Service was really good and our meal arrived not long after placing the order. We were also informed as soon as we sat down that the dining limitation would be for 90 minutes. I can see why.When we left, the place was packed.My Avocado Toast was delicious. One big slice of sourdough bread layered with fresh/well made Avocado and finally topped with 2 poached eggs.A side salad accompanied the entree.My friend had no complaints with her selection and raved about the Chimichurri sauce that was served on the side.Overall, Yuca Bar is a fun and always festive restaurant to consider for brunch, apps, drinks or dinner.  It won my approval!"
4325,"Best place for happy hour deals and food! food is always filing and the guac is whipped and creamy, highly recommend always!!"
4326,"I went to yuca bar last night with a friend around 6:30 and got seated inside. They have happy hour every day until 8pm so we were able to get a few drinks at $9 for the deal. The passion fruit and mango margarita we're great! My friend got two mojitos and the addition of the sugar cane was a nice touch for garnish. To start off, we got an order of guac pico de gallo and chips and it didn't not disappoint. The portion size was generous and the Chip basket also included plantain chips. We decided to get a few different tapas to share and I'm glad we did because everything was delicious! The pulpo ala parrilla was so flavorful and was one of the favorites! The shrimp ceviche was also super fresh and the avocado chunks in it was a nice touch. We also ordered the Brazilian steak skewers with chimichurri rice and they were very juicy. Overall I would definitely come back."
4327,"This place really surprised me.  I'm not big on Pan-Latin American food nor tapas.Sitting down outdoors, I liked the setting but was really struggling with the menu because I was leaning toward the Arepa but I kept picturing an extremely dry mouth at a Pan-Latin restaurant.  Luckily this wasn't the case.  First, I was more than pleased that I was able to get a meat free option and most importantly it tasted so good.  One of the best Arepas I've had and I've had them in Bolivarian Republic of Gran-Colombia so I was beyond pleased.Service was top notch and I am glad that I did not let my judgement get the better of me and I experienced a new spot."
4328,"Pleasantly surprised. Walk by this place all the time, never gave it a second thought. We were looking for a place that had a late happy hour and after googling random places, we decided on this one. The margaritas are not great, had to send mine back, but the sangria was excellent. The food was delicious, never had a veggie burger from a Mexican restaurant before, but it was really good. This place is a nice stable restaurant in the Lower East Side. They are usually always busy. Around 9pm they shut down the restaurant, remove the tables, and it becomes a Latin discotheque. We stayed for a little while, then realize it wasn't really our science during the discotheque. Ive been craving their veggie burger since I left. Can't wait to eat there again."
4329,"I've been wanting to give this place a try & finally made my way here, we came in & were seated right away. Drinks to start had the Caprihana ah very harsh w the lemon taste not that great, we switched to the Red sangria much better. On the Tapas we tried the stuffed platano relleno, tostada & yuca fries.The Plátano relleno aka stuffed plantain was very good, the roasted pork meat was very tasty, The Tostada was great as well , decent size good tasting meat. The Yuca fries were the winner of the night they were delicious, nice taste fried but not greasy really good fries.Decent looking place , good music playing , service was good & prices are reasonable, we enjoyed our food & drinks."
4330,Came for brunch this past weekend and had a lovely time. Very nice service and great music. Had the steak and eggs with bottomless brunch and it was delicious!
4331,Happy Hour every day here basically ! ! !Octopus - itself it's quite tender but a bit lack of the sea flavor that an octopus should have. Avo hummus that came with it was really good.Pork Rib with Espresso BBQ sauce - so goood so tender the meat just fell of the bone and the sauce was delicious and rich but not too rich.Arepa (white corn cake) Jardinera - arepa was a bit dry to me. Not loving this as much as to the other two.Drinks are a bit too sweet for me here.
4332,Great vibes here!! Really generous happy hour (daily from 12-8). Mojito comes with a sugar cane garnish which is really fun & actually delicious & refreshing to chew on. Queso fundido was good too but wish it came with more tortillas (homemade though!) First time trying and now definitely one of my favorite happy hour spots!
4333,Yuca bar has always been my favorite spot! Food is tasty and drinks are amazing and strong. Staff is friendly.Tip: they have happy hour everyday until 8pm and half price tacos every Tuesday
4334,"The service snd cleanliness has gradually declined As a native LES-er, i Have been going here for years decided to stop by here earlier and was stuck on how dirty this place is Initially wanted to sit indoors but it was a fucking sauna in there. Flies everywhere and when bought to the server's attention, she simply replies ""yea there's always flies in this area"" while referencing my table. She then proceeded to try and take an order. Also noticed that my silverware was on the bare table without any napkins. Great. Didn't order anything. Just walked out. Never returning."
4335,"I came to this place twice so far and have had a great time both times. The food is bombbbbb - I have tried the yuca fries, the steak skewer things I think called churrasquinos, and empanadas. The drinks are great too and happy hour is til 8! Frozen/on the rock mojitos and margaritas. The best part is the music is always on point: I love a place with good music and good vibes. A fun time! Definitely worth going to."
4336,"I left Yuca Bar very happy, and its not just because the drinks were strong! The overall experience was amazing. They offer a great happy hour with many full sizes drinks under $15. I had a mojito to drink and we ordered the empanadas as our starters. For our entrees we had the churrasquinhos and the pinchos de pollo. Everything was amazing. The drinks were big, sweet, and featured a generous serving of etoh. The the empanadas were packed with flavor and the meat skewers were tender and well seasoned. The staff was also really nice and very attentive. Overall it was a great experience. Cant wait to go back!"
4337,"Came here for brunch on a weekday and they have indoor and outdoor dining. It was pretty busy but we were greeted by multiple waitstaff asking if we were waiting to be seated. It took about 10 minutes for us to get seated, which wasn't bad. And if it took longer,just get a drink to start. For covid, staff are wearing masks except for the one guy. The tables are also separated by a panel for distancing.Only speaking for brunch. I love egg benedict so of course I ordered the arepas benedictos : with ham and home fries, there is the option for salmon and rice and beans as well, and my friend had the guacamole toast with eggs. It was quite interesting with the arepas,but overall enjoyable. My friend had also enjoyed the guacamole toast as well. Although I don't remember the taste too much now, but no complaints there. We also had the 1 hour bottomless mimosas, in which our waitress was on top of whenever we were empty. Overall a great experience. Will give dinner service a try next time."
4338,"Love this place. Food is fresh and very well cooked with great season. My favorite was the yuca fried and the bread pudding . Decor is cute and the customer service was very friendly , fast and accomodating. I def recommend ."
4339,"Came here on a Saturday with a party of seven for brunch. There was no wait and we were seated right away. The happy hour and bottomless deals were great for drinks. I ordered the steak burrito with a side of yuca fries and enjoyed my meal. Others in my party weren't as impressed with their food, but overall we did not have any major complaints. Definitely a good option for drink deals if you're looking for that."
4340,"I just don't know about Yuca. My friends loved this spot and were excited to bring me here for the first time. We were able to get a large group seated without a reservation, and ordered drinks and snacks. I absolutely loved my Mojito (it comes with sugar cane in the drink) and my yuca fries were great too. Everyone else seemed happy with their drinks and food! However, the negative experience came from the staff. Cash was discreetly removed from my friend's wallet, and then ""given back"" to her once she noticed. The staff member claimed she had left her wallet in the bathroom, but it had never left the area of our table. We quickly left after this incident.Overall, food and drinks are fantastic, but stay alert at Yuca."
4341,"OMG. Go here for drinks and happy hour. I swear it's worth it. Also, the food is incredible, but wow the drinks! Great atmosphere. P.s. Try the yuca fries."
4342,After work happy hour spot! Great music! The bartender Pablo makes amazing drinks and entertaining. The guacamole was delicious!
4343,"Let me start off by saying that Yuca bar has been one of my favorites for a while. Ive been here for brunch, lunch and dinner on multiple occasions without ever being disappointed. I recently came twice before COVID hit - once for dinner and once for brunch, both of which where great. For brunch you get a prefix option ($21) that comes with either a mimosa, bloody mary, sangria or yuca sunrise. You can upgrade to $12 per person for 2 hours of unlimited mimosas or sangria which is 100% worth it in my opinion. The prefix also includes coffee or tea. I decided on the guacamole toast with eggs because how can you ever go wrong with avo toast (duh). It was really filling and came with a side salad to make me feel healthier, love it. Bae got the breakfast burrito. We both really enjoyed our meals and left as happy campers, literally after 2 hours of bottomless mimosas. Dinner here is always a good idea if you're in the area because theres really good music and a great vibe. I'm a big fan of coming during happy hour ($9 drinks) and getting assorted tapas. Pretty much everything I have tried has never disappointed. During COVID I actually came on the first day that NYC initiated phase 3 of outdoor dining. I was surprised at how smooth it was other than the fact that I could tell the staff was flustered. We had to send 2 of our sangria pitchers back because 1. had a plastic piece of something in it and 2. there was fly. I understand how difficult things are right now so we just asked the waitress to replace it and she was very apologetic and friendly about it. I didn't take stats off for it because I've never had this experience here and i'm sure that it's gotten better since. I can't wait to return soon and support one of my favorite restaurants in NYC!"
4344,"Come to Yuca Bar if you desire to people watch drunken college students stumbling down 7th St as you consume painfully average chips and guac over an overpriced mojito. My first mistake here was missing happy hour - had my drink been less expensive and had I been significantly more drunk, I likely would not have minded the food here.To start, the chips and guac were nothing more than mediocre. I must say, I appreciate the lack of superfluous oil on these chips. They tasted quite fresh, but the downfall of these tri-colored tortillas lay in the lack of flavor. The guac could have used a bit more heat and citrus, but guac is guac and tends to please the masses regardless of its recipe. I ordered the Spanish salad with added chicken for my main. It pains me to write about the chicken paired with this dish. The protein was as dry as Aoulef, Algeria (a small town with an average rainfall of 0.48 inches per year) and tasted of burnt firewood. The rest of the salad was, once more, painfully average. As for my unsweetened mojito: a job well done.My overall thoughts: come here with friends for a casual meal when you fail to get your act together and make a group reservation for a Wednesday night. Do not expect to consume food that will please the palate, though. My recommendation: get drunk and order some tacos. Hopefully the inebriation will mask the mediocrity of this food."
4345,"super amazing tapas place. The plantain with roast pork was amazing and the tacos were superb. Order the mushroom arape if you go here. That is Very very important! I could eat a mushroom arape everyday for lunch. The four stars is because we couldn't mix and match tacos - we assumed we would've been able to get multiple types especially as they are all the same price! Also, there weren't very many vegetarian options."
4346,"Excellent happy hour margaritas! The food was authentic (as far as I know) and delicious! Cute cozy place, good energy."
4347,"This place has amazing food, drinks were good, and the vibes were on point. I wish the menu was bigger and had more options because the things I tried were so delicious. And omg the bread pudding was to die for, so good!!"
4348,"Let me just start by saying I've been coming to this place for years and the food and service has gotten horrible. Not only that but the last time I went I left my cell phone in the bathroom and when I went right back to get it, it was gone! my boyfriend was calling it and my Apple Watch was ringing meaning it was nearby, my boyfriend looks inside the toilet cover Holder that is on the wall and finds my cell phone hiding in there and the waitress tells me, ""that was definitely a worker here hiding it until you left so they can snatch it at the end of their shift"". Definitely was a worker, if it was a customer they would've just took my phone and turned it off. Don't come to this place!!"
4349,"Since this is a small place they put screens between tables to allow for more seating. They still do not have their full menu which was disappointing because I was looking forward to getting the parrillada, but they were not serving that. The yucca fries which used to be my favorite at this place was also a bit disappointing when I went post Covid because they didn't taste how I remembered, nicely breaded and crunchy. Hopefully they will get their menu back soon."
4350,OMGOSH THE FOOD & Drinks!!! So good. Everything is delicious esp. the Paella and Arepas with steak. You gotta try the grilled octopus and desserts as well. Definitely recommend
4351,"Yuca Bar is a great spot for brunch! Especially now during covid, because they offer plenty of outdoor seating. The servers were all very friendly and all had masks covering their faces. They have a limited brunch menu, which is much more scaled back compared to their pre-Covid menu. However, they still have happy hour! I ordered the passion fruit frozen margarita, which was perfect on a 90 degree NYC weekend! I highly recommend the shrimp tacos! I almost wish I got 2 orders - that's how good they were! I also ordered the rancheros, which was just okay. My friend ordered the arepas benidictos, which was visually appealing, but lacked salt and flavor."
4352,"This place is run by crooks. I went here for brunch (food was meh, drinks were garbage), but before I sat down for brunch, I bought two drinks for my friend and me at the bar. I paid for these drinks at the bar and had an $18 charge. This charge is present on my credit card statement. Fast forward a couple days later and I had an additional charge for $48 on my credit card. I've called the restaurant five times now over the course of the week and they refuse to refund this erroneous charge claiming that I ""must have forgot about signing this bill"" or that maybe ""I was distracted"" and bought something without remembering. They refuse to face the obvious reality that they charged someone else's food to my credit card!And, before you ask, yes I also have a third (correct) charge on my credit card for the brunch I ate here. But the second (obviously incorrect) charge for $48 is the one in question. They refuse to refund me. They are crooks. This place is run by terrible human beings. If you care about fairness and doing what's right, avoid this place at all costs. Bad people run it."
4353,"YUMM! Came here with a group of friends for brunch. We were expecting to order the bottomless mimosas / sangria / margaritas that were on their online menu but they informed us that their bottomless option changed since Covid hit.  I forgot the price but you could only do mimosas and drink for 1 hour. Besides that slight disappointment, which is totally understandable, everything was fantastic! Great service and amazing food!! The atmosphere is very pleasant, especially when it's warm enough for them to open the windows up. I definitely recommend everyone try here."
4354,"We got the fish, steak, and octopus tacos and they were all amazing!! The outdoor area is beautiful and warm, we will definitely be coming back. Great service too."
4355,"been meaning to try this place for awhile. it always seemed really popular every time I walked by. we got the churasco, the quesadilla, calamari and the guac with chips.the churasco was delicious and it came with yuca fries ! definitely fell in love with it. we also really liked the guac with chips as well. the calamari and quesadilla was okay but the vibes of this place was definitely amazing. nice place to catch up with friends and chat over a mealhope to try their happy hour the next time we go! it's from 12-8pm. will definitely be back"
4356,"Now that NYC is in phase 2 city wide, I decided to get some food with friends as a pre bday celebration for one of them. We all agreed on yuca bar.Upon arrival you can see the various signs of precaution. You must wear a mask and only outdoor seating for parties of 4 max and all tables 6feet apart. Our party was 5 but we were accommodated and sat in the far back outside. I would be lying if I said I wasn't scared before going because I was, but seeing the waiters with mask and gloves kept me relieved- as well as seeing how hard the staff was on seating arrangements.Luckily we arrived at the start of happy hour so our drinks ranged from $8-$9. I ordered the passion fruit mojito since it seemed fitting for the hot summer day with yuca fries and fish tacos(2 in a order). The wait was super short and all our orders were properly served to us."
4357,"I love solid Latino-infused food and Yuca Bar nailed it. I went with a couple of friends and I got the pulled pork burger and yuca fries, my friends got the yuca burger and the Cuban sandwich. The pulled pork burger was magnificent - amazing flavors and the added avocado added a nice balance to the jalapeños. My friends loves their food as well. I also got a pisco sour. I loved having those in Chile and was super excited to see pisco on the menu. My drink was perfection and very reminiscent of that trip. The service was okay. It was extremely busy (which I loved - I miss the bustling New York night life). Our host was fantastic and very attentive. And our waitress was lovely, but we were definitely forgotten about a couple times and we ordered chips and guacamole that never came, which ended up being fine. For COVID: they had excellent outdoor seating - still had some personality and heating. Indoor seating is also an option and the inside is SO cool. They don't take reservations - we went around 8pm on a weekday and waited around 20 minutes. I definitely recommend it if you're in the east village!"
4358,This place has one bathroom and will let you pee yourself before allowing you to go to the bathroom.
4359,"Came here for a first date, it was good! Nothing super exceptional. I ordered a margarita/sangria cocktail and a quesadilla. I was surprised at how good the food was. Super crowded on a Saturday night, though. So we waited a while in line to be seated. Overall I would come here again but only if someone else invited me/was paying. The drinks are good and the food was good, but ~just good, if you know what I mean."
4360,"Came here for a late afternoon snack and drink. They have good ample outdoor seating space and dividers. The setup also very cute with the plants around the seating area. Ordered the fish tacos and a sangria. I really enjoyed the fish tacos - the fried fish fillet was juicy and flavorful with chipotle aioli sauce and a thin slice of avocado to top it off. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. I recommend this place if you're looking for happy hour, brunch and or tapas in the east village."
4361,Went on a Monday around noon and I had a great experience! Got the $17 bottomless brunch with a friend and had mimosas which were tasty (I personally preferred that over the sangria and I tried both)! The service was quick and pleasant. My entree was a good sized portion and tasted yummy! Would definitely return!
4362,"Yucas is a decent quick stop if you are looking for an average time. The drinks are the only thing worth mentioning in terms of a positive. My wonderful girlfriend is in a quest to find the best Mojito in the city, and Yucas ranks on the better half of those being ranked. However, the rest of the offerings is what lands Yuca the two stars. We all want good food in a good portion. If you give me one of the two, I'll be happy. However, Yuca Bar has the audacity to supply neither of the two. The portions were small and the food was not worth finishing. The real travesty in this place is the bathroom. Once you make your way through a fun and lively environment that is thriving in the restaurant, you enter a different atmosphere in the bathroom. I felt like I needed a knife to protect myself in there. Dimly lit, flickering life, disgusting floors, wonky mirror, traumatized toilet, and a putrid smell to top it off. There's many bars within an arms reach. I would suggest you try somewhere else."
4363,Ok... this is my numero 1 when I'm in my old 'hood. On avenue A.. near park. They have both indoor and outdoor seating.   It's always packed but for some reason the powers that be made it possible lol. My friend and I met there around 5:00 p.m. for a quick bite and a drink. He arrived before me and was lucky to grab a table.   They are following covid protocol so you feel Comfortable. It is a mixed crowd of locals and out of towners because it is a favourite in the area.  I ordered the coconut Margarita and he had sangria..then thevstuffed sweet plantain and empanadas. Delicious beyond words. And I cannot say enough about the manager who meets people at the front door and makes you feel like your walking into your friend's place. I truly love this spot and I hope that they continue to do well despite COVID and anything else that comes our way. LOVE the Lower East Side
4364,"So yum. The atmosphere is really fun and lively with good drinks. The tacos come in 3 and my friend and I got steak, Chicken, and shrimp to split. They were all so good, especially the steak. Would be a good place for a small bday dinner or fun dinner before going out."
4365,Wow soooooo I really didn't expect the food to be yummy! It was great ! The steak was cooked to perfection ! The service was great ! And so were the drinks ! They put actual sugar cane in the Mojito which was impressive.  The beef empanadas I definitely  recommend !! They taste way better than the chicken. The place was very cute and the vibe was nice and chill great music!
4366,WowWow! Amazing customer service! Great atmosphere and  staff. The food was so good i got the steak and eggs w/rice and beans *drool* it was made just the way i ordered. We got the bottomless mimosas . My friends and i had such a great time we will definitely be back later in the spring!
4367,"I've been going here for years. Can't believe I've never left a review, but their churrasco never fails! Coming from someone who needs to try the  steak everywhere!"
4368,I LOVED THIS RESTAURANT! Drinks were nice and strong and the food had so much flavor to it! The food came out within 10 min of order which is great! I had to rush my dinner but will def be coming bak for more!!  They even had a band playing when I went in for Cinco De Mayo! I was so happy I went there it was worth the hour ride! YOU WONT REGRET IT!
4369,Good food. The chimichurri sauce on Yuca fries was great! I liked the garlicky flavoring. I'd recommend.
4370,Want to have fun Latin style? This is your place. I think this is the closest you'll get to feeling like you're clubbing in Miami. The servers are amicable and the crowd is pleasant.
4371,"Came on a Sunday for an impromptu brunch around 1pm. Seating was readily available for a group of 5. Vegetarian friendly? Eh there are some options but the breakfast options could be better. I ended up ordering a non-veg option (arepas benedictos) and asking them to take out the ham. I also think the arepas benedictions could have more flavor in the cilantro infused hollandaise sauce. The beans that accompanied the dish were very flavorful though, I could've eaten a whole bowl! For this being called a yuca bar, I didn't see much yuca inspired or infused dishes. Would've definitely liked to see that come out more in the breakfast / brunch menus. The bottomless experience includes mimosa or Bellini for 1 hour, and the drinks are decently strong so I think it's worth it.Aesthetics of this place are on point!! Cute Mexican inspired tiling and tables! Would I come back again? I wouldn't mind an affordable brunch with cute aesthetics so yes !"
4372,Review is just for the Bar and Happy Hour*Our bartender was super nice and made our drinks pretty strong. You can't really go wrong with 8 dollar happy hour drinks. My Moijio was delicious and it reminded me of the ones I had in Miami. I highly recommend their yuca fries. It came with chimichurri sauce and they weren't dry (like most yuca fries I've had from other places). Freaking delicious.
4373,"This had been one of my go to spots in my neighborhood but the service and food now stink. Went here with a group of friends three nights ago and the server didn't speak English. Last time I checked this is America where we speak English. Food was overpriced, overcooked and restaurant was overcrowded. Go check it out if you want Covid. NO MASKS ANYWHERE!"
4374,"It was a very busy place. Though, our server was quick and attentive. The food was yummy. Drink was good. It's a nice place to hang with friends"
4375,"I can here last night for dinner with a few coworkers. We ordered guacamole and chips for the table and various drinks. The drinks and guacamole were all delicious. I got the yuca burger for dinner and then also tried my friend's churrasquinhos. Both were incredibly dry. This was especially frustrating on the burger because I had ordered it cooked to medium and it was cooked to well done. Lastly, one person's meal took an extra 15-20 mins to come out so the rest of us were practically done eating by the time she was able to start."
4376,"Really delicious food and great service! The waiter was very personable and engaging, he's from Spain and was excited to talk with us about it!What we ordered: -Pulpo ala Plancha: this octopus dish was delicious! I definitely recommending ordering this when you come. The sauce was so delicious and very citrusy. I enjoyed dipping everything in the sauce-Pico de Gallo and Guacamole: the chips were tri-colored and also came with plantain chips. The gauc and pico were also very good. -Pechuga de Pollo: this chicken dish was delicious and came with mashed potatoes. I really enjoyed it! The food here is authentic and delicious. This is a great place in the village."
4377,I love visiting this restaurant over and over they're very friendly the food is delicious the sangria is out of this world we also ate Yuca fries and paella and some barbecue ribs it's so yummy
4378,"This place has made me fall in love with Peruvian food! I came here for brunch without reservations on a Sunday at 3:00 pm and wasn't disappointed. I had the arepas Eggs Benedict with salmon and a white sangria. The sangria was perfect and not overpowering. Now back to the food, it was beyond delicious and filling. It was a great plus that it came with some good ole rice and beans. I would definitely come back and recommend to someone looking for some bomb Latin cuisine! Completely worth the visit!"
4379,"I use to really love this place until they served me old meat. This is a review before Convid-19 impacted the world. I ordered calamari and it was good, order steak quesadilla and that was a huge mistake! It looked beautiful on the outside until I bit into it! It was disgusting!!! I called the waiter over and told him the meat tasted old and he took it back. After a few minutes, he came back and informed me he tasted it as well and it is not good. I did not receive any apologies and have not been back since! There is no excuse for ever giving a customer....OLD MEAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4380,"It's good, expensive. Steamed sea bass = looks and tastes good. Vegetables were undercooked. Fish itself is a little overcooked near the edges. Mushroom ravioli = was tasty. Mashed potatoes = inedible. Really sour. Don't order that. The fish was good but wished it wasn't slightly overcooked."
4381,"My friend described this as a slightly nicer version of the Smith, and while I've never been to the Smith, I unfortunately no longer think that was a compliment. My husband and I split the beyond burger and the smoked salmon Benedict. Our friends got a burger and an omelette. The eggs on the Benedict were nowhere near poached--completely solid when you cut into them, and nothing else about the dish was especially redeeming. We were going to split but after eating about a third of my portion, I passed it onto my husband. The burger was pretty dry but ultimately fine, and they served it (as with all French places) with an inordinate amount of fries. I wasn't 'wowed' by this place, but honestly if someone suggested this place for brunch I'd probably be okay coming back. Are other places even better?! Idk. Hopefully next time they'll take the egg out before it calcifies, but even if they don't, I suppose an egg is an egg."
4382,"food was amazing, cute vibe, server was very attentive, overall great experience. Alexandro was server for our table and he was so nice and the service was great."
4383,"Before Covid, Boucherie had consistently good food and decent service (with the requisite bit of ""attitude"" from the hostesses). After Covid, much of the wait staff left, elevating the busboys to waiter status. Due to their lack of food knowledge, some language barriers and limited training, the service has been noticeably subpar. When recently dining at Boucherie, I had to remind the waiter multiple times to bring the correct dishes out (as he kept misunderstanding the order). The wrong glass of wine was brought out. My plate was whisked away before I had finished my meal (about 3/4 finished).  I will not return until the newly appointed wait staff is trained and the service dramatically improves."
4384,"I had the beef bourguignon and it may have been the best beef bourguignon I've ever had (but I'm not sure it's still on the menu).  I'll be concise:  the food is good.  It's a beautiful restaurant.  It's expensive.  And it's very loud.  I would eat her again, especially if someone else was paying(!)."
4385,"Came here for restaurant week... Cute french restaurant that I had bookmarked because of Tik Tok hah. Decided to come in for lunch. Our waiter was really nice the food took a bit to come out (my friend and I were chatting so much that we didn't notice), but he made sure to check in with us. Drinks: La Mascaret - champ cocktail perfect for a hot day. Appetizer: Chilled tomato and watermelon soup - I was surprised by this. It was hot that day so I went for the chilled soup despite not being a fan of watermelon. But I really enjoyed it especially on a hot day. Beet and goat cheese terrine - Glad didn't get this. I'm not a fan of goat cheese, but my friend really enjoyed it. Entree: Petite Steak Frites - Classic steak. I felt it may have been a bit dry. My friend noted that it wasn't that hot and it probably rested for too long. Gnocchi la parisienne - Same with the gnocchi a bit dry as well. I feel people come here more for the ambiance and pics. We saw a few photoshoots happening. Service was great despite the wait for the food. Probably would come back for just drinks."
4386,Great place for an afternoon brunch. Very nice atmosphere and plenty of selection. Definitely recommend it.
4387,"Everything was so good. Service was very good as well. We started with the steak tartare and the Caesar salad. Honestly both were so good. We don't get either of these items often where we live at in Louisiana but both very fresh and light. For entrees, we did the mushroom ravioli and the duck confit leg. There is no way you can do duck confit leg wrong and it was so good. The mushroom ravioli was so good. It was stuffed with mushrooms and wild mushrooms on the outside with a black truffle beurre fondue. Drinks were phenomenal as well. Providence martini was very good and I don't drink martinis often. La vie en rose was also very good. Everything is just good here. Period."
4388,"classic, easy and lovely. perfect spot for steak frites and a great bottle of red any time of the day."
4389,Amazing service!! Thank you so much. I loved the bread and champagne and everything it was so incredible. This is beautiful.
4390,"Best burrito I've ever had, and it's vegan! (I'm not vegan, but my friend is vegetarian, and I'm always open to embracing vegetarian/vegan experiences). We came here during brunch, and ordered quite a few things. My friend had the gyro and breakfast omelet with Texas toast (both pretty good!). Her dish(es) tasted like a genuine gyro and the omelette tastes like real eggs. She enjoyed her meal. I had a breakfast burrito, that tasted like a curry goat roti. This have such nostalgia! And the portions were generous, thankfully! Also, service was AMAZING!I was surprised that our meals were full vegan, as it tasted like they had meat (don't worry, they did not). I would definitely recommend! My friend and I plan on returning."
4391,"Ok so I'm a fairly new full vegan. I have been slowly easing into being a vegan for about 6 months and have tried plenty of vegan restaurants. With that being said I can compare this to other vegan restaurants I have tried. I ordered the chicken and waffles, Mac and cheese, and the burger w/ fries for my boyfriend. The food overall was mediocre at best. Gave 3 stars for the mac and cheese and waffle  which were the best tasting things. The chicken had a very weird aftertaste to the breading and the burger was terrible. Maybe we tried the wrong things I don't know. We ordered takeout so I can't comment on service. Not sure if I would return."
4392,"Champs is a vegan favorite in Brooklyn. Serving veganized diner fare, I definitely understand why it might be so popular. Maybe I bought the wrong things? I made it over to Champs during the week in the middle of the day so there wasn't a wait. After perusing their menu I was turned off by their prices-- their price tags are heftier than your average diner, that's for sure. But of course, I have come to expect this of vegan fare especially in BK. I ordered their greek salad and mozzarella sticks. The greek salad wasn't all that great and IMO wasn't worth the price tag. Maybe next time I'll order their pancakes (which seem to be much more popular?) Their mozzarella sticks were def delish. Gooey and satisfying- what you come to expect from mozzarella sticks. Overall I would give Champs another try if I'm around the neighborhood and in the mood to try out their very popular pancakes. I'll stay away from the salads."
4393,"I'm a carnivore...I snuck into this place to see how the other half lives. And wouldn't you know it, places of delicious food and great service. I will go again for the peach cobbler! I don't know how they made the shrimps so real or the bacon but they are insanely good."
4394,"Overall I had a great experience at Champs! Service was great, decor was super retro and fun, and food was yummy. The favorites from my group were the Philly cheesesteak (I mean they use the very best- blackbird seitan!) with a side of tots and the poutine. The chicken vodka sub was pretty good too, it was more of a red sauce than a vodka and I think it would be better if the sauce was dispersed more evenly rather than just on top. My friend got the steak and eggs which he said was just okay. I wanted to try the milkshakes but I was too stuffed from those subs- they're huge!"
4395,Oh god. Vegan heaven is found! Everything was so delish and nary a thought about the did-you-realize-this-is-vegan ? Burgers are large and plentiful with the solid knife stabbed in the middle as if to make known - we mean meat (wink wink).  HIGHLY RECOMMEND if you are in the area. Just don't attempt to order when you have the munchies because you'd want everythig on the menu.
4396,"I LOVE vegan diner food, thank you champs !! Everything i tried was delicious, especially the pancakes"
4397,"One of my top 2 favorite Vegan restaurants I've been to in the city. Whenever I come I usually share 4-5 different items with my friends. This time we got the poutine fries (gravy was great), vodka chicken parm sandwich (texture and breading reminded me of actualu chicken), and then the two highlights of the night the buffalo cauliflower wings with ranch, and cinnamon swirl pancakes. The buffalo breading on the wings were delicious, and the pancakes were gooey and warm. We also tried 3 shakes: the girl scout, nut cruncher, and banana cream pie. We all agreed the girl scout was the best (this is coming from someone who doesn't even love mint choco chip ice cream). Delish meal! Make sure you make a reservation!"
4398,"Coming from an extremely picky eater, this is THE BEST vegan breakfast!! I come in quite frequently just for the breakfast slam where i customize it to just egg instead of tofu scramble, extra seitan bacon instead of sausage, and my choice of the amaZing banana pancakes come with it ofc (they do have other pancake flavors on the menu.) I've been coming here for about almost 4 months and their customer service overall is pretty dope, welcoming, and professional, i've never had a problem.DINING IN: I love how the waitresses pretty much read my vibe and are not one of those ""continuously coming back to see if you found everything ok every 5 minutes"" while im shoving my face and enjoying the comfortable atmosphere that im in while being there type of waitresses. Im extremely standoffish and value my time alone so i appreciate that they match my energy. :))"
4399,My go to comfort vegan food spot. Best diner in the city for sure! Highly recommend the breakfast burrito and the Mac n cheese. Also all the shakes are delicious!
4400,"Very cute find in West Village - saw it had a good reputation on Yelp and I would recommend!Went around noon without a reservation and was fortunately seated outside on a beautiful spring-like winter day in NYC. The outdoor seating is a little packed in, but after seeing the inside of the restaurant, I'm glad that we were seated outside. We tried sitting on the sidewalk, but apparently it is only for reservations since it is more spaced out. There are heaters in the outdoor dining.Overall, a good experience here. We started with the beignets and coffee and it was really delicious! For my dish, I got the grilled chicken sandwich with fries and it was really good. My boyfriend got the chilaquiles and really enjoyed it.Service was good, hostess was friendly. I would return!"
4401,"Food and service were both okay. Overall giving it a 3.5/5 stars. I had high expectations before coming and while I wasn't disappointed, I was also not impressed. I did however like the restaurant's decor and overall vibe. Would recommend the squash dish from the vegetable section and the meatball sliders! The French toast was also pretty good, but the beignet was okay."
4402,"I get the appeal of the Little Owl. A cute neighborhood restaurant by Joey Campanaro right below the Friends apartment. Cute, intimate, cozy. Gorgeous outdoor dining setup. It just doesn't make up for the food.The ambience is super and cozy, and the perfect setting for a small birthday dinner, a meal with your parents, or a good girl's catch-up over dinner or brunch.The food however is pretty lackluster in my opinion. The portions are small, pricy for what they are, and feels like something I could pretty easily whisk together at home. Most of the menu is fine, but $14 for two pieces of simple French toast and $15 for a poorly executed chilaquiles feels like high way robbery, even in West Village. As a native Texan, don't even get me started on the $23 surf and turf tacos.The joke amongst my friends is that I don't love the Little Owl but somehow end up coming here over and over again for some reason or another. I like the Little Owl, but don't get the 4 star review and hype around. Having said that, I'll probably be back for breakfast, dinner, and drinks lol."
4403,"After a friend recommended this spot to us (and visiting the Friends apartment many times without going there), we finally tried it on our latest NYC trip. They have a really nice outdoor seating area with heaters so we were plenty warm in the winter. We had a busy day full of eating planned, so we got a light brunch here and tried:- Poached Eggs- Gravy Meatball SlidersI really enjoyed both dishes. The biscuit with the poached eggs was delicious as was the sauce on the sliders. They also gave us complementary prosecco for our anniversary which was really nice. I would definitely recommend this spot!"
4404,"Food was quite dense and salty. Beignets weren't fluffy- they were a bit like the munchkins from Dunkin Donuts but a bit drier/breadier. One of the employees (seemed like one of the main hostesses) was quite rude to me and my partner, but seemed friendly to others. Could have been circumstantial (they were busy), but could be received as a bit target as the only non-caucasian people. Unfortunate because they have a prime location (right under the Friends apartment), and a cute/homey vibe that I'm a big fan of."
4405,"My wife and I celebrated our 5 year anniversary with brunch. We knew should only order 2 items from the menu as we were going to about 5 other restaurants the same day. We narrowed down our choices to four: Gravy Meatball Sliders, Chilaquiles, Pork Enchiladas, and the Poached Eggs. Thankfully our server was kind enough to gently nudge us in the right direction. We ordered the Gravy Meatball Sliders, and the Poached Eggs.Before our food came out, our server surprised us with prosecco. It was perfect. Likewise, I thought the sliders and the poached eggs were executed very well. I liked them both but if I had to pick my favorite I'd give it to the sliders."
4406,5 star brunch spot. I had the Chilaqueles and my girlfriend got the chicken sandwich. We also got the beignets which were great. Food was 6 out of 5 stars and reasonably priced. Service was good and good vibes. Indoor seating is limited so probably try to go when the whether is good. Thanks!!
4407,"Having come by this area many times, I wanted to try outdoor brunch at Little Owl at some point. The only reservation left was at 9 am Saturday, so we tried to do a walk-in at 11:10 am, and after only a 5 min wait, we were able to snag a table outside for 2. The service was pretty good, with the servers being super sweet. Food, on the other hand, was quite unremarkable. My boyfriend got the grilled chicken sandwich, and I got pork enchiladas. We both thought they were so so, and we probably wouldn't come back here for brunch. For me, something also felt off about the beans in my salad."
4408,"Came with one other. My friend has been meaning to come here for awhile and made a reservation two weeks prior so I had some expectation. I looked thru Yelp and a few people pointed out that this is the ""friends"" apartment building. Cool, I like friends. Arrived a bit late but we were able to push back the reservation by 15 minutes to 12:45. We had indoor seats and wow it is a tight space. You're basically on top of each other. The hostess was super friendly and seated me before my friend got there. Server came over to ask if I wanted anything to drink immediately which I was grateful for. I ordered a tea with milk and sugar on the side. The menu was actually super appetizing. There were so many things I wanted to try. Alas,  we order the beignets, the French toast, the meatballs, and the squash. My friend was able to get a latte with oat milk. The squash was AMAZING - if you have to get anything, please please please order the squash. Forget about the popular items like the beignet and meatballs. The squash should be the star of the show. It was basically like a shashuka but had capers in it as well. It was DIVINE - get it! Anyway, the rest of the items were ok. You can't go wrong with French toast. Beignets were just meh. Meatballs had this blue cheese-esque taste to it, so wasn't a fan. We stayed until almost 2:30, which is a pretty long brunch I guess. The servers started coming by at some point every 15-20 minutes or so to check on us, basically to rush us. We asked to pack the beignets and they came back with a dirty container. We asked to replace the container and they just replaced the bottom part of the container. Then we had to ask for a bag. It was just so much back and forth, it was pretty frustrating. So while the squash was AMAZING, this place was just ok."
4409,"Ten stars for the way The Little Owl treats their customers. This place was so good I had to come back a week later. While we were dining an announcement was made that a couple there was celebrating their 39th anniversary, then a little while later another announcement was made that a couple just got engaged, all that followed by a champagne toast for everyone in the restaurant! The care and love they show towards their customers is second to none. Every establishment should show this much care. It's like being home.This place is definitely on my favorites list."
4410,"Excellent brunch, if you happen to be in West Village. I highly recommend getting the chilaquiles. The chips are crunchy and the sauce has a nice kick. Make reservations if you're coming for weekend brunch!"
4411,One of my favorite little spots in WV to grab lunch or a cozy dinner. Their octopus appetizer is to die for!
4412,"This has become a go-to neighborhood repeat spot for both dine-in and take-out, had wonderful experiences. A few highlight items on the menu is the Faroe Island Salmon (executed perfectly) and the Crispy Cornish Hen (could never make this at home so recommend it).  Martinis are good too.  Delightful outdoor seating and great service."
4413,"Such an amazing restaurant! Came in last year and was so pleased with every aspect of it. Service is amazing, food is amazing and the speed of service is so fast, you might even start asking yourself if you are at a fucking Mc Donald's because that food comes out Mc Fast as fuck. Joey, this one goes out to you! Great restaurant and I am very proud of what you have created. Everyone stop here at least once and do yourself a favor."
4414,"Definitely recommend coming here for happy hour! The sangria is amazing and $1 tapas allows you to try a little bit of everything. I loved all the tapas, especially the croquettes. Also fun fact: the restaurant is in the building where Friends was filmed!"
4415,"This is a cute little cafe where the Friends apartment is so there are a ton of people outside taking pictures all the time. We came for brunch and the food was just okay, and kind of mediocre at times.The meatball sliders that were supposed to be the highlight weren't really all that good. It tasted like overly starched up meatballs with too little sauce. The Poached eggs felt a little light though was tasty. Honestly the beignets were the highlight of the meal, being the only really good item. The Nutella and raspberry mix was pretty tasty."
4416,"Love the magic little owl.The only thing not great was Bucatini all'Amatriciana.. it was oily, big chunks of bacon which is a no no. Should be crispy bits of guanciale .. sauce was too heavy as well, also huge pieces of red onion and should be very small bits of minced white onion (so you don't notice) super disappointed, as it was the first time i had an inferior dish at the owl.Everything else, meatball sliders, crispy Brussel fries, kale tagliatelle and beignets were delightful as was the service."
4417,"Surprisingly... their hot chocolate is pretty salty and I can't even finished it.For the French toast, it tasted good."
4418,What a wonderful gem The inside is a small restaurant but the outside street eating is absolutely wonderful our party of three was very comfortable had heaters from the ceiling and two under the table our waitress was phenomenal those silver eyes and the hostess Tracy makes you feel like you've been there 100 times before warm and friendly excellent brunch I had the steak and eggs with brussels sprouts and potatoes side delicious pancakes like mom used to make the salad just enough coffee what is never ending the waitress entered every time with a smile and made us feel just loved looking forward to coming back of course I went to Little Owl in Singapore perhaps related?  Ty all
4419,"I'm sure I'm not saying anything new here so I will simply add to the chorus of accolades. Little Owl is a solid neighborhood eatery on a quiet West Village corner, serving comfort food staples. I had the delicious and gently fried soft shell crab sandwich which was on special that night. Take a look at the menu for their regular dishes.In the wake of the mess COVID has created for restaurants, Little Owl has made great use of the street and sidewalk with one of the nicest heated outdoor dining shelters I've seen in the city. They may have even increased their normal capacity by taking over a good portion of the street. I also appreciated the attention to detail. The fresh flowers on the table and little LED table lamp gave me something to photograph while I waited for the food. For two, we spent $100 on two entrees and two appetizers without wine. I felt this was quite reasonable given the location, quality of the food and the level of service."
4420,Super friendly atmosphere and delicious food... They really care about how they prepare things!
4421,"We had a fantastic brunch experience at Little Owl. We came in without a reservation (eep) but the hostess was very kind to find us a table indoors. The service was very attentive and the food was great! I got the chicken sandwich, and it was soooo flavorful, I loved the variety which included peppers and something spicy and greens and the potato fries were crunchy and very generous in portion. My husband got the smoked salmon scramble which he was very satisfied with. No wonder this place is such a neighborhood institution."
4422,"Actually started talking to a couple in the village while we were trying to find someplace to eat They told us how they just had a great meal at the little owl,so we wentWe were not disappointedThis cute corner townhome spot turned restaurant has a great neighborhood ambiance ,great service as well as delicious foodWe had the crispy chicken and Branzino fish along with a side of friesWe also enjoyed some beerWould definately go back again"
4423,"There's so much to like about the Little Owl, particularly the outstanding red snapper special with lobster risotto. But how do you think that delicate, lovely, perfectly seasoned entree would taste with pork chop gravy and mustard greens juice from a completely different dish running all over it? Dear reader, that's exactly what we experienced. My friend and I ordered those two (expensive) entrees, indicating we intended to share. Rather than receiving the two entrees, on their own plates for ourselves to divide as we saw fit, we were each given a plate upon which both entrees had been already split and mashed up against each other. While I appreciate that the restaurant was trying to be helpful, the delicate lobster risotto was polluted with pork chop juice. The liquid from the bitter greens flooded the fish and lobster, making it a totally different and less appetizing entree. I'm not usually obsessive about food touching, but when the kitchen thoughtlessly commingled two very disparate entrees upon the same plate, it made them far less pleasant to behold and consume. I wish they'd asked us before they did it. Even more unpleasant was how they slopped both leftover entrees into the same takeouts box. Now I have red snapper lobster risotto tumbled together with (overcooked) pork chops. Which I might feel cooler about if I hadn't paid more than $40 per entree. Little Owl, you could've afforded to give me two takeout containers. Also they packed the food so badly, the bottom of the bag was soaked with juice and fell apart during my 15 minute walk home."
4424,Worst restaurant I've been to in NYC... Horrible service and terrible overpriced food. Got the skirt steak and eggs - they didn't even ask how I wanted it cooked. I told them medium rare and it came out well done. Do not go here.
4425,"My partner and I came for our anniversary dinner under their heated outdoor dining setup (pet-friendly!)Lovely staff and was even greeted by the owner and chef. (Who turned out to be a big dog lover )We of course had to try their gravy meatball sliders -  so delicious!  and their Italian wedding soup. also very good, especially when eating outdoors. Petit filet mignon was perfect. Laying on top of cheesy potatoes.  My partner got the special of steak and papa bravas. We finished the meal sharing the graham cracker cheesecake. So many beautiful flavors. Nice hints of citrus mixed with the sweetness of the blueberries. Don't miss the sliders, filet mignon or the cheesecake."
4426,"Truly, a wonderful dining experience all around and I can't wait to come back. I made a reservation three days in advance. I arrived ten minutes early and was seated immediately- I didn't need to wait for my friend to arrive. That was a really nice bonus.For Covid-Concerned diners like me, I felt safe. There are screens between tables, and I could still smell the rubbing alcohol from my table when I sat down, which was a plus in my book. Our server provided us with paper straws so I didn't have to drink out of the glass. I could choose between reading the sanitized laminate menu or using a QR Code. We were also under a tent in case of rain and nice planters created a wall between the street and our dining accommodations. They didn't use gloves but I kept my hand sanitizer on the table and it really didn't bother me because the silverware was pre-wrapped in a napkin and I could drink out of a straw.The service was quick, accurate, friendly, and super patience with us while we asked lots of questions. The food was absolutely delicious. We had the pork enchiladas and beignets (both were Michelin Plate recommend online) and we got a side of bacon which was the best thick-cut perfectly-cooked bacon I've ever had, and an apple salad. We also had the refreshing sparkling Negroni and espressos to finish. Truly, a wonderful dining experience all around and I can't wait to come back."
4427,Loved the service and feel of this brunch place. I would recommend any and all salmon dishes as they are the best made. They were extremely attentive and my water was never empty. I really liked that they were able to sub in the salad for fries.
4428,"Amazing! First off the wait staff wears casual attire, bringing a 2021 flare to fine dining. The food was wonderful times 5 dishes. There isn't a full bar which is a negative but if you are a foodie, it can't be missed."
4429,"Outstanding brunch!  Wonderful outside seating, helpful and attentive staff, eclectic and interesting cocktails, yummy menu with something to please everyone. Our friends raved and said ""great find""!  Oh and it's in the Friends apartment building so don't be surprised if lots of folks stop to take your photo!"
4430,"My bf and I went here for a date night. It was perfect even during COVID. Since it was a weekday we were able to make a reservation the night before. However, we were running late, but the maitre d was very nice and accommodating! Also, the food was superb and above our expectations. For appetizer, we had ziti patricia and the portion was perfect for two. For our main courses, we had pork chop & buttered beans and crispy chicken with a side of mexican corn. Everything was cooked perfect and delicious. We highly recommend and will be returning soon."
4431,"Really great food! But the waitress offered us fries and made us feel that they were complementary, then charged us 10 dollars for them."
4432,Love their outdoor settings. I was excited to try the risotto but that was just ok. But the sliders and roasted corn are amazing.
4433,"Incredibly rude hostess on Friday night. We came by with a party of five, there were clearly seats available. One of us went up to the hostess stand to ask about seating and she literally shuffled the person to the curb! Ick. It took another five minutes to flag her down from the street, at which point she told us ten minutes but walked away before discussing inside/outside. Total miss. Rude."
4434,Great outdoor dining spot for COVID.  Great staff and a pleasant location to spend a long dinner.Solid food.
4435,Amazing! From the service to the delicious French toast! Such a breath of fresh air and a sigh of relief after my horrible attempt at a dining experience at Buvette around the corner. From the moment we walked in the door the waiter provided outstanding service and the food was cooked to perfection. The lattes were also made perfect! No negative comments. The food was really good and the bacon was on its own level of goodness! Give it a try! You won't regret it.
4436,"Beware - they are currently charging a 5% covid relief fee without telling you upfront about it and no indication on the menu. I'm more than happy to support restaurants get back to normal but don't do this. Be clear about the charge, where the money is going, just like you must tell patrons about an automatic gratuity for parties of a certain size. Sad, the food was great as was the service but feel taken advantage of and totally uncomfortable arguing about this when it's marked as covid relief (guilt trip)."
4437,"Wonderful experience.  We were seated faster than expected.  Sat outside.  Food was amazing.  Meatball sliders, watermelon salad and the fish special.  Great service and great food.  Worth the money."
4438,"Excellent COVID situation. We asked to be on the sidewalk and not in the wooden house/overhang, just for maximum airflow. There were heaters under the tables, which is really key and far more effective than just having heaters overhead (which they have as well). The bucatini amatriciana was very good. Our waiter was very accommodating with wines by the glass. At one point a traveling band stopped by and a waitress sang a duet with them, which was very fun! As a heads up, there is no liquor served here as it is near a school, so just wine, beer, and liqueur-based drinks. We are going back this week for a second time in as many months because it was so good."
4439,"Everything old is new again.Haven't been to Little Owl in 14 years.    We walk past it weekly, on our way to other places, but never thought to go back.SO GLAD WE DID.What a fabulous dinner for 4.   We had everything on the menu.  The meatball sliders are still as good as I remember.Crab cake special was just that, SPECIAL!Delicious kabocha squash with kale pesto.....Veal Marsala......a huge delicious lamb shank for a cold winter night and so much more.Great bottles of wine by the glass and by the bottle.Service was 5 star.  Friendly, knowledgeable and kind.....what a concept.;)Shout out to Theresa, the maitre d'.   So lovely.   Can't wait to go back.Little Owl, you are small, quaint, lovely and timeless.All restaurants could learn a thing or two from them."
4440,"Get the Box of Dreams!!This restaurant is busy so make a reservation beforehand or be prepared to wait 15-20 minutes! Went for lunch and got the box of dreams, sashimi lunch, and ice cream!1) Box of Dreams was amazing! Every bite had different flavors and everything tasted so good. It was like a mini omakase except much cheaper. My favorites are the yuzu pieces (salmon, scallop), the uni and ikura piece (uni was so sweet!), the toro scallion, and the amber jack (flavor bomb). It gets served with fresh wasabi which complemented the fish very well2) Sashimi lunch - every piece was fresh and came with a side salad and seaweed3) Ice cream - got the matcha and the sweet rice - both were yummy! The matcha one is rich and not too bitter and the sweet rice had bits of crispy rice in it"
4441,"Service was great! Attentive but not overbearing. We were sat at a table as they could not accommodate  bar seating that night, which was fine. We ordered 2 omakases  and everything came out on 2 long plates. The rice was cold which was my only complaint. Overall, good experience but my first experience was definitely better (at the sushi bar!)"
4442,"Definitely try to secure a reservation ahead of time if you're able to! My friend and I showed up a bit before opening and we had to wait a bit before getting seated. Hatsuhana seems to be a really popular lunch location.My friend said the ""Box of Dreams"" is what they're known for (and she thought it was really good!) but $48 was a little too much to commit to during lunch on a normal workday so I settled for the ""Salmon Lovers"" instead. The complementary miso soup was flavorful and opened my stomach more in preparation for the sushi set! Overall, I thought the sushi quality was good and fresh; the rice had the perfect amount of vinegar. The spicy miso sauce was tasty and elevated the taste of the regular salmon roll! Salmon and avocado is always a nice classic. Not sure if I could taste the difference between the king salmon (which is what they used for the nigiri) compared to regular salmon though.The food was satisfying, and I'd say this was a great option to splurge for food during lunch without getting a food coma."
4443,"Hatsuhana is good for sashimi rather than sushi.   I prefer sushi rolls over sashimi, but still enjoyed my sashimi.  If you are not sure what to try, order the Box of Dreams, which is 9 different pieces of sashimi+sushi (mostly sashimi) in a cute wooden box.  It's so pretty to look at that you almost don't want to eat it.  Almost.1 star off: I went on a weeknight when the restaurant was only about half full, but it still took about 45 minutes to get our food.  Service is definitely not on a roll."
4444,"I ordered the special dish today which were the oysters. The waiter told us it was huge but we didn't believe him until we received the oysters. The oysters were really really delicious and the sauce was amazingggggggg! It was $10 per oyster. I also had the box of dreams ($50) which was really good, I wish they had raw shrimp instead of cooked shrimp! My favorite from the box was the salmon and scallop!"
4445,"Possibly the top contender for one of the best sushi experiences I've ever had! I came right at opening without a reservation and they were happy to make accommodations for my party. It seemed to get very busy throughout the meal so I will definitely make one next time I come. The waitress was happy to answer any questions we had and to go over what the specials of the day were.For the appetizer, we shared an unagi kyuri maki which is a piece of eel wrapped in cucumber. The eel, which was coated by the classic eel sauce, was perfectly balanced by the fresh cucumber - definitely a unique way to elevate an eel cucumber roll. For my entree, I got one of their most popular items, the box of dreams. It  truly lived up to its name - each bite melted in my mouth and had my eyes rolling back in satisfaction. My favorites were the toro and the uni. I love the little wooden box it comes in! My friend got the sushi and sashimi combo which he also really enjoyed.Definitely a top class meal in terms of quality and presentation. We left with our bellies full and both agreed that we will be returning, possibly for their omakase. I saw a few people dining solo and honestly, if I worked/lived in the area, I would probably come every week just to have a meal there!"
4446,"Special Occasion, special restaurant! We reserved for a dinner that marks our ""one year since we met"" anniversary on what ended up being a cold, snowy night. It must be mentioned that a no-show results in a $40 charge, so better show up on time! The restaurant feels modern and yet traditional, with a courteous and helpful staff at one's service. We ordered the miso soup to begin with. And for entrees, we opted for the sushi dinner which comes with two rolls of your choice, and salmon+tuna+yellowtail nigiri. We had the spicy tuna and yellowtail scallion rolls, and I have to say these might be the best sushi rolls we've ever had. The presentation and taste were both excellent. I normally don't even like nigiri that much, but this time I gulped it all down happily! The other dish, the salmon Mother and Child Don Buri, is an excellent choice, with sushi grade salmon and roe served on a bed of tasty sushi rice. It might feel a little costly for what ultimately isn't of a large portion but the taste makes up for it. We loved it here, and since it wasn't exactly a cheap meal I'm not sure we'll be here again. But I do highly recommend for some high quality sushi dishes. Excellent for special occasions, even."
4447,"Have wanted to visit here forever and finally got the chance to try it over the summer! It can be more casual or more of a celebratory spot for sure. We came without reservations and got seated without a wait. However, the wait for the food itself was a bit longer than expected so our meal took longer than we thought it would. We ordered a roll and the box of dreams. The roll was super fresh and nice to go along with the more raw options from the box. We definitely could have gone without it, but we didn't feel uncomfortably full from ordering this additional dish. The box was great - there are multiple pieces of each item so it was easy to share. Everything was pretty fresh as well! Like the variety of options and would recommend splitting with someone. Another friend of mine also loves this place and she's allergic to seafood! But she'll come here so I guess that shows how good this place is. Definitely a top sushi (non omakase) spot that I would return to!"
4448,"Food: Box of Dreams. This is their specialty and I've never seen this presentation anywhere else before. It's beautifully prepared with each type of fish seasoned approximately on top of sushi rice. Get the one with (9) and not the mini with (6). Fish is delicious and fresh. They will prepare to your liking so if you don't like something specific (I don't like uni) just tell them and they'll adjust it.  Hubby ordered sushi and although it was good, he regretted not getting this box!Ambiance: seats are a bit close together upstairs but it was nicely minimalist. Service: very friendly and accommodating. Would definitely return when in NYC!"
4449,"If there is one place to go to for real authentic sushi in NYC, look no further. At times it can be incredibly busy but I was able to call and get a table for 4. Perfect setting for a casual business lunch. Oh and for those visiting NYC over the weekend, extend your stay to include a Monday or Friday as they are closed over the weekend. But trust me, it's worth it. All the food, especially the sushi is super fresh. Service is impeccable and always with a smile. Maybe a little on the pricey side but you know you are going to pay for good sushi. I have not sat at the sushi bar as I have always been with other people. Maybe next time. The dining room is a little tight (for a big dude like me) but then it does take me back to my time visiting Japan. Can't wait to go back again soon."
4450,The service is amazing and I felt like I was in Japan. The waiters are so friendly and helpful. The sushi is such high quality and very fresh. Everything they served was delicious and satisfying. The box of dreams was beautifully made and they use fresh wasabi as well!
4451,"I came to one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city  for my birthday dinner last week with my bf.We ordered and shared:- Box of Dreams- Box of Dreams Mini- Tempura- Miso Soup x2We had a lovely experience and the sushi was delicious, as usual.With the Box of Dreams Mini, you can choose the 6 kinds of fish you want, which I really like. You can't choose with the Box of Dreams, but we were very happy with the selection.The uni, which was in both, was perfection. The fatty tuna was one of my favorites, too.We were still talking about how delicious the sushi was the following day. Looking forward to dining here again soon :)"
4452,"Finally am able to rave about this place!! Decided to go for the box of dreams full size which comes with 9 small bowls each with fish such as tamago, tuna, fatty tuna, salmon, scallop, and Uni. It's filling; the ambience is more on the quieter side but servers are friendly and helpful!! Not expensive for what you get considering you're in Manhattan. Check it out!!"
4453,"Good quality but pricey! Ordered the ""box of dreams"" that is super popular and was not disappointed. However, for the price you are paying, I guess it is expected. Just take note that it isn't a lot of food but you are paying for quality."
4454,"Hatsuhana is a great choice for Seamless Orders -- probably one of the best sushi delivery in Midtown Manhattan. However, it terms of sit down dining it's decent but you definitely can find better sit down sushi places in Manhattan given there are so many of them. The box of dreams was indeed really good and filling (there are sushi rice at the bottom of each dish). Would highly recommend for anyone looking to order sushi takeout (I personally used to do Hatsuhana Fridays )"
4455,"Amazing experience from start to finish! This was the first sushi experience I had in NYC and it definitely did not disappoint. The waiters and waitresses were all extremely attentive, the timing of the food coming out was stellar, and the food itself was phenomenal! Great cocktails, great fish. Definitely will be coming back!"
4456,"Amazing!!!! The waitress was so friendly and knowledgeable. She suggested that I have the fried soft shell crab, my first time, and I cannot stop thinking about it. I also had the ""box of dreams"". So delicious. The sushi was incredibly fresh too! So tasty and succulent!"
4457,"Hatsuhana has been on my list for years, but I didn't have the chance to go until now. I made a reservation on resy for two and added a special request for the window seat if it's available. When we arrived, we were led upstairs to where a  window seat was. I ordered their box of dreams ($46) and my friend ordered their sushi deluxe ($43) with an extra otoro ($12). We were given hot towels to wipe our hands before the meal. Miso soup was also served first and our food cameshortly after. The sushi was so fresh and I was really satisfied! The servers were very attentive and kept checking up on us throughout the meal."
4458,"Hatsuhana boasts that its the oldest sushi restaurant in NYC and is routinely packed, so much so that reservations need to be made at least a few days in advance.  After many years of wanting to give it a try, the family headed in to see if the fuss is warranted.When we arrived, we were greeted enthusiastically and guided to our table by the wonderful staff.  Once seated, we were immediately given hot towels and drinks.  In terms of food, we got the wagyu special sushi (12 bucks a piece - good but probably not worth the price) as well as the seaweed salad.  The seaweed salad isn't your average seaweed salad - it's 3 or 4 different kinds of seaweed in a light soy dressing that also has the neon green sweet one that most diners are familiar with.  It's different but pretty good.  When it came to entrees, it's hard to pass up on their box of dreams (a box of assorted fish on sushi rice).  The box of dreams was fresh and the presentation was beautiful.  The fish quality at Hatsuhana is really quite good and the continued longevity and popularity of this restaurant is a testament to that.If I had to nitpick, the sushi rice here is shockingly subpar.  It's a bit hard and under seasoned.  Some of my bites tasted like plain white rice which was a bit disappointing.  In terms of value, the prices are pretty high for non-Omakase offerings (50 bucks on average for most entrees).  The decor and vibe is also really dated, it reminds me of what Japanese restaurants looked like when I was a kid in the 80's.  The service however is top notch.  It's definitely worth a try, especially if you like more traditional sushi and not the more modern fusion stuff."
4459,"Hatsuhana's ""Box of Dreams"", and it really is a box of dreams because it was so pretty I didn't want to touch it. We also ordered the Sushi Hatsuhana ""Pick 10"" and it was delicious! You can pick any 10 nigiris from the list they have. Salmon Carpaccio is also a very good appetizer to share. This spot will not really make you full, but we left the place satisfied."
4460,"Sometimes you just have to treat yourself. Apparently that's what I was thinking when I booked a table for 2 at Hatsuhana. We arrived shortly before 8 PM on Friday night and were shown upstairs to a lovely two-top next to the sushi counter. We shared a seaweed salad appetizer and sipped Sapporo while studying the menus. Omakase is between $100-150 depending on how many pieces you want. There are also a variety of combination options, including the famous Box of Dreams, which we did end up ordering. You can also order a la carte, piece by piece. In addition to the Box of Dreams, we also started with a Pick-10-nigiri plus eel roll. My girlfriend handled the shellfish while I took a liking to the trout, salmon, mackerel, and unagi. The textures and flavors were ideal; high quality fish, and the chefs know what they're doing. It's a rare treat to taste bluefin, and I went a little overboard ordering otoro and chutoro, along with the special Chilean sea bass. Outstanding. You can run the tab up pretty fast ordering a la carte, so proceed with caution. Hatsuhana is a great place to ball out, either for a fancy date, dinner with beloved family and friends, or an impressive business meal. The atmosphere, service, and food quality are worth the price. I also adore the unassuming location. Hoping to return again someday."
4461,"Went hear having heard that this is one of the longest standing sushi places in the city. Unsure about how true that is but this place was definitely authentic to its culture which we experienced not only in the food but also in how we were greeted in Japanese by the servers and chefs as we got to our reserved table.Went here on a Friday at 6pm and the place started packing rather quickly. By the time we were done with our meal, it was a full house.Upon being seated, we were given fresh, wet towels (as we do on planes) which was a really nice gesture. I also loved the cutlery and crockery used since it was were uncommon and therefore exotic.For food, I got the Pick 10 with 2x Salmon nigiri, 1x Tuna, 1x Uni, 2x Eel, 1x Scallop, 1x Octopus, 1x Tamago (but I think they accidentally gave me 2), 1x Spanish Mackerel and for the roll, I got the Yellowtail Roll as per our server's recommendation of it being a popular choice. My favorites of the Pick 10 were the Eel, Salmon and Spanish Mackerel. The rest were pretty average and wouldn't be repeated given another choice. Since I'm a fan of Eel, I knew I was going to enjoy it, however I wish there were no bones in the nigiri as I prefer not having to chew on them. The flavor however was there so I'm trying not to hold a grudge on this one. I went in thinking of getting one of the Spicy rolls from the list or the Eel roll, however I got the Yellowtail one as per our server's suggestion but unfortunately it was bland and boring. Their Eel, spicy Salmon and spicy Tuna rolls were definitely a lot nicer (still not the best I've had in the city) which I got to try a bite off of my friends' orders to know what I was missing out on. As we ended our meals, we got a cup of hot green tea which I really appreciated. For desserts, we got one of both the only options they had, and that wasn't a wise move since both tasted 90% (if not more) identical. The red beans added a nice texture and the matcha green tea ice cream was sweet and on the milky side. Inside there were also a few plain mochi-like rice domes that added a chewy texture. This was alright but since I've had better matcha ice cream, I'm biased in my views! Decent visit especially for a first (and maybe only) time!"
4462,I stopped by for dinner and was not disappointed. I sat upstairs. The environment felt authentic. The sushi & sake were really good. This is a great find in midtown! They have appealing lunch specials.
4463,"Hatsuhana is considered as the oldest sushi restaurant in New York.  They opened when there weren't that many competitions unlike now.  Many of Japanese restaurants that opened around the same time as Hatsuhana are no longer in business.  I'm pleased to say this though - this restaurant never lost touch after all these years, constantly making improvements on their menu to adjust to evolving tastes of targeted audience.  My current favorite item is box of dreams.  Truly innovative and something I'd definitely recommend.Decor could use some facelifting but that's not the end of the world.  I've seen far worse than that (like.... Gyu-kaku?)  Truly hats off to them for still bringing the A game.  I hope they'll stay that way.  And will you please open on weekends?"
4464,"We wandered in on Thursday night at 7pm with no reservation and were fortunate to get a table here. The manager was truly warm and kind, our server Amin, was too.  The fish was so fresh, perfectly sliced, tender and flavorful. It is very traditional sushi. We ordered the deluxe sushi dinner, with 10 pieces of sushi and a tuna roll, plus the salmon appetizer and this special fatty tuna sushi, It was so good, we did a second order. You pay for the quality, but it was the best meal of the trip."
4465,"Okay, don't walk, but run, to Hatsuhana if you want to taste superb sushi. My coworker and I were expecting goodness but did not know we would be eating greatness. We shared the King Crab Avocado Salad ($15), which was very flavorful and perfectly textured. My coworker had the Box of Dreams ($46), which he loved and said that each of the little bowls were very good quality and delicious. I had the Sushi Deluxe ($43) with the yellowtail scallion roll as my choice of roll, and the sushi was truly spectacular and such high quality.  The food does not look like a lot, but it is filling and perfect for a lunch that won't leave you with a food coma. The lunch is an experience though, and we spend about 1.75hrs there (although you can definitely eat faster, but the sushi was totally savor-worthy!). Highly recommend Hatsuhana, and the service was great too."
4466,"Great quality fish compared to similarly priced sushi restaurants in the city! Overall, no hiccups in the whole dining experience Service (5/5) - Just did a walk in for lunch for a group of 3, and though it was a tight squeeze, the receptionist was super sweet about it and did everything he could to get me and my friends seated. Even though we stayed a little longer than the time he asked us to finish by (since they had a reservation right after us) it didn't feel like they were rushing us out at all. Food came out fast and servers were also very cheerful. Ambiance (5/5) - Super clean, traditionally decorated and relaxed environment that works well for casual meals or nice dates. Food (5/5) - I personally got the chirashi, but you can get the box of dreams if you're looking for something a little more extravagant and filling. Both are tasty, stunning, and the selection is very fresh. Even the vegetables were yummy! Definitely get these if you like taking pictures of your food. I would say both are a good deal compared to what you get from similar establishments in the area."
4467,"I felt like I was in Japan at Hatsuhana (yes I've been to Japan!). The ambiance, warm towels, tea, and of course the sushi was the real deal. It was very busy for lunch (reservation required). There are so many ""package"" lunch deals to choose from with combinations of nigiri, rolls, sashimi (and all come w soup or salad). I live in SF and will go out of my way to come back next time i'm in new york!"
4468,Box of Dreams was excellent. Super aesthetic and great quality. The fish melts in your mouth and is incredibly fresh. The tuna was my favorite. I also quite liked the rice - right amount of stickiness. The tuna roll was also very good. Solid value at $46. Fish quality is as good as Sushi Noz's but much better value. 10/10 recommend.
4469,"I love it! We loved it! I am so sorry, I was so excited. Because for the COVID-19 situation, we didn't had much Raw fish for a loooooooonh time! I happened in the city today and searched for nearby sushi places. This location I have been to few times for dine in, I loved it because the price, the quality of the food and the service, of course, location is great too. Most ppl would say delivery sushi is not a good choice because the raw fish may change taste or turn bad after it arrive home. I got it and got home after 30 mins, it still tasted delicious and fish are great.  I would highly recommend it if you like sushi. Look at the photo, they are good as it looks."
4470,"The Box of Dreams is the best dish at this restaurant! Wonderful portions with a lovely variety of sushi in each box, delicious taste, and reasonable price ($48). Their tempura appetizers are a nice way to start the meal. I love that they always have complimentary hot tea, which always pairs well with sushi, but the sake selection is also great! Service was a little slow, especially as the restaurant got busier. Reservation recommended; as it seemed pretty much all tables had a Reservation sign. Very satisfied with my meal here, and it's probably one of the better sushi restaurants in the city. Would definitely recommend for a nice date night!"
4471,"Highly recommend!! Booked a reservation about a week in advance for an exciting Valentine's night dinner with my partner. The sushi was absolutely delicious and the service was top notch. The attention to detail was impeccable and the dining experience was exactly what we were looking for. For a date night, a night out or a family dining experience, I'd definitely check out Hatsuhana!"
4472,"It's mid, food is like kinda okay, omakase came out all at once so it's not really omakase, costs 120 but probably worth 40-60"
4473,Dining in is so magical. I love all their beautiful ceramics. Tasty soy sauce. Amazingly smooth tea. Great service. Decadent fish. I order the box of Dream because I was starving. I almost had to be rolled out of there. The uni is so fresh and tasty. This is the second place in New York where I feel the uni is impeccable. They have the most amazing fish I've ever had. I was texted my sister about it. Planning on taking her here when she visits.
4474,"My son is a huge sushi lover and Hatsuhana Sushi Restaurant was a 3-minute walk from the hotel we stayed in. It was an easy choice because of its accessibility to us and many glowing reviews. We had a 5:30pm reservation with them, and were one of the first patrons to arrive. We were greeted kindly at the front desk and shown to our table. We knew right off what we were getting and ordered sake, two Box of Dreams and mini Box of Dreams for me. We wanted to try their tempura but they had a broken fryer that evening. They indulged us with warm hand towels before bringing our dinner to us. The boxes came to us quick. I wasn't being very adventurous and quickly chose the sushi that I was most comfortable with for my mini box. I ordered the shrimp, Toro, shrimp, and Spanish mackerel. I was undecided on my other two - staff there suggested I try the sea urchin and sea scallops. I was ok with trying those as well. The Box of Dreams for my husband and son came with a pre set sushi. All the seafood was high quality. I'm so glad I went with their suggestion to try the scallops. It tasted nothing like the scallops we get in packs from big box stores. I never had tasted such fresh tasting scallops before. It was sublime! Everything was great as well. A big shout out to their staff who served us that night. We were very touched by their hospitality. They offered us good suggestions when we asked for it, and took great care of us throughout the evening. Thank You!"
4475,"I'm starting to think this restaurant is operating under the radar even though it got 3 stars from The New York Times many years ago. The food is consistently excellent and service is first rate.  I'm only reviewing it for the second time because I've been going there consistently for some months and it is absolutely terrific.  It'll take a little work to get a reservation but it's entirely worth it, and I recommend it unreservedly. The real deal."
4476,"I came here on a date many years ago, the quality of food and the customer service was excellent. I've been wanting to go back again but haven't gotten chance to since the pandemic. I hope their food and service hasn't changed."
4477,"This is truly the best sushi/sashimi/nigiri I have ever had in my life. If you want to try extremely fresh fish in a clean and inviting atmosphere, this is the place to go in NYC. I can't speak highly enough about the quality of their sushi.This is the standard by which I judge every sushi place, and literally no one else has come close."
4478,Food is good Everything They don't treat their employees right my Dad is just work here almost a year he asked 4 day off which his General manager said no my Dad have go to this Main boss ask him when he came back from Vacation he doesn't have job They told him don't come no Termination letter no nothing . So very Poor staffing if you looking to work over here highly recommended don't come here. If you go on family trip couple day mean you don't have Job too when you come back that's is Crazy we live in America !!!
4479,"Great delight! This is my second time here and it never disappoints me. I love the idea of box of dreams that you can try 9 different types of sashimi at the same time, especially food for people who love exploring. The quality of the fish is really good and I like the Yuzu sauce paired with scallop. It's great value for money as well as similar portion and quality could potentially cost 25% more somewhere else."
4480,UPDATE: Tried the Box of Dreams a couple weeks ago and it was AMAZING!! Would highly recommend! All of the fish melted in my mouth and was SUPERB quality!
4481,"Went twice in a past weeks and again absolutely incredible lunch. Worth every penny, fresh, clean, reliable, perfect quality and amazing portion.Sushi lover it's a must.Thank you for the both time. Will be back soon"
4482,"What an experience! Was craving sushi for awhile and this place really hit the spot. Our server was exceptionally kind and friendly. As for the indoor seating, even though there were glass barriers, it still felt a bit cramped; enough for everyone to hear their neighbors conversation. So, probably not the best place for a first date but definitely for a second or third. :)"
4483,"I ordered the sushi deluxe for delivery and it was amazing. I did not have high expectations since sushi delivery is pretty hit or miss, but I really enjoyed every piece of fish. It is pretty reasonable for what you get ($38) and my favorite pieces were the scallop and king salmon. The pieces don't come with any special sauces, which I would have enjoyed, but I got spicy Mayo on the side to use sparingly. The spicy tuna roll was also very good, but a little small. All of the fish was very fresh. It is also worth paying $10 more to get the sushi deluxe since it came with 2 pieces of toro. I would definitely recommend ordering from this restaurant."
4484,Great experience! Chefs were nice and knowledgeable on the fish they were preparing. Drinks were good and quality of food was delicious!
4485,"An unassuming sushi restaurant with impeccable service, friendly staff, and a clean restaurant.This place doesn't have the ""wow"" factor when it comes to ambiance, and it doesn't have the pomp and circumstance of so many trendy Japanese spots in the city- i.e. Nobu, Mr. Chow, Tao. However, its simplicity and quality is refreshing. It's not trying to be a sceney spot where tourists flock, and I appreciate that.Upon arrival, I was greeted by the host and complimentary coat check, where they proceeded to escort me upstairs to my reserved table. At 6pm, it was relatively empty, but by 6:30/7, the place was full! The restaurant is big, sprawling over two stories.Immediately when I sat down, our waiter brought over a warm towel for our hands. They also served complimentary green tea!For mains, I ordered the vegetarian maki, and my friend got the sashimi. Both were very fresh and delicious. I did ask for brown rice for mine, but they don't have any, which was the only bummer of the evening.Service was attentive yet not overbearing. We ended up staying well after we finished our meal, and we weren't rushed out despite the now-packed restaurant.I will happily be back to Hatsuhana!"
4486,"Such a great sushi joint, extremely fresh and delicious. I recommend the box and share it with everyone."
4487,"My boyfriend and I dined here to celebrate his birthday and it was definitely a great choice! Hatsuhana may be a more upscale Japanese restaurant, but its overall presentation evokes comfort and understated elegance. The din of the restaurant is tolerable for conversation, and service is impeccable yet unintrusive. I liked the fact that the two of us were seated in an alcove by the back of the restaurant, making for a more intimate dinner. We had both planned on getting the Box of Dreams, Hatsuhana's star dish. I was tempted but I decided that it was way too much fish for me and I wanted to enjoy everything fresh. We both ordered the Kaisen Chirashi which contained an assortment of fish, including white tuna, salmon, masago, tuna, and clam. I was pleasantly surprised that the chirashi was a 2 tier dish.It was very filling! I loved the amaebi, the salmon, and the uni, but all the fish has that melt-in-your mouth texture that speaks of its freshness and superb quality. The meal was on the pricier side, but the high prices are justified given the quality. I now understand why so many people love to dine her."
4488,"Best sushi place! The Otoro sushi blew my mind! I tried Otoro many times in Japan and I was surprise they served melt in your mouth Otoro better than the ones in Japan. Also service was great the waiter recommended a special off the menu seared fish, delicious!"
4489,Awesome food and service but but cheap. Consistent for over 20 years of my experience.
4490,"I am here again to praise Hatsuhana . Due to recent changes in Covid19 restaurant regulations, they are now open and taking reservations for dine in!! Last night, I was here celebrating a friends birthday.My experience was absolutely wonderful. All the staff greeted us with very positive energy and although masks were being worn, I could tell that the hostess had a natural affability towards guests. Our server was delightful and amenable. Our party had many questions about the menu and she proved to be very knowledgable and helpful to us through out the entire meal. The food is always fresh and tastes great which is why I always come back to Hatsuhana! This time I tried the sashimi deluxe, the day's most exceptional eight variety assortment decided by the executive chef ! If you read my other review, I explain that every time I visit Hatsuhana, there is something new on the menu! Which brings me to try new dishes each time. So, if you're interested in the dishes I had last night, quickly make your reservation to visit before it's too late! I really appreciate your staff and team for opening up your doors to us and providing great food and service. Thank you!"
4491,"Does this place need more reviews? Anyways just wanted to add my 2cents in this fountain. Came here for lunch for three without a reservation and got a seat no problem. The restaurant is a sooo much bigger than I thought and only found out after I had to use the bathroom upstairs. There are more tables and a sushi bar upstairs. For the food, they serve everyone green tea and it was so good I drank so many cups. I got the box of dreams($45) which is nine small separate chirashi bowls and my companions each got the kaisen chirashi ($35)Although this isn't an ""omg soo good, I can eat this forever"" sushi, it is a very good mid tier ""finally quality sushi"" place. Would definitely come back if I got the chance!"
4492,"This place has ruined sushi for me in the best way. Some of the best sushi I have ever had! The fish is very fresh, the servers were exceptionally helpful, the plating is absolutely beautiful, etc etc etc wonderful amazing stellar! We ordered the Box of Dreams and the Sushi deluxe and both were mind blowing. We went on a Tuesday night and waited about 10 minutes which tells how busy this place can get. But the hostess was very polite and made the wait feel like nothing. I think the next time I visit, I will l be doing their omakase menu. We sat next to the bar and I was green with envy; everything looked delicious."
4493,"Came in on a Friday night for a friend's birthday dinner with a reservation for 6:30 for a party of 7. We skipped the apps and went straight for the entrees. Prior to coming in, we all thought we wanted the box of dreams ($48). This is literally a box with 9 little bowls of at least 9 different varieties of sashimi, served over sushi rice. But then our waitress threw us for a loop and recommended the Sushi Deluxe ($45) - ten pieces of nigiri and a roll. I went with this one because I figured it would be less rice than the box. I really enjoyed it (except the ikura one, but I'm also not a fan of ikura). I'm also glad I ended up getting this one because the box of dreams had the cooked cold shrimp and the sweet egg thing, which I do not care for. My fiancé got the box (he liked it) and I still got my IG-worthy shot of it.At the end of the meal, they brought the birthday girl some mochi ice cream, so that was a nice touch. Next time, I may splurge and get their omakase (which at $100 for 15 pieces/$120 for 18 pieces is very reasonably priced, compared to a lot of other higher end sushi spots)."
4494,"Pretty legit, it's like you can come here and get the best of the best.  You just want all bluefin/akami,chutoro,toro in a donburi?  They got it.  Various uni, got it.  Rice is on point.  Pricing is average.  Box of dreams very pretty.  Atmosphere a bit stuffy...but it was a good experience.  Maybe could use some music...Service was good."
4495,"Although I'm a vegetarian (which means that I also abstain from consuming seafood), I've come by here a few times within the past couple of years. Mostly because my dining companions greatly enjoy sushi, and if it's the other party's special day, you shut up and go to the restaurants they want to go to.I last came here about a month ago for my mother's birthday. I definitely recommend making reservations ahead of time as it's always been pretty busy whenever I've gone. Surprisingly enough, I've always had enough to eat as they offer a vegetarian maki selection, though I can't imagine anybody coming here solely for that. It seems like one of the most popular items on the menu is their box of dreams, which comes in a pick 6 or 9 size. I imagine a lot of people get it to take pictures for the 'gram. My mother opted for the pick 6 version of their box of dreams, while my brother got the full 9. The bf decided to get a salmon donburi bowl, while I got my requisite veggie maki set.My mother is a very picky eater, but she thought her fish selections were excellent. She liked every item in her box of dreams selection, and that's what mattered most to me. The rest of my party enjoyed their respective selections as well, and I imagine I would come back with either my mother, or my friends who I've come here with in the past. Worth a visit if you happen to be in the mood for good sushi that won't absolutely break the bank, though yes, this place is not exactly cheap, either.Now, if only they could expand their bathrooms..."
4496,"Roll sizes are small and not fresh. I ordered two rolls for takeout and although service was great, I was disappointed by the quality. The rolls had 6 small pieces- shrimp tempura roll barely had shrimp tempura! Rolls looked unappetizing"
4497,"What an authentic dining experience!I am by no means a sushi connoisseur, but even I was able to tell that Hatsuhana's fish was nothing short of amazing and the friend I dined with was able to attest to this. The ambience is perfect for either a date or an intimate family/friend gathering. Our server was also very polite and patient, giving us suggestions of what to order and explaining the dishes when served. We ordered the ever-popular box of dreams and the sashimi deluxe. The box was surely what dreams are made of and if you are someone who likes to share food at every meal, this would be a great choice. There were enough pieces per selection for my friend and I to both try. The sashimi deluxe came with 8 chef-selected nigiri and a roll of our choice- we got yellowtail. After stuffing our faces with fish and rice, we chose to order the icecream sandwich. The 'bread' of the sandwich was, light and crispy, reminiscent of a soft serve cone, serving as a vessel for the matcha icecream and a red bean topping. It also came with a side of 2 matcha mochis.I would HIGHLY recommend this place for a great night of sushi and if you want to impress your friends with your delectable taste in Japanese cuisine :) It was totally affordable and worth every $."
4498,"What this place does well is the middle tier sushi. I feel like you normally either have really expensive omakase (over 100 bucks) or pretty cheap sushi where it's borderline sushi.This place fits right in the middle, where if you want some better sushi but it's not a special occasion and you don't want to splurge that much.Got the box of dreams and the quality of the fish was indeed pretty good. It's not like omg good, but it's like ""ah yes, quality sushi"". They also all come out at once, and if you're very particular of sushi, you want it to be as fresh as possible and even letting it sit kind of ruins it (temperature wise). Also got the 10 piece deluxe in which you get to choose the pieces, and there were a lot of similar pieces. It's not as intimate as really nice omakase places, but what can you expect when it's like 50 a person.I'd recommend this to folks looking to either get into sushi or just want a place more casual"
4499,"I came here with a party of 3 with reservations and had a wonderful experience. The moment you walk in from when you sit down, you are greeted by staff and it gives you the typical traditional cozy Japanese restaurant vibe. We all chose the ""pick 10"" which allows you to choose anything you want on a list of different fish to choose from PLUS one sushi roll. The max you can get of each fish is 2. I went with... uni, sweet ebi, salmon, trout, scallop, and 2 others that I cannot recall the name of. I also chose the eel roll. My favorites belonged to the uni, sweet ebi, and scallop. I also love how the meal comes with some hot green tea (refillable) *drool*. The seafood is fresh and I honestly find this an amazing deal. I dont think its the best sushi I have ever had but for the price, I would say this is the best deal I've had. Then you add on the amazing service and wow, definitely would be coming back! Staff are extremely friendly too! I also felt a little past content after finishing my meal which is exactly where I like to be.Side note: if you want toro, that is not included in the pick 10. you would have to choose the sushi deluxe for that to be your option."
4500,"5/5!! Best experience and amazing desserts here. I came on a weekday night and luckily there was no line. I went and got seated at the bar to watch Chika do her magic and her attention to detail is surreal. My whole experience there was so much fun and fascinating as well. I got the fromage blanc which is their ""cheesecake"" and it was amazing. Super light and like a foam. So. AMAZING. They also serve it on top of ice which was perfect. I also got the doughYAKI which is a creme brûlée donut and it was so cute! Soft and creamy and warm to the heart. You can watch Chika prepare and they have the best plates here. I cant wait to be back and try even more desserts and see you Chika!"
4501,"It was good but for the price, it was a bit underwhelming.Food - 3/5Dessert are pricey for what you get. I ordered what came out to be 2 spoons of ice cream in a plastic cup with a shot of espresso for $11.Ambiance 5/5Both jndoor and outdoor dining available. Glass partition between tables indoor. A little small but cozyService 4/5I think waiter meant well but he could come off as a bit rude. The rest of the staff was really friendly. Everyone was wearing mask and following protocols"
4502,"I had really high hopes for this place but I came away pretty underwhelmed. I tried four things:Doughyaki creme brûlée donut: my favorite one. The texture was soft and gooey on the inside and the flavor was spot on! Cheesecake: this was good but nothing crazy. It's a lot lighter than a normal cheesecake and tastes more like a cheesecake mousse.Panna cotta: veryy underwhelming. Would not recommend, it wasn't bad but just boring.Chocolate chip cookie: a good chocolate chip cookie for sure, but not better than a lot of other choco cookies in New York.Overall, everything was okay but the bill (with tax and tip) came out to $60...... definitely NOT worth the price in my opinion.Very disappointed, my friend came here before and raved about it but she said she got the set menu last time. She was disappointed by the desserts this time around as well."
4503,"I feel pretty bad giving this two stars, but this review is for people like me who rely on review sites like this for food choices. But I ordered a plethora of desserts for my birthday in lieu of a full cake and boy did I regret it. The strawberry shortcake was dry, not as good as somewhere cheaper like Paris Baguette/Martha's Bakery. The banana creme puff is nothing compared to what you can get at Bibble and Sip. The famous doughYAKI arrived wet and limp. The mille crepe cake is like eating grocery store cake in comparison to a place like Harbs. The only thing that stood out was the tablespoon portion of vanilla sorbet that came as a side for an item called Chocolate Righteousness ($17 for a TINY portion). I didn't even take pics of everything I was so annoyed!It was a pretty sad sight overall. I hate when I'm willing to spend $$$$ for a standard of quality, but I didn't even get that. I ended up ordering Harbs after because none of it hit the spot."
4504,"We came to Chikalicious to try the dessert tasting, but upon arriving were notified that it wasn't available for our reservation. We ordered the strawberry shortcake, crepe cake, and the cocktail of the day, which was sparkling wine with a frozen strawberry cube. The desserts were good but not great, and the cocktail was underwhelming. The service was fine but could have been better considering that we were the only people in the dessert bar. The ambiance was a little bit strange - it is quite a small room and the tables are very close together and felt a little tight. There wasn't much room to move around and we could see into the back of the kitchen from our table. Overall the food was not bad but nothing impressive."
4505,"We visited this place on a double date. Looks to be very upscale, server certainly got a sense of humor. Food here are very special. Pepper with peach is mind blowing. Mille cake is certainly comparable (or even better) than Lady M's. ""Cheesecake"" is more like foamed creamy milk. Strawberry shortcake is so cute!"
4506,"They open outdoor siting.The desserts all delicious. Since it the Covid-19 Era, you can just ordered anything on the menu without doing drink paring like before when you come you have to do tasting menu. The service was good. Just make sure there some dessert place across the street with have more sit, but it's not the same one . Come early so the wait won't be so long ."
4507,GuysLike IMMA KEEP IT REAL AND SHORT..This cheesecake made my husband cry because it was that good. I'm not a cheesecake kinda gal but I was eating this like I was. Not heavy not dense...if I can compare this to something....I would compare it to eating clouds..soft and fluffy and not too sweet and not too cheeeesy
4508,"Great dessert spot and great business overallDessert first... The crepe cake was moist and delicious.  The donut is not a share size, great flavor and taste really enjoyed it.  If I had to choose just one (but why would you really need to) I would go for the crepe cake.  Something about seeing all those thin slices makes it even more decadent!Cutest mini outdoor table set up, staff is all friendly and helpful.  Definitely a go to spot!"
4509,Amazing place for girls night out! Everything was good. Wasn't overwhelmingly sweet either. We did the desserts with wine pairing.
4510,It was 5 stars but give me mote wine!!!!!!!!!!!!! Wooootah wooootah the coconut was guuuuud
4511,"Menu tasting was mediocre, the pricing and the taste of the dishes didn't match. Many other spots in NYC thats better than this place."
4512,Honey parfait with caramel jelly amouse bouche. It's been here for 18 years and offers amazing multi course dessert pairings.
4513,"I've wanted to come to this dessert bar for such a long time, and I'm so glad I did. One thing about me is that I prefer larger portions of food, and I really dislike overpaying for food when it's served in tiny portions, so this is where it lost a star for me since the desserts were incredibly small. For the unique environment and taste though, it's understandable. From the service to food, it was all exceptional. The menu is pre-fixe, so you choose desserts and are served additional petit fours. I can't remember the names of the dishes, but I must say, they exceeded my expectations. The tastes were so unique and unlike any other dessert I've tried. Chika and the other chefs worked on each plate with such delicate care, so it was really interesting watching them and how they make their desserts. Just unfortunate that my dish lasted 4-5 bites! Don't think I'll be back for awhile, but I do think it's worth the experience!"
4514,So happy they're still open!!!! Chikalicious has such a special place in my heart! They have some outdoor seating. Swung by a few days ago and got the creme brûlée donuts which weee so yummy! Took some home and heated it up in the oven. I'm dying to come back so I can order the dessert bento. Love how creative they are
4515,"I had just come out of a local tapas restaurant with a friend craving some dessert. We browsed the selection, Van Leuwen, a solid choice, a couple of other places, insomnia cookies crossed my minds. But then I stumbled upon ChikaLicious. We rolled the dice and soon enough we were waiting on a line about 6 people deep. We both questioned each other's motives and intent. Did we actually want to stand here and wait for this? Would we be let down? Would there be a quenelle that couldn't satiate our Ice cream hunger!? Lucky for us we stayed and were treated with dare I say one of the best dessert experiences I've had in a long time. Getting a seat at the dessert bar is by far the way to go. Watching these artists paint their desserts on the blank canvas of plates is in itself worth the $18.00 price tag of admission. Watching chef Edwin plate a quenelle, for it to slightly melt as he prepared everything else then seeing Madame Chika crack a smirk and replate everything, shows the extremely high level of standards she has for her kitchen. Surgical precision. The conversation with total strangers, mingling with the staff, seeing my friend Natalya finally be excited to be out eating this late was just the pièce de résistance. Everything was opulent and served with such attention to detail. Highly recommend this place. Hands down. Come get some dessert and leave amazed and in awe of how a precision dessert bar is run.  Cash and credit accepted, sit at the bar if you can!"
4516,"I got creme brulee donuts and they were hot, fresh, and delicious, at 9pm! Even during COVID they were still up and running this late. Love it, i'd def go back, esp since it's down the road from me !"
4517,"If you're in East Village area and looking for a dessert spot, definitely go here! It's a small spot so there might be a wait, but stay because it's such a cute spot with delicious desserts. We got a price fixed dessert, which comes in three courses and you pick 1/3 of the desserts. Lovely idea."
4518,"Tiny space full of ambiance and yes, it is perfect for a date, but you do sit really close with other people (at the counter seats) so it might vary for each person. When we were ushered to the counter seats, I was pretty excited because silly me thought that wow, I would actually get to see some cooking/baking action!Boy . . . was I wrong. What you get to see is the chef plating the desserts. There's no cooking involved. You watch them take out plates, take out cartons of pre-made filling/dessert, and then scoop it out on a plate. Then they hand said plate to you and explain the components. Well, this is no Japanese cook-my-yakisoba-in-front-of-me-experience haha. Which I totally understand, as rolling dough and baking in front of me would've probably kept me there for two hours!The tasting, for $18, comes with petit fours and you pick an entree. First course was this lime sorbet in a condensed milk. Very refreshing start to the tasting!Second was the entree course, which I picked panna cotta. THIS alone deserves 5 stars. BEST panna cotta I've ever had. It was soooo rich and so freaking creamy. But it is essentially two scoops of panna cotta. While I enjoyed the star of this plate, the two green scoops of basil and lemongrass ""sorbet"" really ruined the the flavors for me. Unnecessary addition to the panna cotta, and I couldn't eat it together as the flavors were too weird together for me. Finally, the remaining petit fours came, and we ended with a bang of sweetness. WAY too sweet. Everything was really soft (especially the marshmallow) and the cookie was super buttery, but these last three things made my teeth cringe. I do think it's a bit on the pricier side for something that wasn't all spectacular, but that panna cotta was pretty heavenly. Would I come back again to try something else? Nah, especially because the petit fours weren't that great"
4519,"Great dessert spot! Really cute too so it would be perfect for date night or an intimate girls night. What I personally appreciated was that the desserts were not sugar creations on plates, they were just sweet enough and allowed other flavors to shine for each dessert. We had the fromage Blanc island cheese cake, coconut marshmallow, and warm chocolate tart. All were delicious but you have to have the cheesecake!"
4520,We went to chikalicious dessert bar and did the dessert tasting for my husband's birthday.We sat at the counter and got to see chef chika preparing the desserts.We had the butternut squash icecream brulee ajd brown sugar pannacotta.Both of them were delicious.The pannacotta had a nice wiggle to it(this is what happens when you watch lot of masterchef on tv).Definitely going back when we want to indulge in some amazing desserts and will be taking all the dessert lover friends visiting us in new york.
4521,"We tried this place out awhile ago. This was from back in February. It was really good and we were able to catch a seat on the weekends. It's pretty pricey, but I would go for friends birthday's or special occasions to try their kitchen out. They make the desserts right in front of you for that open kitchen concept. They have a set menu with the option to choose their your main course from. The pictures below is an appetizer, main course, and dessert. The banana one was really good as well as their seasonal one. Honestly, it was just really good but small portions so don't expect  too much with regards to portion sizes."
4522,"this place is so cute! the perfect place to stop after dinner. the crepe cake is obviously great but the lava cake was AMAZING. you have to get it, goes perfectly with the vanilla ice cream and the lava just melts in your mouth - i just wish it was bigger!"
4523,"This will be the best meal you'll ever experience- and yes, dessert. You will leave this place changed for the better. The spot, a minimal approach to decor making it an ambience where staff, including Chika are there to provide a home like atmosphere. A beautiful wine selection is available and menu offering for a dessert and wine pairing. Staff made you feel that you were welcomed to not their home ensuring appropriate playing and preparation for dessert was in place and attentive through our experience. Chika we love you !"
4524,"I am of the firm opinion that dessert is the best part of the fine dining experience. Chikalicious, a cute omakase-style dessert bar run by Chika (for which the bar is named after) and her husband Don, caters to people like me by offering only the dessert portion of a Michelin Star french/American fine dining course for a very reasonable $25.My favorite thing about Chikalicious is its ambience and that you get to watch professional chefs make such artistically creative desserts. I first learned of this place in 2015, and an experience that still sticks with me to this day is watching one of the dessert chefs peel an orange and chop it into tiny, perfect cubes, and then transfer them into a little tupperware container for mis en place (it is an open kitchen where you watch the chefs prep the food).  There was absolutely zero mess or spill, and the work area was kept so clean. It's almost mesmerizing to watch how so much food can be prepared with zero accumulation of mess.The shop is very cozy and plays a groovy playlist, and my sister and I were lucky enough to get a counter seat at 9pm on a Saturday evening. I ordered the Grapefruit Brulee, which to my surprise was not really a firm egg custard but more like a sabayon draped over the grapefruit, with the top torched for 5-10 seconds. Nevertheless, it worked well and was a very refreshing dessert, with a good mouthfeel from the warm creamy sabayon, the acidy squishiness of the grapefruit, and the smooth, cold grapefruit sorbet on top. This was preceded with an amuse bouche of a bourbon-molasses ice cream on a fruit jam, and was followed up with a petit fours of various sweets. Totally worth it, and I will make sure to come back again next time I'm in NYC."
4525,"Ventured here spontaneously when a dessert-craving hit, following a dinner nearby. My boyfriend and I were blown away by the dessert and wine pairing. We ordered the Creme Brûlée Doughnut and Mille Crepe Cake. Both were very flavorful, and light too, so we didn't walk away induced in a food / sugar coma . The wines complemented and elevated the desserts. Very well thought out. I found myself smiling wider with each bite. We will definitely be back!"
4526,"One of my absolute favorite finds since I moved to NYC. Chika and her team have created such an warm, inviting and intimate space for themselves to just create and share their incredible, delectable confections. The concept is a simple, but enticing one... select one (or more) of the seasonal dessert offerings and then sit back as you are treated to a 3-course dessert tasting menu which includes an amuse bouche, your selected ""entree"", and a round of petit fours to finish. The menu mostly changes with the seasons, but everything is made fresh and Chika's flavors and meticulous attention to detail are unrivaled. If you can, snag seats at the bar so you can watch the master at work. One mainstay on the menu is the crustless cheesecake, which is unwrapped from its cloth immediately prior to serving and is presented on a tray of crushed ice. Light as a cloud, and with just the correct amount of sweetness - this is a cheesecake to convert even the most staunch of cheesecake haters (which is exactly what happened when my cheesecake-abhorrent friend ended eating like half of mine!). Pro tip: Go early (i.e., prior to the post-dinner rush), as the space is small and the line forms quickly!"
4527,"3.5/5Love the concept. But it's too expensive. I think it's fun to try once or visit for a special occasion (if you have time). It's not a regular place where you quickly grab dessert and leave. It's a whole experience. I had no idea what to expect when I came here. I was a little confused by what was going on when I first walked in. It's a 3 course dessert menu. We ordered the cheesecake fromage. It came with lychee sorbet (my fav of the night) and petite fours. I can see the dedication to the presentation and respect the time put into the art. However, I just don't think that the desserts were up to par in terms of taste. With the steep price of $20 per set, I could have eaten a 2nd dinner! The cheesecake fromage was placed on top of a bowl of ice. I mean I get that this place is about presentation... but ... I feel like the ice was a waste of time and doesn't really add much to the presentation nor taste of the dish. Unsure about how I feel about coming back. Some of the other things looked interesting though. I also believe there are seasonal things. Maybe I would have enjoyed another plate more."
4528,"Small Michelin star desert place with a menu that changes daily. Chika, the chef, is the star of the show and she makes all of the dishes. Both counter and booth seating. The counter seating is by far better however as you can see Chika in action. The majority of the seating is first come, first serve. They also have reserved seating a couple of times throughout the day, but you can't be more than 5 min late or else you lose your spot. You order one dessert off the menu, and it comes with a couple other sweet treats for 18$. Also have a few drink options. The desserts are delicious, but tiny. They are beautiful tough and are more like art than food. Great service as well.7.75/10"
4529,Went there with a friend to celebrate the 2020 election. There was indoor and outdoor seating. We were lucky enough to beat the line and grab a table outside. DoughYAKI was light and fluffy. I had a port to go with my dessert as well. Definitely like the French inspired japanese dessert. Definitely on my list of places to go when my sweet tooth kicks in and Im in the area.
4530,"I have to say that my finds in the city keep getting better and better-thanks to Yelp! I went out to dinner at Ikinari (again) and decided to venture further for some awesome desserts. My friends and I walked to ChikaLicious only to realize there were TWO locations right across the street from each other! Not really knowing which one to go to, we split up and waited in line for both to scope out the place.The one that I waited in line for was the LEGIT dessert bar where it looked like it offered a pre-fixe menu-pretty much FINE dessert dining. It's a tiny place with a bar that sits about 10 on the right hand side and that's pretty much it. The chefs prepare the desserts in front of you and you wait until people leave to get seated.On the opposite side was the more 'on the go' type of dessert..which is what we opted to do. This was where we wanted ice cream on those churros cones! Again, a VERY tiny place with a small little booth to side on the right hand side (maybe about 6 people), this location offers ice cream of different flavors on churros cones (already f*king amazing). There's other desserts like their cheesecake or doughnut/croissants, but I'm pretty sure people come here for the ice cream.Anyway, the line goes by pretty quick but because it's a small place, the amount of people waiting in that place is awful. The desserts doesn't come out right away and people end up crammed up at the front waiting because people don't know how to move outta the way to let others order. Names are taken for the order so waiting outside for your order isn't the worst thing in the world. I ordered the black sesame ice cream (you can get the churro cone with or without cinnamon) and my husband ordered the s'mores flavor (pictures to follow). Black sesame is probably one of my favorite ice cream flavors other than mint chocolate chip and this place makes mouth watering black sesame ice cream. Drizzled with white chocolate and little cookie flakes on top, the flavors combined gives you a crazy party in your mouth. My husband's s'mores ice cream was a bit messy since it comes with a graham cracker and a melted marshmallow on top...from that and the warm churro cone, the ice cream melted a lot faster than others...so if you're ordering this flavor, be sure to have a lot of napkins and hand sanitizer with you cuz it WILL get deliciously messy! I LOVE finding these hole in the wall places because they offer the BEST of the best. I gave this place a four star only because the person at the register kept taking orders while everyone was crammed at the front waiting for their orders -it seems like they could've told everyone who already ordered, they should've waited outside to clear the line to order. Regardless she was so friendly and nice and no matter how busy they were, she always had a smile on her face! I would totally come back to try the other flavors. If it's this popular during a cold, windy, 'spring' night, I can't even imagine how it is during the summer!"
4531,"I love the vibe of ChikaLicious. It's really brightly lit and the layout of the small space is clean, crisp and simple. It almost seems European to me? The dessert was wonderful. I absolutely loved the unique combination of flavours and presentation of the dessert and think it's well worth a visit to this hyped up dessert shop. As far as the menu goes, you get a prix fixe set for $18, which comes with a dessert of your choosing and petit fours (four small desserts). Everything on the menu changes seasonally, and I believe the petit fours changes more often than that. My prix fixe set started with one of the petit fours - it was a coconut ice cream with burnt pepper jelly and other stuff. It was soooo good...seriously so genius to mix the creaminess of the coconut ice cream with the pepper! I ordered an earl grey panna cotta as my main dessert, and my friend ordered a chocolate tart. I tried some of the chocolate tart, and it was very good, but it didn't change my life. The panna cotta, on the other hand, changed my life. The texture was so smooth, and the flavor was so rich! I almost wanted to order seconds right then and there! The ""meal"" ended with the last 3 petit fours, which were small, tasty, but not the highlight of my experience. I thought it was well worth $18. Yes, it's pricy for the portions you're getting, but the presentation, genius of Chika, and overall experience is well worth it. Definitely a good treat yoself dessert. The staff was all around so friendly. It was awesome to see Chika up close working her magic! She may also be the cutest/sweetest person ever. The wait can get long here, but the staff gave reasonable time estimates. I will be back for sure! TRY THE EARLY GREY PANNA COTTA."
4532,"this place was always on my list because japanese-style desserts have a special place in my heart. needless to say, this place really impressed me!when i visited over the summer, there were around 3 tables set up for outdoor seating. you could place your order near the entrance, and i paid with card; i'm unsure if they accept cash? they now also have an online system where you can order ahead through their website. you can also get takeout or delivery through grubhub, i believe. miss chika, the lady who makes all of these desserts, definitely puts her heart and soul into every single thing on the menu! their cake slices also slightly remind me of the japanese cakes from harbs, which is also similar in terms of price and quality. 6/27/20-doughyaki: this is probably one of their most famous dessert options. the bad news is that this is my least favorite one out of the three things i bought. the good news is that it still tasted pretty good. it's essentially a doughnut with a very thin layer of creme brulee on top. i loved how unique this creation was! the outside was slightly crispy and the chewy inside had a warm custard filling. it wasn't too sweet either, which my mom enjoyed. this fell short with me in terms of price. it was $7 without tax, which i think was overly expensive. the doughnut was extremely small, and i didn't think it was worth the cost. i definitely would've rated this higher if it was a bit cheaper. (3.5/5)-mille crepe cake slice with tahitian vanilla cream: oh my god this left me speechless! my mom and i couldn't stop eating this, even though we said we'd only take a few bites each. this cake was perfect in every way possible. the vanilla cream was subtly sweet and the crepe layers were so delicate. each bite had the perfect texture and i seriously don't think i've had a better crepe cake in my life before. i probably wouldn't get this again, though. one slice costs around $11 without tax, and the portion is generally pretty small. (4.5/5)-strawberry shortcake slice: i love japanese strawberry shortcakes, and this did not disappoint me! the strawberry cream tasted fresh and the layers of shortcake were so soft and bouncy. the cream on the outside was probably the sweetest part of the cake, but it was absolutely delicious. this slice also costed $11; it was just a bit bigger in size than the crepe cake slice, since the layers had more volume to them. i also probably wouldn't buy this again since it's so expensive, but i was so glad that i got to try it. (4.5/5)overall, there's a reason why my mom and i were able to devour all three of these desserts within the span of a 10 minute car ride. i would give this place 4.5 stars, but this visit drained my wallet. otherwise, i would've rated it 5 stars no question. this place is truly a gem and i was really happy with my experience here. i can definitely see myself coming back, and i hope to try out their prix fixe 3 course tasting menu one day!"
4533,"I've been here for quite a few times. Every time my friend came to visit NY, I always bring them here. Three course dessert is an incredible experience here. One thing I like the most is that dessert here is not too sweet. It's a Japanese establishment and its Japanese approach of dessert makes it very refreshing and comforting. The menu is different every time I come here and nothing has disappointed me yet. The chef is really detail-oriented and devotes a lot of time on everything. From the decoration of the restaurant to the plates, everything is perfect. Quick tip, wait in front of the restaurant before it opens. If you come here after it opens, it'll be very hard to get a table. Also the prices are not bad at all. The whole experience is worth every penny. I highly recommend this place and it's truly a gem in NYC for dessert."
4534,"My boyfriend reserved a seat for a date night about two weeks in advance and it was so worth it. You get to watch as Chika works her magic up close right at the bar and service is friendly and quick! Ambience was fun and lighthearted even if it wasn't the most intimate setting for a date (worth it to watch our desserts being made right before our eyes).  We started with a sorbet over a ginger creme (that I didn't get to photograph) and it was the perfect balance between creamy and sweet with a light icy tartness.Then I got the orange pound cake which equally danced between a tangy sorbet and a fluffy cake and sweet creme. My boyfriend ordered the grapefruit creme brûlée which was refreshingly fruity.The petite fours were a coconut marshmallow that was very light unlike most heavy, thick gelatinous marshmallows; a pound cake with a walnut for crunch; and a rich cocoa creme cookie. All of which were not overly sweet and played with various textures.I ordered an espresso in case it was too much sugar and too much sweet (they even let me pick out which tea cup I wanted!) - a good perk but not necessary since the sugar is not overwhelming as a three course dessert bar might threaten. Chika works with creams, sorbets, cakes, and chocolate by making each difference stand out through their contrasts from one another. Wonderful experience and will go again for another date night."
4535,"My favorite dessert spot in all of Manhattan! The desserts are to DIE for, and Chika and her staff are truly lovely and talented people. I love this place so much that I would pay a lot of money for Chika to make my wedding cake one day!! Perhaps the strawberry cream cake :-)"
4536,"I love this place! Chika- the owner also the chef, prepared passionately almost every dessert for the guests! I found many other places make  very sweet dessert (i guess ppl in NYC prefer sweeter dessert) . And here the taste is just perfect, well balanced.I ordered 2 desserts: cheesecake & white chocolate mousse ( the one in the pic).. So yummyyyyy!!!Its 18$/dessert plus free petits four ( 4mini  desserts). Its a bit pricey for having just dessert: but from what chikalicious gave me: the delicious dessert, the passion from the owner to the staff, the warm & friendly ambiance , it totally worth the price!!!I would love to recommend this place to all my friends and u as well! Come and see if im telling you the truth ;)"
4537,"Disappointing. I've been wanting to try here and I decided to give them a try. This place is overpriced I think and everything was so small. I was expecting their dessert is delicious but everything was just okay. Nothing special. Meh.. I wouldn't complain if they had really good dessert even if their price is high and the portion is small. I wouldn't come back here again. If you are curious about this place, you could try but I don't recommend."
4538,"Cute spot, friendly service! The signature doughyaki is a very unique product and I can recommend you to try! Anyways, it's probably not a spot going every day because of the price."
4539,Always love this dessert joint! Cute small place with great service and delicious desserts.
4540,"Better than the location in Midtown. Like it better than Raku so I'm an outlier.I was debating to give it a 4 stars cause the host tried to seat us at the bar saying it's a half hour wait but then sat us in 10. (But I forgave due to the food and service.)They've cut down on their menu since I first tried their food 3 years ago. My go-to's are Spicy TanTan udon and salmon carpaccio. Instead of the carpaccio, they have the seared salmon which tasted delicious too. They don't let you choose noodle type and bowl size anymore but it doesn't matter to me since I always go with the default options.Not something to eat everyday but great once in awhile."
4541,"Honestly, the udon was a let-down. I got the truffle snow crab udon, and while it was tasty, the actual udon noodles were disappointing. They felt like they were overcooked. They were really soft and didn't have that chewiness and bounce that made great udon noodles great. If you can't get the udon noodles right at an udon house, something is wrong. I also ordered a tuna roll, which was surprisingly delicious. The fish tasted really fresh. I enjoyed the roll more than the udon. Overall, I would give 3.5 stars if I could."
4542,"I have mixed feelings about this place. Maybe my hopes were too high from the rave reviews? This place was on my list and I've heard great things. I will say, it's a great deal for the sushi set combos. The combos come with a small udon, a roll, and sushi. Everything can also be upgraded. I opted for the deluxe sushi, the shrimp and crab roll, and uni udon. I felt the sushi was subpar and could have been a little more fresh. I was super excited for the uni udon. However, it was difficult to get through. I knew it was a cream udon, but it ended up being overwhelmingly creamy and salty. It felt wasteful given it was an upgraded item. When it came time to pay, we noticed an extra charge for one of the combos. When we brought it to our waitress' attention, she didn't really give us a reason why which we thought was kind of strange. Overall, the food is decent. If you're looking for a good value meal, this could be an option."
4543,"My friend and I came here for Feb 2022 NY Restaurant Week. We got the Deluxe Restaurant Week Omakase, which included 9 sushi and small soy dashi udon. It was really filling, but I didn't think that the sushi tasted that fresh. But you get what you pay for. Service was great, but also if you are a small party (mine was a party of 2), you might get seated in the middle where you will not be facing each other, but be facing a glass/plastic divider where you'll be able to see the people across from you. Not sure how we felt about that. But overall ok experience."
4544,"I used to frequent the Midtown location whenever I could get out of the office for lunch, but never got around to writing a review (oops!). Caught up with a few girlfriends at the Union Sq location recently, and I have to say, the OG branch is much nicer.Pros: - Affordable sushi & udon combos, especially during Restaurant Week, that will net you 8 pieces of ngiri + 3 pieces of sashimi + one 6-piece roll + a bowl of udon soup for $28. - Lovely, modern decor with ample, spacious seatingCons:- Service with an attitude. The bartender couldn't have been any more stuck-up when we asked him where the host was--since there was no one manning the stand. The host himself was also rude and stuck-up.- Flavorless salmon sashimi/ngiri that made me wonder how long it had been chilling on ice or soaking in water to be THAT bland.All in all, an okay spot if you're in the area, craving soup and on a budget. I don't know if I'll ever make it back to either Manhattan location again, but I'm not too sad about it."
4545,"My partner and I were in the vicinity recently and stopped here with my partner during restaurant week. It's a younger vibe here with music to match.  It was around 2pm on the weekend and the lunch crowd was thinning, so we were able to get a booth seat.  We started off with some water and a bottle of dassai 45, which was huge, around 750 ml, and took a while to finish off. We each ordered the restaurant week omakase set, mine was the premium and she had the deluxe because she's not a big fan of uni.  The premium also came with whole scallop sushi that was able to be split.  Both sets also came with a tuna roll and a bowl of udon, on which we added sliced wagyu ($5 extra). The cuts of fish were well portioned and each type was fresh and savory.  Our favorites were the bluefin toro, which was delicate like butter, and the salmon, which had sufficient fat and texture.  Also, there was also plenty of wasabi and ginger! Overall, the quality of the food is above par.  We peeked at the regular menu and the prices are respectable.  Additionally, the selection of wines, sakes and beers is not extensive, but good enough and makes your decision less complicated.  We definitely would return!"
4546,"Stopped in with a friend for Restaurant Week 2022, so we ordered off of a pre-fix menu that isn't available the entire time. Here the RW menu included different levels of a sushi omakase platters and a small udon bowl that you could pick. On top of the pre-fix menu, we also ordered a shrimp and vegetable tempura app. Everything was fried to perfection. I loved all of the fun veggies that I've never had tempered before. Very traditional, it came with a sauce but it also came with fresh grated radish.The sushi was so incredible! Very fresh, amazing fish. We went with the middle tier, so lots of tuna, some salmon, other white fish and some fun extras like salmon eggs and eel. It also came with a tuna roll. For the udon, I went with the US Wagyu option. Sliced wagyu pieces and truffle oil. It was delicious! With all the sushi the small bowl was a perfect addition to the meal. My friend got the Katsu curry, she loved it, thought it wasn't too spicy and ate the entire thing. If your looking for a drink to have the lychee martinis ($9 all night!) we're very tasty, just a bit sweet. They are made to order so we asked for a little less pulp, if your not a pulp fan in drinks I would keep this in mind. Can't wait to come back and try more from the menu!"
4547,"I got the Shishito Pepper as an appetizer and got Uni Crème Udon as the entrée. Shishito Pepper as an appetizer was a good choice and it was delicious. The Uni Crème Udon was not really what I expected. As you can see from the photo, the ingredients like shiso leaf, tobiko caviar and uni is not enough to represent the dish. The price for this was $24 and the value wasn't there. However, the flavor was good so I gave 3 stars. I fell in love with Tsurutontan in Tokyo, but I'm Afraid that the food quality did not translate the same in NYC."
4548,"Gosh I love this place. I have been here so many times!! I have recommended this restaurant to so many people. If you feel like having a delicious bowl of udon - with curry, with cream sauce, with broth, this is the place to be. So far I have tried:Wagyu Truffle Dashi - wagyu beef in the most savory truffle dashi. It is simple, comfort food and smells so good. I love this oneWagyu Sukiyaki Deluxe - this comes in sweet soy broth with lots of wagyu, veggies, shimeji, maitake, shitake mushrooms, and a poached egg. It is delicious and filling. I recommend this if you're hungry.Crab, Roe, Uni Donburi - expensive, but worth it if you are an uni lover.There are more but I wrote this review like 3 years after I started going so I can't remember them all. Henceforth, I will be updating as I try more udons.Please enjoy!Also, although there is usually a line out the door, it is a pretty spacious place so it's not too bad of a wait. At least not the last couple times I went."
4549,"Wanted to try this place for a while and finally did it!Came for a weekday lunch and surprised by the good ambiance and decoration of the restaurant. So pretty and chill!Went for the wagyu deluxe sukiyaki.At first, I was so surprised by the size of the bowl lol, HUGE. Same with the spoon that came with it hahaAbout the soup, happy that it actually came with lots of veggies, udon was really good and beef tender.4 stars because the soup was way too sweet for my taste. So, although i had an overall good meal because of the ingredients, the soup was too much.Service quick and very accomodating with my stroller!"
4550,"The service was pretty good for how busy it was and the food was great for the price. There were some things that were a bit off that takes away from a perfect five stars. My party and I had a reservation so there was no wait time for a table. When we were seated, though, We waited a pretty long time to get our water glasses and silverware and to order. The salmon lover set is a great deal and the salmon nigiri was fantastic. The rolls were not my favorite, especially the one with crab in it. It tasted like chapstick. Of the three of us that ordered the salmon deluxe, one liked that roll. The spicy udon could have had more flavor and meat but the sukiyaki beef udon was delicious. Great amount of meat and good flavors. The sizzling sukiyaki was the best. Such good flavors and a huge portion. The meat was a bit fatty but overall it's a dish that you can't go wrong ordering. The fries were standard, the Mayo they come with is really good and usually I'm really not a fan of Mayo. Would come back! Getting different items though"
4551,"Legit one of my favorite spots to eat in the city. This place is not a cute mom and pop shop where the owner hand makes the noodles and broth and serves only one type of dish on the menu. Just the opposite. Tsurutonton is like this vast, well oiled machine that can seat you pretty quickly and give you a menu that can pretty much satisfy someone who wants to keep it light or go really heavy. You can't really go wrong with the menu.If you feel like something light and refreshing:- The cold uni is a perfect summer dish. You get this really nice clean broth and briny uni that you can have alongside chilled udon. This is one of my favorite dishes here.If you want something heavy:- The Wagyu Beef Truffle Dashi and the Wagyu Deluxe Sukiyaki are bold and packed with beefy flavor. If you need to fortify your strength for a long day of walking around the city, this will do it. Or put you back into a couch for a long nap.- If you just want creamy broth, the Truffle Crab Cream, the Uni Creme, and the Mentaiko Cream dishes are what you need to have. It's a lot though, if you plan on drinking all that rich broth. Don't underestimate it!Donburi:- A rice dish at an udon place. But... you get udon on the side. The Uni Ikura Crab is a hidden gem on this menu. It's a lot of food but damn, if this isn't one of the best dishes here...."
4552,"Delicious, flavorful, you're in for a slurpy time. It might've been the second time I got Dan Dan noodles that week but I made it and it was delicious and worth it."
4553,"Prices fair for the area. Food and service were sub-par and fell under expectations. I've ordered delivery before and don't remember it being that bad. Weren't greeted very warmly, felt like the servers were trying to get us in and out as fast as possible, which I don't usually get even in fuller restaurants. It was pretty empty as it was between lunch and dinner. @ Spicy tantan udon (part of omakase set)- pretty disgusting. Expected udon to be okay, but noodles were overcooked to near mush (similar to previous delivery order although I thought it was the delivery time ruining the udon). Noodles (not the soul surprisingly) had an odd bitter flavor as primary. Spicy, but not too appetizing. Okay if you haven't had udon before I guess.@ Omakase dinner set (basic) - came with eight pieces nigiri, one tuna roll, and small size udon. Overall quality is average, doesn't live up to omakase expectation. The seaweed was soggy and chewy, weird it wasn't roasted. The sushi pieces were messy as shown. Worse yet, I found multiple scales in the pieces, something I really can't stand. It shows how speed and mass production is grossly prioritized over the food quality and presentation. @ Grilled mushrooms - very yummy. Wonderful grilled flavor with truffle oil and crispy batter pieces. Nice chunks of mushroom in a flavorful appetizer. Someone messed up on both the udon and the sushi we got or I'd have to conclude that the food quality is just as we experienced, under average relative to the prices and quality in the area. tl;dr grilled mushrooms had good truffle and grill favor, try your luck at the udon and sushi but be wary of being disappointed. Quick service with hawk eyes, huge seating areas."
4554,"Please take this review with a grain of salt - it was weekday dinner and we got our order in with the literal last order. Staff were probably busy with closing - Food (5/5) but price (2/5)- came here for dinner and the menu was super confusing; happy hour pricing supposedly goes til midnight and would have paid 20 for my meal but wound up spending up to 30?Got the sukiyaki udon, the portions are gigantic. Soup was just the right amount of sweet, and the scallions were a nice touch. Egg was perfectly poached, ramen noodles were not too overdone (and the soup was still clear!) and the right thickness.Ambiance (3/5) - well decorated and super cozy! Not too crowded though very efficient use of the space - but the place is not well insulated; the door kept getting propped open and for a nyc winter night this was not ideal.Service (3/5) - slow, and a lot of simple things were overlooked, like we didn't get one of our ladles with our noodles and chopsticks with the other.Despite all this I would definitely come again especially for the happy hour menu; want to try a lot of the ramen / noodle choices!"
4555,"First of all, I love the ambiance and setup of this location. It's modern and great for a date night or gathering with friends and family. Making reservations online was easy. They do have outdoor seating but it's right on the sidewalk uncovered with no heat. It's pretty clear that they did not put too much effort on that part.I came for the Wagyu Beef Truffle Dashi Udon which I first had in their midtown location years ago and still dream about. I remember it being heavenly and rich. Unfortunately, this time it seemed a bit more diluted which was disappointing. Next time I think I will try something else.We also ordered the Soy Garlic Fried Chicken to share. If you are expecting it to be Korean-style, it is most definitely not. It just tasted like karage with soy sauce to me. I wouldn't recommend it."
4556,"Modern decor, comfortable seating, attentive staff, excellent foodAlways a great stop for amazing udonThe cucumber salad is nice and fresh with a splash of sesame oilThe tuna cones are good, not the most amazing take on raw tuna in a crispy shell, but something I always order anywaysWe ordered the creamy spicy shrimp tempura for the first time - delicious, delicious sauce on top of a well fried shrimp with tempura style batter - the shrimp is not the typical elongated jumbo shrimpUdon is delicious, many options to choose from whether you want savory, sweet, or creamyThe Uni Crème is a favorite of mine, but it's not for everyone - extremely creamy broth, surprisingly not too fishy with the roe and Uni."
4557,"Perhaps it was the company. But their tuna cones are superb, fun to eat and delish. My udon was gigantic and not lacking in meat broth richness while his uni ikura crab bowl is nothing short of amazing- but how could anything w that trinity be short of stellar? Drinks were strong and perfect for the occasion. Atmosphere was intimate & service decent. Definite revisit."
4558,"I checked out this spot as I was craving hot udon noodles to combat the cold and snow in NYC this weekend. I tried the deluxe restaurant week omakase with beef udon noodles and it was amazing. The sushi tasted incredibly fresh and the udon noodles were rich and savory, not watery like I've had at other places. The price point is hard to beat - $29 only due to restaurant week, check them and other participating restaurants this NYC Restaurant Week!"
4559,Super consistent food all the time and if you're craving some udon noodles this is a great restaurant. The happy hour prices aren't THAT much of a difference and we got seated pretty much instantly on a Sunday afternoon.My go to order is the katsu curry udon. The portions are kind of big so usually I can't finish it all. But overall great food!!!!
4560,"If you're looking for a restaurant with a killer lunch menu and happy hour, this is the place!I ordered the 2 roll special. It came with a full bowl of udon and two sushi rolls. My order was the cold udon, avocado roll and mentaiko egg roll. Since it was happy hour, I decided to also order crispy corn tempura. Their select appetizers were half price! All of this came out to $25 plus tip! What a steal, right?!?!The food was absolutely incredible! The broth for the udon wasn't too salty. I learned I wasn't a fan of cold broth. It wasn't the restaurant's fault - it was more so my preference. The crispy corn tempura was amazing! It was extremely crispy. The sauce tasted delicious. I'm not too sure what it was, though. Both of the rolls were nothing fancy but still enjoyable!The service was a little slow, but I have no complaints. Just be aware when you come in :)"
4561,"Sushi very good.As was the noodles.Also drank some sake.Everyone else couldn't finish their food, so I finished their food.I ate too much.Recommend this restaurant.No further comments."
4562,"Came here for a late lunch as I was in the area. The menu undergone some changes and have new items. It was empty when I arrived with a few customers there. Always clean and havr great mellow vibe.Ordered kurobuta sausages (4 small grilled sausages) + large bowl of spicy tan tan udon. Udons are always made fresh, chewy/QQ and thick. Yum. I enjoyed the sausages alot and glad I chose it over the grilled maritake mushroom (I'll get the mushrooms next time)."
4563,"How hard is it to get a delivery order correct that's just one order of noodles. Careless. You're a restaurant in the business of food. Get it right, at the very least. I ordered sukiyaki but got a beef udon instead. Would've been alright if it tasted okay. The beef is flavorless and tough and basically all fat. No vegetables. I sprinkled on a bit of spring onion and cilantro I had in my fridge. Udon noodles were not fresh, maybe cause I placed my order right before they closed. The experience eating at the restaurant I remember was a decent one, so thought I'd try ordering in. But eh."
4564,"We visited for dinner as a party of 3, for restaurant week. I ordered the middle item ($29) with sukiyaki udon.The udon (small size) broth was warm, hearty, and sweet. I would come back for this on a cold day, although it did feel a bit too sweet towards the end. It did cost $3 extra to ""upgrade"" my udon to sukiyaki udon.The sushi was disappointing. Fish wasn't very flavorful, but more so than that the rice felt over-seasoned to the point of overwhelming the already mild fish, and I felt that each sushi had way too much rice compared to the fish.At the end, I did spend around $40 including tax and tip, and I felt that it was kind of a fair price, but definitely not a bargain considering the quality of food."
4565,"Been really wanting to try out this place and finally had a chance to have a quick dinner date in the car. Yes in the car ! Being constraint with time and difficulty finding parking, we ended up order an Uber eats delivery to the car. Aside from that, they had many generous take out and delivery specials including buy one get one and up to 50% off select items. We ended ordering sukiyaki beef udon noodle soup and a mini spicy tuna rice bowl. The sukiyaki beef broth was so delicious ; however, as we continued eating we felt that it was getting saltier and saltier. The mini spicy tuna bowl was disappointing tho. Perhaps the tuna got cooked when it was confined in a take out container, but it was bland with very little tuna and a lot of rice. Overall, I need to make a trip to dine in the restaurant and experience the hot bowl of udon by itself."
4566,"Very well priced. We went here for New york restaurant week and they had 3 omakase options - Standard $29, Deluxe $34, Premium $39. I got the premium one which came with udon of choice which for me was Katsu Curry. I enjoy them both separately but together it felt like a lot of food. I meant I can't complain. The bill was so reasonable for this quality of food. The service was quick too."
4567,"This is a review of my experience here pre-pandemic.I always felt like this place was pricey so I never really was interested, until my coworkers mentioned to me one day that the bowls and spoons were bigger than your head. Well, that certainly got my attention. I love places that have cool selling points like that, lol. About 8 of us came here for lunch on a cold, windy day, and I'd have to say that the lunch menu was really reasonable! The inside of the restaurant felt spacious and a bit upscale to me. I ended up ordering a mini sukiyaki don combo (which came with a full size udon). I chose the spicy tan tan udon with my sukiyaki don. Both were flavorful and exceeded my expectations. The menu is pretty extensive consisting of udons, sushi and donburi, etc.  Ended up having to take my leftovers to go because, well just look at the size of that...One thing to note is that while they do let you take your leftovers to go, they did not allow me to order an extra udon for take out (for my coworker), and said that if I wanted to take out I'd have to order through Seamless. Felt pointless to be honest, since I was already there and could pick it up. But besides that little hiccup, my experience here was overall satisfactory!"
4568,"Love this place before covid, during, and after!Quality is always amazing and quantity as well.Great for dates and good price for family as well because of the size of the dishes.Their curry udon is amazing and sushi is also amazing too. I always have a great time!Service is always amazing too. One of my go to places that can never go wrong in Union square that doesn't break the bank but still fun and yummy!"
4569,Udon noodles were overcooked. Broth was good. Sushi rice was above average (surprising).Cold noodle was the only one that had decent noodle consistency. I'm a noodle lover. Won't go back.
4570,"Amazing little restaurant on the LES filled with warmth and cheese. Even during these unprecedented times, Raclette has managed to maintain outdoor dining with an isolated greenhouse and heater set up. They have so many options to choose from but the filet with peppercorn cheese on top was amazing along with the Mornay Mac and cheese. The tuna tartare was fresh and accompanied by perfectly seared scallops. Definitely stop by if you are in the area."
4571,Came here with my friends using a Pulsd deal for brunch! We all got the lobster Benedict with some aperol spritz to wash it down - so delicious! I was stuffed and my belly was happy. Great service with cute outdoor dining.
4572,"For cheese lover! This place is more like friend hangout place, very friendly. All the foods are great, you can add cheese to any dish. We tried the traditional and black truffle one, black truffle was great, light flavor to balance out cheese."
4573,"Went here on a self led food tour of NY. Ordered the   Filet with the black truffle cheese. I had really high expectations for this restaurant as a cheese lover, but was sadly disappointed. The steak was cooked well, but the cheese itself was not good. It is lukewarm and was rather bland. The restaurant ambiance was great, but the cheese experience that I went for wasn't worth it in my opinion."
4574,This place is amazing great experience excellent food wonderful staff I would always come here ever and any time I am in the city Please share and try this great place
4575,"If you are thinking about coming here let me be the first to tell you to DO IT!!! You will definitely need a reservation. We had one for 2:15 on a Saturday and all of the tables were filled and I mean all of them. The meals take a bit to make and take quite a while to enjoy BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH FOOD so as you can imagine those without reservations were turned away. We were there for about an hour and half and no table was empty longer than about 5 minutes. The tables are pretty spaced out and the portable heaters are very warm! We actually switched seats as soon as one table opened up because our original seat was too warm, a heater above us and next to us as well. The servers wore gloves and changed them frequently, like after dealing with each table I think. They also throughly wiped down tables between customers. My husband ordered the Raclette Suisse which came with  pickles, potatoes, arugula, pearled onions and viande séchée wit the traditional house raclette cheese I ordered the raclette burger  with the truffle raclette which was super creamy and earthy. I was actually only able to eat about half of the burger there and took the rest to go along with a blackberry thyme cheesecake. The blackberry cheesecake was basic but the lemon sauce or whatever really took it over the edge!We each had a glass of Gewurtztraminer which I highly recommend, the notes really paired well with our dishes.An additional scrape of cheese to finish off your plate is available for a small cost."
4576,"Very solid spot to find some traditional Swiss dishes.  Warning, if you don't eat cheese, this place is probably not for you. It is a restaurant that really celebrates cheese. We shared a few raclettes and enjoyed them even if they are not the most flavorful dishes ever. The baked Camembert was outstanding, definitely get that as a starter for the table. Service and staff were both very pleasant."
4577,"Best! Place! Ever! I was stressing over where to take the beaux for their birthday and decided on Raclette. I called ahead to inform them it was his birthdays And they were so so soo kind. Service was above and beyond (I wish I remembered their names but it was a tall French gentleman and a lovely young lady) and of course the food was DELICIOUS. We got the tomato/mozzarella tartine and the ribeye for 2. Trust me, you will not regret it!!!!!"
4578,"This was the best meal of my entire life. No joke. We got the bone-in ribeye for two. It was 40 ounces, cooked to perfection, and SO FLAVORFUL! Even before the cheese, there was caramelized onions on it, roasted fresh garlic, and rosemary! Then, the flavors got even better with the truffle raclette on top, which everyone needs to try. The steak was served with a yummy bernaise sauce. The steak came with a plate of veggies-fried potatoes, asparagus, portobello mushrooms, and a salad. We got traditional raclette on the veggies and they were also too die for. I was very pleased with the quality of the food, the portions, and the price. It was $78 before tax and tip for this incredible meal. I can't wait to go back again! We also sat outside and it was really nice and they had pretty lights. The staff was helpful and attentive. Do yourself a favor and go here!! Thank you, Raclette! I can't wait to share this on my Instagram food blog."
4579,"I've been wanting to go to this place for years, at least since 2017.  Somehow the opportunity didn't present itself until now.  The food didn't disappoint. I had the Burrata Caprese, a cheese so soft it looked like a little pillow of cheese on top of tomato and balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  Delicious.  Then I had the Raclette New York, which is a filet done to your liking, asparagus, and potatoes.  They ask you what kind of cheese you want  wait what?  Yes!  There's a whole list!  I chose the garlic and it was amazing!!  I will definitely go back!  I went alone this time, next time I'll bring someone along."
4580,Do not order delivery. We placed an order at 5pm via seamless...it's currently 7.15 and nothing. Called and told they have no drivers but it's 'ready'. Asked when it will arrive and told they can't tell us. Thanks for ruining Saturday evening.
4581,"This place was disappointing because I was really looking forward to visiting. The meat was a little dry and they were cheap with the cheese. The sides were mediocre. However, the sandwich was delicious. Taking a bite into it was like biting into heaven. I would go back but only for the sandwich."
4582,Huge disappointment  i order the new york raclette which is a filet mignon and it came out over cooked .. i tried because i thought it was going to be good ... NOPE  extremely dry .. i work in the service industry and this review is mostly not to complaint but to tell my experience .. service was amazing but the food not so good .. i will try it one more time  .. for a meat cut like that as a chef i would check that more that one time ...
4583,This is a must visit if you are visiting the NYC area! Amazing experience and out of this world flavor! Get anything with the melted cheese! You will NOT be disappointed!!!Black Truffle Flavor to die for!!!
4584,"brunch spot with classy atmosphere. the service was quick and staff was kind. indoor and outdoor seating. I ordered the lobster benedict and the lobster was overcooked, but the eggs florentine was great."
4585,Absolutely delicious! I always make it a point to bring guests here when they visit NYC. The Raclette New York meal never disappoints and is enough to feed two! I tried the tomato tartine for the first time last night and it will also be working it's way into my rotation in the future. The outdoor dining area is absolutely adorable -- feels like a Parisian escape!
4586,"This place is it. From the host to our server to our meal, to even the bussers. Everybody and everything about this restaurant was just perfect. The Raclette NY was cooked perfectly. The tuna tartare was one of the best tuna dishes I've ever had. The truffle cheese was unbelievable. The Raclette suisse was so original and delicious. The wine selection was 10/10. The ambiance was so perfect - cute and cozy spot with perfect decor. The service was just the best part though. I will never forget this night and recommend this place highly to anybody. Julia was our sever and she was amazing. She made our anniversary dinner better than we could've dreamt."
4587,"Prepare your belly before coming here. Each bite will make your taste buds dance and you'll be thinking about when's the next time you'll be back here.Service: (5/5) The waiters were very helpful and attentive. At one point they saw us trying to shoo away a bee, and they came over to help us out. The decor is very nice and green if you're able to get seating under the big tent. Otherwise, dining here is still great as they have dividers set up in between tables. Food: (5/5) The food here is amazing! Their salads were roasted/seasoned very well and was surprisingly one of the more memorable parts of the meal. We ordered the Mediterranee Raclette and the Raclette Burger, both of which were presented with a hot slice of cheese on top.When the cheese got cold, it was like eating a cheese chip - sooo gooood.Raclette Burger with Truffle Cheese: I felt weird ordering a burger at a French restaurant, but I was really hungry and wanted something filling. In this dish you get a 6oz sirloin with a side of sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were so good. It was definitely the best sweet potatoes fries I have ever eaten. The outside was crispy while the inside was soft and rich with sweetness. And to top it off with sea salt just balanced the flavors very well. The burger was very juicy and was amazing with the truffle cheese.Mediterranee Raclette: This is a great salad for anyone, as it is seasoned very well, and provides many different flavors in one meal."
4588,"If you're naming a restaurant after a specific dish I  expect that the execution of that dish to be top of the game. However, this was not the case. The cheese was amazing, but the bulk of the dishes was the steak and potatoes. That was very underwhelming. I asked for medium rare and the beef did come out pink,but it was actually so over cooked and very tough. The potatoes tasted like they weren't seasoned either, if not for the cheese it tasted like nothing. I decided to try after hearing all the hype and videos of slicing cheese but I think you can pass on this one."
4589,"This place was so cool! We made an indoor dining reservation a few weeks in advance, and the table was pretty well-distanced from other customers. The service was great. I ended up ordering one of the Raclette dishes where they come to you and scrape the cheese onto the plate, and it did not disappoint! Not only was it a cool experience, but it also was DELICIOUS! I'd definitely come back if I am back in town."
4590,"Root & bone is an amazing little spot for brunch. The food was amazing, service was great & it was very easy to make a reservation. They did not require a credit card to reserve and I was even able to call & add one person last minute. Unfortunately it did take an hour after our reservation to get seated but the restaurant was very transparent from the start regarding the wait. There is an enclosed outdoor space & an indoor space. For brunch we enjoyed the mimosas & Arnold Palmers. The mimosas came with a bottle of champagne and orange/peach juice. The Arnold Palmers were not too sweet and were very refreshing. For food, we enjoyed the chicken sandwich, the shrimp & grits, the chicken & waffles, & of course the gluten free biscuits. I would highly recommend going here for brunch!"
4591,"Root & Bone is a charming, little spot in the East Village and if brunch is what you're craving, you will not be disappointed (I haven't tried dinner there yet but I'm sure it's just as good). The restaurant itself is small, but they've managed to squeeze quite a few tables in there. I mean you'll almost be elbow-to-elbow depending on where you're sitting, but that's part of the charm!We started with a couple mimosas and appreciated the 80/20 ratio of prosecco to OJ. I had the Sweet Potato Avocado Not Toast, which is avocado, tomato, pepitas and radishes on top of a roasted sweet potato, and topped with sweet potato crisps. Served with a large kale salad on the side. A stunning presentation. It was very good, but man that sweet potato will fill you up quick. I got through about 2/3 by the time I was full. My bf got the braised short rib meatloaf and eggs, which came with 3 fried hash brown balls and a small kale salad. He loved it. The meatloaf was super tasty. I was all about those hash browns. They mix a little cheese in there so each bite is crispy, cheesy, potato-y deliciousness. Mmm...I feel a little silly not having tried the fried chicken given that's one of the things they're most known for, but hey there's my reason to go back!"
4592,"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and I finally had the chance to with a friend for the fried chicken dinner. The interior is super cute and cozy, with white brick walls that have little yellow candles, wood tables, cool glass lights, and nice table settings. The fried chicken dinner is $26 per person & included deviled eggs, buttermilk biscuits, sweet tea brined fried chicken, and a choice of two sides. For our sides, we selected mac and cheese, buckwheat waffles, as well as an autumn vegetable dish. We weren't able to pick only 2 sides! We were served the deviled eggs and biscuits first. The deviled eggs were plated beautifully in a lovely pink egg shell with pickled beets, along with herbs and root chips. The egg filling was creamy and smooth filled with flavorful spices. I really enjoyed the glazed biscuits, which came with a honey chicken jus with a side of sea salt, sesame seeds and rosemary. Those biscuits were still warm, wonderfully flaky, delightfully buttery, and didn't even need the honey chicken jus.Then came the sides. My favorite was the mac and cheese, which was topped with a biscuit herb crust. The pasta was perfectly cooked, while the cheese was nice and crunchy. Overall, the dish had an extreme cheesiness level and plenty of great seasoning. I also liked the vegetables, which consisted of butternut squash, pumpkin, pepitas in a satisfyingly sticky sweet sauce. The buckwheat waffles were pretty good and came with bourbon maple syrup. I liked how the waffles were quite crispy and there was strong taste of bourbon in the syrup. Then came the impressive looking main course of fried chicken brined in sweet tea with a sprinkling of lemon powder, in a bucket. This fried chicken had an incredible crispiness, was tender, and bursting with flavor. I couldn't really discern the sweet tea taste, but I didn't mind. It was a tad on the dry side.Service was solid throughout. The waitress was friendly and everything came out in a timely manner. I would like to return in order to try the Barbecue Bruleed Spare Ribs, Mojo Pork Chop, and Truffled Tater Tots."
4593,"Came here on a Saturday afternoon for brunch. Make a reservation!! It's a cute place with almost a cottage like feel. Very homey. The menu is concise but offers unique plates to choose from. We got the mac n cheese which was not too salty and quite thick! Yum. We each then got our own platters and all of us added fried chicken to our plates. The fried chicken was dry in some areas but the sauces they gave help a lot (honey and hot sauce) Overall, food is definitely on the heavier side but really makes you feel comforted. Would come back as it's perfect for a chilly day."
4594,"Delicious! We came here on New Years Day and were able to walk in with no reservations. My husband and I tried all 3 of their small plates which was the perfect amount because we weren't super hungry.GRANDMA DAISY'S ANGEL BISCUITS - delightful, the honey chicken jus really made the juice. Super unique, I haven't had a biscuit served like this before but now I want all of them to come this way - the perfect dip!DEVILED EGGS - also unique. Great consistency and interesting beet flavor.FRIED GREEN TOMATOES - light & yummy. Could have used a bit more sauce but overall enjoyed!"
4595,"boozy brunch but make it southern. it was love at first sight of the menu so I was eager for brunch!Root & Bone kissed my southern soul. The Fried green tomatoes, and the fresh biscuits had me feeling as if I were down in the delta.The fried green tomatoes were cooked to perfection, sweet and coated to perfection in a crispy thin golden shell. Who wants a soggy tomato - not me! Served with two dipping sauces and topped with a drizzle of a sauce with a lil' kick of spice!  The biscuits were sweet, buttery and not too heavy, not a thick texture that you have to fear of being choked was served with a maple butter like sauce--- delicious l!     Chicken sandwich was amazing, served with a kale, jalapeño salad and pickles delish, naturally I wanted to add it like a slaw on my sammie but it was already stacked and had alot going on! The bottom bun quickly went soggy nearly two bites in. Our server was amazing and brought out a fresh toasted bun to transfer the chicken and toppings over.The brut kept coming, a table of 4, we ended up getting through 3 bottles. Our sever was quick, attentive and super nice! The place is cute but very small. We didn't feel cramped or anything. There is only one restroom and I had a horrible feat that if somehow the latch didn't hold up the entire resturant would have seen my bum. Overall it was pretty clean for the entire restaurant to only use that one and it was fully stocked with the essentials. Will I be back? Yes do I recommend, hell yea"
4596,"Highly recommend making reservation! The stand in area is a bit awkward. Bottomless brunch for $40 with a max of 1.5 hours. Everyone at the table has to participate. Food was okay, nothing special. Service was nice and quick. I think I would explore other bottomless brunch locations, it was a good one time visit."
4597,Came here on a Saturday afternoon. A friend suggested this place and the place did not disappoint. Did outdoor dining. Got the chicken and waffle since that seemed to be the popular choice and plus I love fried chicken. This item was solid and very filling. Also ordered the biscuit n gravy and Mac n cheese which were all delish. Servers were very attentive and the whole experience went smoothly. I would recommend this place for anyone in the mood for southern comfort food. * dog friendly
4598,"I LOVED my food from here, and so did my friend who I came with. We both ordered the waffles with eggs Benedict. She got it with chicken, which she loved, and I got it with a biscuit on the side. The waffles with eggs were incredible and so filling that I had to save my biscuit for later. I ended up sharing it with my family later, and everyone loved it! As a whole, the meal was excellent. It is also important to note that I am very picky about syrup, and their maple syrup (served on the side of course) was great!! The vibe was also great in the restaurant - calming colors and boho decor and waiters wearing flannels. The waiters were also very attentive, checking on us regularly and giving us water every time we ran low without us having to ask at all.  Everything was excellent."
4599,"I was here recently for brunch and this space is a whole vibe. We decided to skip the boozy brunch and ordered drinks and an assortment of apps and entrees for the table. Deviled EggsSweet Tea Brined ChickenShrimp and gritsSide of gritsAngel biscuitsTater totsFRIED GREEN TOMATOES ""BLT* Drinks were excellent, staff was great. Loved the ""blt"" chicken was a touch bland. My one issue with the side of grits is you have to love pimento cheese. I don't. It's fine but I don't love it and it's an aggressive amt foe my personal taste. The grits themselves were excellent nice and creamy the deviled eggs were adorable and tasty."
4600,"I haven't been to many new restaurants in the last year or so due the pandemic and all, but Root & Bone sticks out to me for the incredible food. It's is definitely one restaurant to check out when you're looking for a little weekend pick-me-up and have decided to venture out. It's also a place you're going to want a reservation for. Root & Bone serves southern-style brunch with items like fried chicken and waffles, biscuits and gravy, and grits. I recommend starting with Grandma Daisy's angel biscuits (two for $8) -- so buttery, light, and delicious. For the entrees, you absolutely should get a chicken dish here (or multiple if you're here with a group). I highly recommend the chicken and waffles (sweet tea brined fried chicken with buckwheat waffle and whiskey maple syrup) and the chicken sandwich. The chicken in the chicken sandwich is a little bit spicy and we actually really liked how well it was cooked. We also got short rib meatloaf and eggs, and the cheesy bacon tater tots that came with that dish were the real star.The restaurant has a lovely farmhouse vibes with beautiful mismatched dishes, which provides visual intrigue and makes for cute photos if that's your thing. But really, the food is great and reasonably priced. Easily could be one of my new go-to's for brunch in the city."
4601,"What a treat! Highly recommend for anyone looking for fried chicken in NYC. As a group, we did the chicken supper and it was amazing- added the autumn salad made it that much better."
4602,"Ok I know everyone is looking for a vibe. Well Root & Bone isn't so much about the vibe, but definitely about the food and flavors! And YES they have an unlimited option! The Tipsy aka a Ronald Palmer with Vodka was delicious, as was everything we ordered from their southern style brunch menu. They definitely perfected their chicken. If your meal doesn't come with chicken add it on. The had indoor and outdoor/street seating. We had:-Waffles Benedict + chicken-Friend chicken  & Waffles-Biscuits & sausage gravy -The TipsyI hope Lilith is your server she's the sweetest!"
4603,"I've been to Root & Bone several times over the years and it never disappoints. We came for a weekend brunch recently and didn't have a reservation, so we had to understandably wait an hour to get a table outside. The deviled eggs are a must! There are 4 pieces to an order (it used to be only 3) and the eggs are generously filled with the yolk mixture. The chip on top adds a nice textural crunch to the flavorful egg. At brunch they don't have the fried chicken basket, so I got the fried chicken and waffle dish. The giant waffle was topped with three pie you perfectly fried chicken. The portion was very large and it could easily be shared between two people. I've also ordered delivery from Root & Bone for dinner and the chicken travels well. They know how to make great fried chicken!"
4604,"This is my second time going to this place and it did not disappoint. My friend and I split the fried chicken and waffles and mac and cheese and it was so delicious and filling! The chicken was well seasoned, juicy and crispy. Their mac and cheese is just so creamy and cheesy with a hint of tanginess. They have very cool and interesting options for waffle strips and sauces. This place take comfort food to a new level."
4605,"Overall this place was decent. We arrived and our table wasn't quite ready, which was a little awkward because it's a tight space to wait in and it was raining outside.My favorite plate was the devilled egg dish, they were cooked perfectly and garnished nicely.I also ordered the burrata which was a little less interesting -- basically a blob of cheese over some leaves, it didn't feel well integrated or presented.The Macaroni Cheese was pretty good too, nice and crispy and just the right size.The bartender is extremely talented and the drinks on offer were outstanding. The wine list was a little less impressive but it is a southern cuisine restaurant, so that is fine.Check it out."
4606,"I have not one CLUE why I haven't been to this place before, I've always walked around this area and visited other restaurant on this side of town but I've never experience this GEM of a place. After having it bookmarked on my Yelp for far too long, my friend and I decided that now is the time to check it out. We made a reservation on RESY & it was quick. We chose a weekday because we know how crazy restaurants can be on the weekend now that things are opening up again. There's for first tip ( Go on a weekday). Upon arrival you are asked to have you temperature taken and wear your mask due to Covid you must wear your mask but once you're seated at your socially distant table you are permitted to take it off. The staff wears masks at all times.Because it was a random weekday it was pretty calm, besides us there were only two other tables there. This was great do us because we actually got to speak to our server and she was able to offer us suggestions. We decided on the Fried Chicken Supper which is 25 per person for two people. You get fried chicken, buttermilk biscuits, deviled eggs and your choice of two sides. We chose Mac & Cheese and braised greens. EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING. The atmosphere was so chill that I feel like I was hope eating a family dinner. The biscuits were light and flavorful and comes with a honey chicken Jus that makes it 10 times better they need to bottle that up. Chicken was crispy and light, not overpowered by flower and oil. Greens were good and Mac and cheese was also delicious. We had pistol punch and Tipsy sweet tea and those were great as well. Enough liquor in them both to keep you feeling nice. I have never been so eager to tip at a restaurant. I mean everything was so good and reasonably priced. I definitely have to come back to try the other menu items"
4607,"I came here for a late brunch with a friend on a weekend afternoon after having received glowing recommendations from another friend who said it was the best Southern food he's had in New York. It was quite busy even at 2pm on a Sunday, and we ended up waiting 20 minutes for a table.My friend ordered the biscuits and gravy and I ordered the chicken and waffles. We also got a side of mac & cheese. The waffle I had was quite soft (not really my type of waffle) but the chicken was crispy and juicy. This dish was quite heavy so I ate about 1/3 of the dish before giving up. I tried a bit of my friend's biscuits and gravy which tasted pretty nice. The mac & cheese was quite good and I thought tasted very good with the red sauce they had on the table.All in all, I thought this was a good brunch option. Our bill with the 3 items and no alcohol came out to around 44 dollars. I'm not quite sure that this was everything my friend had touted it to be, but I wouldn't mind going back here for an affordable brunch in the East Village."
4608,"As a Southerner and someone with a gluten allergy, I rarely get to indulge in biscuits and fried chicken. I especially didn't expect to find it in NYC! The experience at Root & Bone was fantastic from start to finish. I went with 3 friends for brunch, and we sat outside. We opted for the boozy brunch option: $45 for bottomless mimosas and tipsy Arnold Palmers + a large plate. While I love a mimosa, especially one you get to make yourself at the table to get the right proportions of orange juice to cava, the tipsy Arnold Palmers were a revelation. So. Good. The gluten free biscuits and fried chicken were everything I'd hoped for. While I found the chicken a tad bland, adding on the hot sauce provided by the waiter made it perfect. I know I'll be dreaming about this meal all the way from Nashville."
4609,"Came here on a rainy Saturday night- really homey vibes and cute interior decor! We got the fried chicken supper for 2 @ 26/pp and an autumn salad to share. The supper comes with deviled eggs, biscuits, fried chicken, and two sides (we got French fries and buckwheat waffles). Food came promptly and service was super friendly! I was not a fan of the pickled eggs as they were a bit rubbery and i didn't like the flavor much but that's personal preference. The biscuits were really good and came w some sort of chicken broth gravy. The supper meal for 2 came w 4 pieces of chicken. (Thigh, breast, wing, and drumstick). The chicken was super crispy and so juicy and tender on the inside. Love their hot sauce!!! The sides were great as well. The salad was refreshing and tasty. They have whisky maple syrup which is cool. I don't like whisky much so I would have preferred regular syrup but it's pretty unique! Would def come back again."
4610,"I came here for lunch yesterday with a couple of my friends. It was the first time I've ever had Southern comfort food and it definitely will not be my last. Everything we had was delicious and full of flavor! What made Root & Bone different than other restaurants was the ordering process. We were given a QR code to scan and it would lead us to the menu. However, we could order too. The app also divides the bill according to each person so it makes splitting the bill a lot easier, since we could each pay for our own tab. I hope other restaurants do this to. I ordered the Two Piece and Biscuit which was a chicken thigh and drumstick with a side of their homemade biscuit and mac & cheese. The fried chicken and biscuit were both delicious and not dry at all. The mac & cheese was also great, however it was a little too much for me. I would recommend anyone to go here and I cannot wait to go back to try something else!"
4611,"Went last night for dinner. They have a pretty good outdoor set up although if it had been hot, the one fan in the corner mostly just blowing on me and not my friend across the table, wouldn't have been sufficient (for anyone else there either). The food was really well made! We had the fried chicken dinner, which came with biscuits and two sides. The biscuits are pretty large: a little on the salty side. Served with honey that could have either been sweeter or hotter to counter the salt. The cheese grits were great and the corn was also good, if unremarkable. I was curious to try the watermelon and pickle salad. Interesting combo. The fried chicken was juicy and had a crackling crust. My only complaints were that the waitress never brought the ice I asked for and also didn't ask if we wanted dessert. Would definitely go again and try some other dishes on the menu."
4612,"I've had this place bookmarked for a long time now, and recently rediscovered it after a friend recommended we come here for brunch.We came on a Sunday afternoon and were given about 15 minutes before were seated. The menu and ordering system are both accessed online, so at the end of your meal, you can pay your check there too! Super efficient and limits contact with servers. We started off the morning with Grandma's Angel Daisy biscuits. There are no pictures because the biscuits really didn't last very long. On to the main course - these chicken and waffles are probably in the top 5 I've ever had. It had all the components -  crunchy/flavored skin, meat that falls off the bone, soft buttery waffles). Paired nicely with the bourbon syrup. I also had a bite of my friends mac and cheese and loveeed it. So I did what any other sane person would do and ordered it to go for dinner. No regrets. This brunch was so good, affordable, and I felt very safe while eating here. Highly recommended and would come back."
4613,Wait staff was very nice and accommodating throughout the meal. Came for brunch and it was really good. The unlimited brunch is definitely the right way to go even if you only have a few glasses each. Got the Braised Meat Loaf and the Chicken & Waffle Combo. I enjoyed the chicken and waffles because the chicken was barely breaded if at all. This appealed to me but should be said as it might be unusually for most. Was less of a fan of the meat loaf but I think that's more on me than it is on the restaurant. Overall very good experience and would be back
4614,"A solid dining experience with good food and a friendly wait staff. The drinks are refreshing and for a hot summer day, so go with the Lavender Lemonade to quench your thirst. The deviled eggs were a good starter, although I did find the yolk a little gritty. The pickling on the whites were excellent though. The fried chicken (brined in sweet tea) had great flavor and was well fried, but the honey tobacco was what put it over the top for me! The buckwheat waffles were crispy and had a nice chew in the middle. Doused in their whiskey maple syrup, the waffle went from a 8 to a 10! They really should bottle that syrup! The biscuits were buttery but I found them to be a bit stodgy. I prefer a flakier biscuit. The chicken jus made for a fun dip though and had really concentrated flavors. The only thing I didn't love was their fried green tomato BLT... and I love green tomatoes.  I wasn't a fan of the sauce and the thick cut bacon needed more crisp. The tomato itself could have used a sprinkling of sea salt.I would definitely go back, although I'd skip the green tomatoes and biscuit."
4615,"Awesome. We went here for brunch based on a friend's recommendation and everyone loved it and complimented and thanked me for introducing them to this place. So let me continue to play it forward for you.Chicken w/waffles: crunchy and not at all greasy. The waffles come with whiskey maple syrup that wasn't cloyingly sweet. Three generous pieces of chicken plus 4 pieces of waffles = #happytummy.Waffle Benedict: the pork belly bacon. Omg, the pork belly bacon. My friend generously shared some with us, which, tbh I would never do cuz I would just eat it all myself. But I know how to pick my friends and you'll be mad happy if you pick this dish.Crispy chicken sandwich: ok, unexpectedly this came with a robust, awesome salad. I mean, don't get me wrong, my friend loved her sandwich but we were all raving about the salad lol.Service was nice, maybe not the most attentive I've had but perfectly cool, nice people working here. The decor is like a cozy country home with very creative repurposing. For example, take a good look at the bar table and lights hanging above it and try to guess what they used to be.It took a while for our food to arrive which is why I don't have any pics. Cuz by the time the food came, we pounced on it like sharks feasting on a pod of seals."
4616,"Came here a few ago with my sister and to say this was good experience is so much of an understatement. We didn't expect much from this place, just something we wanted to try out. Upon walking in we felt right home, (literally) lol. Especially for me being from the south I swore I was in my own kitchen lol. This place had the most comfortable, homey feel. From the old wood decor, to the cupboard with neatly stacked dishes on the wall and the best part, the mini library above the bathroom door. We checked out the menu and had no idea what to get, everything looked good. We went with the $25 meal for 2, which was a mini feast lol. It came with fried chicken, deviled eggs, the best biscuits and jus I've ever had. For side we ordered the collard greens and Mac n cheese and ribs that were topped with honey smacks, yes! You that right Honey smacks cereal. I'm no pork lover but those by far were the best ribs ever. And whoever thought to top them with honey Smacks is genius! We also had the Beekeeper cocktail and vodka lemonade both great drinks. Did I mention we had the restaurant to ourselves most of our stay. Which gave our waiter some time to sit and chat with about the food and establishment. I'm never good with names but she was amazing.... Me and sister were looking a place we could go to regularly with great and customer service. I think we found it!"
4617,"I was in the mood to try somewhere new and Root and Bone caught my eye. They have lots of gluten free options, including fried chicken and biscuits! Walked in without a reservation and the host was able to seat us outside right away. I would probably make a reservation next time because they were busy and I don't know if I'd get this lucky next time. We were drawn in by the specialty cocktails and I ordered the Beekeeper and my boyfriend ordered the Pistol Punch. Both were so nice we ordered another round. For dinner I decided to get the Shrimp and Grits, which they were able to make gluten free and my boyfriend ordered the Braised Short Rib. The service was good and it wasn't very long before our food arrived. I was impressed that for a dish that involves mushy food like grits, there were enough flavors and textures in the dish that I never felt like I was just eating grits. I took a bite of the short rib dish as well and it was equally delicious. I think we were both pleasantly surprised by Root and Bone. It's a bit unassuming on the outside, but the food is thoughtful and nuanced. It might be one of our new favorite places now."
4618,The cutest and coziest brunch spot. Great bar tender and has bottomless drinks with an entree for $45. Biscuits and maple bacon are to die for. Small space so would recommend making a reservation!
4619,"Wow, I can't believe that I had never posted a review for this place. Guess it only took a global pandemic for me to realize. The food here is awesome. They have the souther vibes going, but they still maintain a refined feel to all the food.Now that were through will all the pleasantries, let's get down to the nitty-gritty... the food.Below are some of the things I would definitely recommend you try if you're planning a visit:- Sticky Pork Belly Bacon Bites- Root & Bone Chicken Biscuits- Cheesy Grits- Gooey Sweet Corn Spoon Bread- Avocado Toast (extra toasted)Order any of the above and you can't go wrong."
4620,"You're not only getting the best seafood and soju cocktails, you will also get the warmest servers, bartender and security ever (very rare in NY) Literally one of my favorite dinner vibes Always start with the JUST A DREAM cocktail!!!"
4621,"I came here for my 24th birthday with my girl friends after wanting to come for YEARS, was not disappointed! Drinks are great. Soju sampler is a must!! Food is DELICIOUS & well presented. Staff is polite and friendly. Definitely coming back with my boyfriend!! :)"
4622,Came for the claw feast and it was tasty.  Price was pretty decent for four people. My only issue would be that the mild was pretty spicy lol. But otherwise it was delicious.Oh and the Capri sun like alcoholic drinks are tasty.
4623,"My friends and I came here for an 8PM dinner on a Thursday night. Immediately we were greeted with a temperature check and some friendly hellos. We were seated indoors, which can sound scary during COVID, but all the tables were at least 6 feet apart! (At this moment) NYC indoor dining only allows for 25% capacity, so we were well-distanced from the other tables. Staff members made sure to wear masks as well. I ordered some garlic bread, but it never came! We did have a lot of food, so I can understand how a side can be forgotten; however, I was still a little salty the garlic bread never came. Fortunately, they were able to take the garlic bread off the bill though! But this may be something to watch out for. The mac and cheese is so delicious here! Our waiter told us the regular mac and cheese tastes better than the crab mac and cheese, but I ended up ordering both. The regular order must be made with mozzarella cheese because it was incredibly creamy and pleasant to eat! This is the epitome of comfort food - I could order this all day and night. The crab mad and cheese was also delicious! This one must have been with American cheese/another variant of yellow cheese, as it wasn't as creamy. There was a moderate amount of crab in the dish, but for double the price and half the creaminess, I would skip this and go for the regular mac and cheese. For my main course, I ordered one pound of garlic butter shrimp. As artery-clogging as this may be, this tasted so amazing! So bad for the heart, so good for the soul. Not a friendly acquaintance for those on a diet, but if you're on a cheat day or feel okay with diving into a sea of garlicky butter, then go on ahead!! Overall, Claw Daddy's was a pretty cool experience! If I am in the area and need to stress eat on some seafood and mac and cheese, then I'll make sure to come back here!"
4624,"I love claw daddy's. I've been on numerous occasions .I enjoy the seafood boil,the live D.J As well as the service.last but not least their Capri sun alcohol beverage is in this adorable pouch full of flavor ."
4625,"Let me start out by saying that I come here all the time and I usually get great service. I travel all the way from upstate NY about an hour and a half to come here. I can understand on a Saturday night the service may not be up to par but definitely not on a Saturday at 12pm. I ordered an oyster po boy that took 35 minutes to come out once it did it wasn't hot at all, come to find out the 2 dozen oysters I ordered 30 min ago were never put in. So the manager comes out and says she can't take it off the bill because it wasn't hot enough to my liking, wtf?? I don't even eat piping hot food!!! But I do want it warm, with fries that aren't cold."
4626,Delicious seafood boil. We had the gumbo shrimp and snow crab legs. Great portions and their special sauce is amazing. The outdoor seating is very spacious and service is friendly.
4627,"I found out about ClawDaddy's from following someone on IG & since I knew I'd be visiting NY in a week, I made reservations. They didn't disappoint. We have 2lb of Crawfish/ 1lb of Shrimp w/ CD boil seasoning, 1/2 grilled oysters, red beans & rice, chicken wings & 2 caprisuns. We ate every ounce of food before leaving!!"
4628,"this is my second time having a horrible experience here. what's sad is i actually love this restaurant however, the customer service from the host is disgusting. She has a passive aggressive attitude, i came into the restaurant at 6:20 with no reservation. She told us there would be a 30 minute wait, ( which is fine). The host proceeded to tell to wait at the bar and we would be able to wait there and order drinks while we wait. The bartender was very nice but, we ended up waiting for an hour. keep in mind the host was seating people who came after us very quickly (they had no reservation). I calmly and softly asked her how much longer woukd we have to wait, she then said ""well i asked you if you were eating at the bar you said yes, so you'll have to wait an extra 30 minutes"" very rudely. I've never said i was going to eat at the bar, the hostess was very rude."
4629,"Can we talk about how amazing this place is? The service is AMAZING! Like so effing AMAZING! The general manager Alesi is a saint for saving our party of 4. A lot of people compare the boil to claw daddy's and about 2 year ago, I was all for the Boil. But OMG, Claw Daddy has def stepped their game up. I'm official on Team Claw Daddy!"
4630,"Man...listen bro, don't come here. I just spent $150 on 4LBS AND 2 Margaritas. I got garlic butter and it's ass man....the flavor isn't even in the crab legs. It's like the just threw the seasoning juice on the crab and microwaved the food. I'm honestly truly disappointed. Came here trying to impress my lady, and I'mLeaving by myself. So I'm down $150 and ain't getting no buns. It's all bad. Please go to another place. The staff is amazing, look and Brand is Amazing! Great place for pictures BUT, the food is not seasoned well. I'm so disappointed I may go get some French fries honestly...Margarita  is ok"
4631,usually awesome except this Friday I ordered 2lbs of shrimp and by the time I ate it around 1 am it was bad.  Mind you it was purchased by 5pm.
4632,"Reserved a table for 4 for indoor dining on a Saturday. We were seated promptly after a temperature check at the door. We ordered the king crab legs in claw daddy's special sauce and requested spicy for an extra kick, the grilled oysters - which I'd describe as delicious garlicky/buttery goodness, and a side of Brussels sprouts- surprisingly satisfying. For drinks we had the Matilda & Mardi Gras caprisuns, both were tasty and refreshing.During covid the whole indoor dining experience felt completely safe and we all had a great time dining in. There was plenty of social distancing within the restaurant, the servers were friendly and attentive, and the food was delicious!"
4633,"Claw daddy's is always packed so I suggest you make a reservation in advance. The seafood is always fresh, sold by the pound. The adult Capri suns are super official. The Mardi Gras is the one with passion fruit and it's the strongest, my second favorite is the Mathilda."
4634,"If you're a lover of seafood, great drinks and excellent music then I  highly recommend attending this amazing restaurant!!! My girlfriend and I have been attending the LES location for 5 yrs now and have not been disappointed. We have celebrated milestones in our lives here, my parents had their wedding anniversary dinner here, and the list goes on lol. If you love to eat crab legs while singing to some of the best r&b music then stop scrolling and make the reservation!"
4635,First time back since Covid. The menu is a little different but the same great service and taste!!
4636,"* garlic noodle / online ordering review *While my boyfriend was cooking up our Valentine's Day dinner, I wanted to add a side dish I was randomly craving: garlic noodles. Sadly this dish is not in my bf's repertoire and I didn't even give him much notice, so I had to rely on takeout for this one. Not a big deal. I did a quick search on yelp (garlic noodles in New York, NY) and Claw Daddy's was the first to show up. It's conveniently located walking distance from us, so I didn't mind making a quick stop after work on Friday to pick it up.We'd never been to this seafood establishment, so I did feel a little weird placing the order online (directly on their website) JUST for a $6 order of noodles. Do people usually do this? Would the restaurant be mad that I didn't order any crab legs with my noodles? Oh well, I bit the bullet and ordered for a 6:30pm pickup. It was all ready to go when I walked through the doors a couple min early, so they are def punctual.I had to walk the order for 10ish min in 18 degree weather before I got home, so it was expected that I had to pop it into the microwave for a quick reheat. It smelled so good, I was so excited. Upon taking our first bites, we were BLOWN AWAY. So incredibly garlicky. I can't even imagine how good it is fresh from the kitchen, in the restaurant. We should've gotten 2 orders, 1 per person. We would 100% order JUST the noodles again, with zero shame this time. Sign us up. So so so good. Didn't think I'd write a review since I didn't have the full dining experience, but the noodles were so delicious that I had to."
4637,Great food and even better service. The seafood was fresh and the sauce I paired with it was amazing. The only thing I wouldn't order again is the garlic bread is was bland and a bit hard.
4638,"I went here during happy hour and the deals are insane! My boyfriend ordered the wings which are $1 each during happy hour and I ordered the $1.50 grilled clams, both were AMAZING. We also ordered the mac and cheese as well and it was also pretty good. The adult caprisuns were $9 during happy hour and were a great size. Made with Soju and I was still able to get a buzz half drink in. I also ordered a pound of snow crab legs with butter cheese medium sauce...it came piping hot and full of flavor. I paid for corn (I believe it was $3) and that was for about 3 little pieces, could've done without it. Overall, very good lunch and I will definitely visit again."
4639,The happy hour is good.... Baked clams and oysters are the way to go :-) The boil seafood is Also good too. I absolutely love the garlic noodles :-)
4640,Amazing establishment! Worth the wait for every bite. I went at 2am and the line was out the door in the rain but it moves so quickly and efficiently. Definitely hyped up but so good!
4641,"I saw Bobby Flay post about this location and make a recommendation.. So when I realized they opened a location in the Broadway/Times Square area I was so excited! This is the perfect place for a classic, thin crust, greasy, cheesy New York slice. I went on a Wednesday evening after I got out of an 8 PM show and there was a line out the door. It still moved fairly quickly. I got a plain slice for $4, so good. Exactly what I expected. There were plenty of people though that came out with whole pies! The place is pretty small, only a few small high top tables and counter areas to stand at but it's perfect for grab and go. And they're open late! While this location isn't on the main road, not near the bright lights of Times Square and the Broadway theaters, it is not far at all. I would recommend passing the other knock-off type chains and visiting this established location for an authentic slice."
4642,"We were visiting for NY for my wife's birthday, and were looking for good pizza along the way while we walked to the Empire State Building. A couple in Bryant Park overheard us and directed us to Joe's Pizza a block over - and it did not disappoint! We wanted the NY pizza experience and this place is it. It was crazy packed, but it moves quickly. No sitting around and relaxing here, meant as a grab and eat quickly or a grab and go. Worth it. The pizza is the perfect mix of crunchy and chewy pizza dough, and didn't have too many toppings to where it wouldn't hold up. So so so delicious. Go and grab some asap!"
4643,"We went on recommendation to this place. There are many neat photos of celebrities eating Joe's pizza on the walls. Looks like they were taken at a different Joe's location. I had a slice of pepperoni. The sauce was bland compared to other pizza we have had on this trip. The margarita pizza, the tomatoes and mozzarella were still somewhat cold. The serving model is order your slices, they toss them in the oven to warm and hand them back when you pay. So they are in the oven for 1-2 minutes. Not enough time to heat back through. It was ok."
4644,"wowowowowow. my first slice of new york pizza was at Joe's and I'm STILL blown away. I ordered a cheese ""plain"" pizza (just one) for dinner. I came on a Thursday night around 6pm. It was a gloomy/foggy day so I was expecting a short line - but the line was out the door and spilling into the sidewalk as usual. Don't let the line fool you, it moves quick! My cheese pizza was $3.75 and it was a big slice! They heat up the pizza perfectly and my crust was not burned at all. The pizza itself is salty, fragrant, crispy, hot, and just plain delicious. Worth every penny and worth the wait in line. Highly highly recommend that everyone comes to Joes. They have condiments (cheese, red pepper flakes, pepper, oregano) on the tables. Payments under $5 must be made in cash - but they accept credit card for orders over $5. Workers here are pretty friendly. There's no seats really, but plenty of space to stand around and eat!"
4645,"Typical but very good NY pizza. Always a favorite quick bite while walking around Times Square. Line is always long but worth the wait. I recommend getting a whole pie if more than 2 people because a whole pie somehow looks and tastes better than a slice...  yes, therés a hint of implication there that it's by design(?)!!!!"
4646,"It's a little tough to find great pizza in southeast Virginia. A lot of places talk about having NY style, but they have no idea what they're song with the ingredients. So when in Manhattan, we got our much needed pizza fix. And Joe's is about the best place to get it. Perfect large slice. Thin, crispy and chewy crust, good quality sauce and cheese, fresh toppings. And the staff is awesome. They have such a small space, but they are so fast and organized with taking the order and slamming those slices in the oven. 27 bucks for 4 slices and 2 bottles drinks isn't cheap, but hey, welcome to Times Square!"
4647,"When in New York, ya gotta have New York-style pizza, so I heard Joe's Pizza was a good spot for it.  And it certainly was.  It's the kind of pizza slice that's reliable, affordable and solid, so I can see why people are fans. We visited Joe's Pizza on a Sunday night, and the place had a short line; but it went by swiftly.  Although the shop itself is on the smaller side, many people were getting takeout, and there was also a heated, covered outdoor dining area that many people were eating their slice at, so we didn't have an issue finding a countertop to eat at.  I saw many takeout orders of whole pies going out.  It was a popular spot, especially since it's located in Times Square.I ordered a slice of the supreme pizza, which the staff warmed up.  It was a good slice of pizza, with sausage, pepperoni, mushroom and red onions.  Not much to this pizza; but I say, simple, classic pizzas hardly ever get it wrong.  Was it the best pizza I've ever had?  Well, no.  But it was good - and it was floppy enough for me to fold, which gives it the signature NY-style pizza flair.  I dig it."
4648,"Let's just say this is my go-to place whenever I visit NY! Ever since my best friend said to try out this place, it's been my favorite place when I want pizza!The place is a bit tiny to eat inside because it's crowded but you can eventually find space considering people seem to eat pretty quick and leave or take their food outside or take it for takeout. The line can sometimes go outside and can be like a 5-10 min wait at around 10pm on the weekend but it's definitely worth the wait! I usually get pepperoni pizza and get a second slice if I'm super hungry. I definitely love this place and it's worth eating here if you want some good pizza. I would recommend trying it out considering it's pretty close to Time Square."
4649,"The infamous Joe's Pizza just had to be our first eats of New York. Was this place overhyped? Most definitely. Had their Supreme Pizza and it was decent, it had pepperoni, red onions and mushrooms which is also a good combo. Honestly just tasted like a pizza to me and nothing really special not incrediably exciting about it. A bit too much on the chewy side if anything. Also tried a bit of their Caprese and it wasn't too bad, cheese was good but I'm not a fan of tomatoes so probably just not for me in general. This spot is small and pretty damn close to Times Square so prepare yourself for a line and taking it else where to eat because it could get crowded!"
4650,"Best pizza in New York. Thin crust, pepperoni covered.Piping hot and fresh.  They crank them out as fast as they can.  The line is out the door even at 2:00 pm But you won't wait long in the line.Definitely a must have if you are near Times Square."
4651,"Came here after eating some really bad ramen and Joe's literally saved the night! First time trying NY pizza and we got the cheese and supreme. The pizza is so thin, cheesy, and yummy. I loved both of them! The line went by really fast and we just ate it outside right away. The 2 slices costed around $8 which was not too bad in my opinion. Great for a quick late night bite."
4652,Ignored by staff because the server a friend first .Happened multiple times.Probably happens all the time
4653,Doesn't look like much and the line was long but these guys know what they are doing.. The line moves quickly and pizza was awesome!!!
4654,"Just a solid NY style pizza. What else can I say?I got the cheese (or ""plain"" as the locals call it) and the flavor is good, and the texture is very good. However, nothing that was special, per say. I'll definitely be going back to try the other pizzas."
4655,"My brother and I opted for slices of cheese pizza at Joe's Pizza after watching Lion King at the Minskoff Theater. It always hits the spot! This Joe's Pizza is located near the theater district in Time Square. It's about a 5 minute walk from the theaters.  Don't let the lines deter you. It moves relatively quick! A slice of cheese pizza will run you about $3.25/slice and it's well worth it! This NY style pizza has the perfect ratio of cheese, sauce and crust.Happy eating!"
4656,"We came here for late night food after the bars! This is my friend's favorite spot for pizza, and she's local to Manhattan. I can understand why. At 3am, this place had a long line out the door, but it went quickly. We got a GIANT pizza to split, and they were able to accommodate half cheese and half supreme. So good. The three of us splitting the pizza still had a fourth of the pizza for leftovers, it's gigantic. Great spot for late night food in NYC!"
4657,"Pizza snack after an entire day exploring NYC? YES PLEASE. This place was recommended to me by friends and it did not disappoint at all !Many reviews mention a long wait/line, but since it was already 8:30pm , maybe the dinner rush was done! We waited only about 20 minutes for our piping hot slices of cheese and margherita pizza. I loved the fresh slices of tomato and mozzarella on the margherita and the thin crust of the pizza. We honestly ate our slices of pizza so fast hence my attached blurry photo I had to screenshot from my Instagram story. The pizza was too delicious to wait to take multiple photos.If you're coming to visit NYC then stop by Joe's for your pizza craving!"
4658,This place is amazing! Was walking down the strip and asked an officer whats the closest pizza place that's good. He recommended Joe's pizza which happen to be the famous one starred in the Spider man Movie. He did warn me that there might be a long line. I took my chances and got lucky! There was no line and was greeted by the staff. They are all so hardworking and the cashier was very friendly and funny! It takes you back through memory lane with all the famous celebrities that have stopped by here. Pizza was amazing! The mushrooms however did have a weird smell to it but overall great experience. This is a must go to place if youre in the area!
4659,"This place does NOT disappoint when you're craving a slice of New York pizza. Piping hot and super quick - this hit the spot for a 10am breakfast / lunch (or really good for any time in the day). Thin crust, just the right amount of sauce (was bit too much on the sweeter side for me), and hot cheese on top. I got a slice of pepperoni and mozzarella and inhaled both. A contender for my favorite pizza place in NYC."
4660,"Yum perfect for a quick bite. They even reheat the pizza for you! Very thin crust and very tasty. Got the white sauce with spinach and garlic and a pepperoni. Quick, easy and delicious!"
4661,A tourist stop so expect long lines. We ordered pepperoni and sausage mushroom slice - $3/4 per slice. The crust was thin and had a good oven toasty flavor. The pizza was not overloaded with cheese. Overall the wait was worth it.
4662,"If you want to play tourist while in NYC, you HAVE to stop by Joe's. We were craving pizza as I was in town for a work trip back in September 2021, and we started asking locals and police officers around Times Square where to get the best pizza--THEY ALL RECOMMENDED JOES!Hands down the BEST decision of this trip. We were NOT disappointed. I'll admit, they're very busy but the staff is very fast and efficient and you'll get your pizza within 10 mins of waiting even if the line feels really long at first. The cool thing about Joe's is it's somewhat of a landmark as well as many celebrities have passed through to grab a slice throughout the years. It was very cool to see photos of Leonardo DiCaprio and Lenny Kravitz on the walls. Joe's was even featured in the Spider-Man film. All that to sauce, we were NOT disappointed. In fact, we ended up eating at Joe's twice while staying in NYC as they're open late night. I tried the pepperoni, cheese and caprese pizza. 10/10 recommend! Tastebud overload. If you're visiting NYC, make sure you grab a slice for yourself and take a bite. (reviewing this makes me wish there was a Joe's near me--I'm in California, lol)"
4663,"Wanted New York pizza while we were staying in midtown and of course, saw all the good reviews and decided to try it out.We first went on a weekday evening around 6 and the line went outside. We decided to come back the next day in the afternoon and there was no wait. The pizza is classic New York pizza. Big slices with thin crust and crunch. When eaten fresh, it's delicious so we ate it right outside in their seating area! It was enjoyable but I wouldn't say it's all that different from other New York pizza places. We tried another on a whim and it was just as good! I'd come back here for a quick slice as long as there wasn't a wait! Expect waits in the evening due to tourists!"
4664,"Asked for mushroom, they said ""no"". Pie was burnt - both slices. Long line. Wouldn't do it again. More of a novelty"
4665,"Joes is a classic NYC staple and I like the fact that Joes is super speedy. Their pizza is mediocre, it's good but it's not great! I did enjoy the price - we paid $18.50 total for 2 drinks and 4 slices. It gets insanely crowded but I think that's to be expected. Probably wouldn't go again."
4666,"So I went to Joe's because I heard this was THE PLACE for a NY slice. There was a line out the door but it moves fast. It's dope to walk in to see all these different types of HUGE pies. I just got a regular pepperoni slice. The slices are like $4. I was like it's HUGE so I only need one, and I regret it  The slices are soooo thin so they weren't that filling. The crust has a good crisp to it and is slightly fluffy on the inside. Good sauce and cheese ratio. It was good pizza. Definitely not the best I ever had, but I wouldn't mind going back. They say this one is a quintessential NY slice. I definitely wanted to try other slices while in New York but I didn't get a chance to. But I'll be back! Joe's gave me a good taste of NY pizza though! IG: @destinys.eatsYoutube: Destiny's EatsFacebook: Destiny's EatsTikTok: destinyseats"
4667,"I strolled by this pizza spot one day and was amazed by the long line at this establishment! My bf raved to me about this spot and that it was one of his favorite pizza spots..so naturally I had to try it out for myself to see the hype! I'm not a big fan of lines at all and I'm sure no one likes to wait - but if I hear that these pizza slices are the best in town, you'll see me happily waiting in that line patiently. The mozzarella slice was so worth the wait y'all..Let me tell you, from the perfect ratio of cheese to sauce to the thinness of the crispy crust and freshness..wow! I finished up my slice and was already thinking about coming back next time to order me a whole pie. The staff at this establishment are all super friendly and efficient. They knew how to keep the line moving and are super quick. I can't wait to come here again!"
4668,"Very satisfying and tasty pizza. But tbh, for the most part I've really only known NY pizza, so I can't say the pizza I had was anything that blew me away. I would've given Joe's 4 stars. It was comparable to Gino's, a chain out on LI where I grew up. After realizing I gave Gino's FIVE stars, I decided Joe's deserves no less than 5 stars.For a packed restaurant, speed of service was not bad. I am sure this restaurant, especially with all the celebrities you see on the wall that have visited, is used to being busy. I give the employees a lot of credit for serving great food without making customers wait. The cashier was also super nice. When we asked for extra plates, he said, ""Why not?"" and gave us several extra with a smile.People of Joe's, you're very appreciated, and you've made a few more customers happy. :)"
4669,"Decided to come here right after checking in the hotel. I wanted some New York Pizza! I ordered a slice of pepperoni and a slice of cheese pizza. It was very good! thin and alot of cheese! I loved everything about it.Some things I didn't like about the place was it was VERY crowded. It was very small inside. There was not alot of places to sit. we ended up eating outside on the counter.  It was dirty there too. They need to have someone wipe down their countertops. Would I come back? Probably not. The pizza was good, but the place itself was not. I would rather go to another pizza place where I have a place to sit and it is clean."
4670,"The holy trinity of pizzas is what I got here so good, crust baked to perfection and each ingredient put together on a pie was amazing. I'm not a crust eater but I ate the whole slice and enjoyed each and every bite !"
4671,"Delicious! We ordered a full pie and it was hot and made to order (obviously). We got half mozzarella and half combo. The slices are huge, crust is thin, plenty of toppings. New York means New York pizza and you can't go wrong with Joe's pizza!"
4672,"I wanted to try some authentic New York pizza while I was visiting, so my friend recommended Joe's since we were near Times Square.Service was super quick; we were in and out of there within 5 minutes on a Tuesday evening around 7 pm. I forgot exactly how much I paid, but it was around 5 bucks for a slice of the Caprese.There's some limited seating there, but we decided to eat outside at one of the tables in Times Square. It was a short walk of 1-2 blocks.I prefer my pizza with thick crust (deep dish is my favorite), so I've always been skeptical of New York pizza, but I surprisingly enjoyed my Joe's slice. The crust was thin yes, but it was also extremely crunchy, very possibly the crunchiest pizza crust I've ever had. There could've been a little bit more sauce on the slice, but I thought it was already pretty good.Next time I'm back in New York, I'd love to try one of the dollar slice spots and compare it to Joe's!"
4673,"Came here for lunch after craving pizza for the whole entire week!The mozzarella pizza was $4 and for the price I thought it was ok. It definitely could have been a little bit better and hotter. Because the slice was thin, the pizza cooled down very fast even though they reheat it before you pay. I went a friend, and it seemed like hers was piping hot. The bottom of the pizza was perfectly crispy and did not get soggy at all while I was eating it however which is always amazing. There was a line, but it went by very fast. In the future, I think I would probably go for a different pizza flavor."
4674,"If you're in NYC, you have to try Joe's Pizza. It's arguably the best pizza in NYC. When we first arrived, this was the first place we stopped at. The line was long, but it moved fast. I'd say we waited about 15 to 20 minutes. Was the wait worth it? Hell yes! We got 1 Caprese, 1 Cheese, and 1 Supreme. They were all delicious. I'm a simple guy so I enjoy a classic cheese pizza. Joe's does it right. From the flavor to the crust, it's all there. New York style at its best. One bite, everyone knows the rules rating? This would be a 9.9. Yes, I said it!"
4675,"Mama Mia!!! Holy crap Joe's Pizza is sooooo goood. My mouth is watering as I think about the thin, crispy slice of Pizza I had here. We came here after a long day and we sure did get lucky because not even 2 minutes after we walked in the line was out the door.  Their line moved fairly quick,  service was decent,  there is indoor and some outdoor seating.The Pizza was freaking so good. I loved it so much I ended up coming back the next day and having some more slices myself.  I didn't like the pepperoni by far the cheese was the winner for me. The sauce and crust mmm so good I would come back again and highly recommend!!"
4676,"This was my first food stop in New York. To be honest I did not even asked what was all the hype about. I just wanted something to eat after the long flight and airport ride to the city.The line was pretty long when we got there but the wait was under 30mins. It is a really small place and it was very hot in NY at the time. Once you make it to the counter, you make your pizza selection (either from the glass or order a whole one), then you wait for them to warm it up (or cook it) in the oven. I waited no more than 5mins I believe. Once your pizza is ready, they call you up at the register and you pay.Again, small place. You can take your pizza home (hotel) or you can eat there and admire all the pictures on the wall. These are pictures of famous people. It was entertaining just to try to figure out who was who on the pictures. The sitting is along the wall and they have maybe 2 tables in the center. There is also sitting outside but its a little dirty and its along the wall. It is not ideal to go on a date, to go eat and chat with friends etc. this place is ideal to go eat delicious pizza, enjoy the wall and whatever, Yelp review and then get out so other people can eat :p Also, apparently this pizza was featured on the Spider-Man movie so there is that too."
4677,"Oh, boy. I heard so many good things about Joe's but my experience was anything but good. At first I thought the delivery driver was responsible for the toppings being unevenly placed (sliding everywhere), but I don't think it was. Pricey, overcooked and sloppy. Down to give it another shot in person, but really disappointed with this particular experience."
4678,"I recently traveled to New York and stayed at the Luma Hotel just down the street.  My friend and I ordered Joe's pepperoni pizza twice during my short trip.It was delicious and definitely met all expectations of typical New York pizza.  The crust was just a little tough to bite through, but might just be something to get used to.  Still delicious!!!"
4679,"Joe knows pizza. Even after all these years, people wait in line for one of the original pizza bosses. Undercarriage is always perfect. Real cheese. Real sauce. Real dough."
4680,First place I ate in NYC was Joe's pizza and it did not disappoint.  I had the caprese pizza and loved it. The crust was sos crispy and thin. Definitely will try the other pizzas
4681,"It lives up to the hype. Claims to be the best (or one one of the beat) and it definitely was a good slice at the end of a night. The vibe is a long line and pictures of famed celebrities visiting Joe's - from the Kardashins to DiCaprio and whoever else. The lines move fast and they had plenty of options at the counter. Decent amount of seating room as well.Food: everything was being freshly made and tossed onto the counter as you wait and decide on your pizza. The crust was phenomenal, perfectly crispy without being overdone. Sauce was on point, flavorful, fresh and not too much to make the pie heavy.Personally had:-Mushroom and pepperoni - 5/5 - would get this again. -Spinach - 4/5 - good slice but the white pizza was a bit heavier and spinach on the watery side.Excited for the trip back already"
4682,Quick service right in the heart of Times Square. The line was long however very quick! The slices are typical NY style slices meaning large so be mindful of how many you get. The flavor was good and it wasn't super greasy. Really nice and friendly guys working there. Great prices too.
4683,New York trip wouldn't be complete without Joe's Pizza. Finally got to have it on my fourth day. One slice is enough for one person with average appetites. The pizza was flavorful and the crust was crisp. Would go back again on my next New York trip
4684,I can say this is the best tourist trap pizza I ever had. I enjoy a good tourist trap and this one I enjoyed the most with a slice of Joe's pizza. Among one of the best pizza slices I ever had. The inside has pictures of celebrities who dropped by to have a slice. Unfortunately none stopped by this time but the real celebrity was the slice of Joe's pizza. Kevin Bacon approved.
4685,"We spent a full day of our NYC trip walking around, trying and comparing pizzas around the city. It's safe to say Joe's remains our favorite because just when we thought we were all pizza'd out... we stopped by for seconds at their other location on our way to the airport lol! The service is great, pricing is fair and the pizza is always piping hot and delicious. Even when we brought the pizzas back to our hotel and they weren't steamy hot anymore they were still delicious! I have nothing negative to say about our visits to both locations."
4686,A trip to NYC is not completed without coming here. Recommended by Spiderman. Say less. 11/10.
4687,Did you really come to NY if you didn't get a slice? I'm not big on pizza but NY style is probably my favorite because of its simplicity and the thin dough making the pizza crispy.The pizza itself were good so that takes care of my pizza craving for a long while.Price is high though but stuff were friendly
4688,"It doesn't get better than joes pizza!  Worth waiting in line for the best pizza NYC has to offer.  A great selection and the crispy crust was better than we had anticipated.  A ""must eat"" if your in the city!"
4689,"Joe's never fails to deliver, great pizza great choices but don't think you can sit to eat as it is always crowded.  Good atmosphere, friendly staff and very good pricesDefinite recommend"
4690,"Just had one of the best meals I've had in a long time! Started with a Thai iced coffee and it was so sweet and delicious. Shared a pot of burnt rice green tea which was great. Had the crab rangoon and tempura sweet potato appetizer. Both were great, but the crab rangoon is not to be missed. The star of the night was the green curry Thai Ramen. The broth was insanely flavorful and so comforting. The clay pot rice was also wonderful and had so many different flavors that meshed perfectly together. For dessert we had the taro custard brûlée and WOW it was way better than we anticipated. 10/10 would get again. Definitely check this place out! The vibes were also great. Intimate but still fun!"
4691,"I am writing this waiting for the dentist. Because I have braces, and apparently have a sharp bone in the chicken breast is the norm. Which would be understandable if they at least told me about it, but no, let me bite the chicken and break my braces and gum. Oh is that a blood aftertaste in the ramen? Wait no that's just my messed up teeth Also food was sour and poor quality. The ramen tasted like the wisp of what an old man remembers from his childhood. Flavorless. Chicken was cold like it came from the back of a fridge. The servers were rude like I was a hopeless man asking their daughter for marriage Overall the experience was less than subpar. Would not recommend"
4692,"Pretty standard Thai food. Honestly less impressive than the reviews made it out to be, or maybe we went on a super busy day. They sat us so close to another table it was almost as if we were in their conversation. The food was decent thai food though"
4693,"Great food, great service! First time here and had the best time."
4694,"As I am writing this review, I am already planning my next trip to Bua because it was such an amazing experience!Thai cuisine is truly one of the best in the world and Bua truly lives up to that fact. The menu has so many wonderful options and the ambiance is comforting and inviting. When I visited, I started off with the Lychee Mojito and an appetizer of Vegetable Spring Rolls. Typically when I order Mojitos, they taste like mint water but Bua's Mojito was delicious and packed with lychee & mint flavor! I highly recommend any of their drinks with lychee because it's such a delicious addition to most liquors. The vegetable spring rolls were also perfectly crispy and had a flavorful filling!For my meal, I ordered the Pad Kee Mao (Broad noodle, onion, basil, medley tomato, bell pepper, young peppercorns and wild ginger) with Tofu. It was AMAZING. I've had a lot of Pad Kee Mao, but Bua's version hits every note. The vegetables were perfectly cooked and held onto their flavor, the noodles had a wonderful texture and the spice was perfect. Please try their Pad Kee Mao!!My boyfriend accompanied me on this trip and he ended up ordering the Khao Moo Dang (Organic roasted BBQ pork, crispy pork belly, sweetsausage, hard boiled egg and cilantro with brown sauce). He is pretty picky with his food, but he highly approved of his meal and told me that he would like to come back!All in all, Bua is an excellent option if you're looking for consistently delicious Thai food and a very chill atmosphere. They have amazing drinks and vegetarian options. If you're considering stopping by, this is your sign to go!!"
4695,Really enjoy this place-casual enough for a dinner after work but also has great ambiance and a good place for a date night too! The noodles are good and seafood are good quality.
4696,"The place has a nice ambiance. And is a lot larger than I thought. The food is good. I had the drunken noodles with chicken which was well seasoned. Not as spicy as I thought it would be. The Thai iced tea was ok. I didn't like how I was sharing a table with another couple. Despite the space, they really do pack every party into very small areas. I also did not like the feeling of being rushed. As soon as we paid the bill, the waitress told us thet we had to go because another party was waiting for our table. Only about an hour had gone by."
4697,"We were suspicious about a restaurant that serves multiple types of cuisine at one place, but since my friend highly recommended this place, we decided to give it a try. We only ordered Thai dishes from the menu. Overall the food was great. The presentations are especially good and very photogenic. I would highly recommend their crispy duck - no matter it's in the bun or as an added protein in your main dish - it is so satisfying with that deep duck aroma and works so well with everything. The other dishes that we ordered - chicken dumplings, grilled chicken wings, green curry, pad khee mao and pad thai - are very well cooked too. The food is on the heavier and oilier side in my opinion.The interior is cute, and all staff were very nice. They were a bit short staffed when we were there probably because of COVID, but other than that everything was good."
4698,I came here a couple of weeks ago and I must say it was a wonderful experience. We came to try their drinks because we keep seeing them on Instagram. The drinks were good but I could do with a stronger drink; I had the pina colada with the nip. We also had a roll which was good as well and tasted fresh. We did not have any more food because we were full. We sat at the bar and the bartender was amazing we plan to go back to try their happy hour and more of their dishes.
4699,I went to Bui Thai a few years ago and returned and it's still just as good if not better. This time I was able to eat in their outdoor dining and it was soo warm! They have heaters and a big tent to cover you from the cold. For drinks I had the lychee juice and it was so refreshing. For the Appetizers I tried the curry puff which had a great flavor and accompanied by a tangy sauce. The fried wontons were soo good! They handmake their wontons everyday and it's made with minced chicken and fried perfectly. Not to mention it comes with 8 pieces which is so generous and filling. We had to get the soup noodles again since that is what they are know for.  I had the phucket ramen soup which had such an amazing lemongrass soup base with homemade chicken meatball and crispy wonton skins. My hubby had the spicy soy ramen soup and it actually was less spicer than my bowl but had a great flavor still. Lastly for dessert we had the fried icecream and the Chilled Lychee in Butterfly Pea Syrup. Both were so pretty!
4700,"Hello lovely's , back with another review , I was delighted with the great attitude the staff had, it's crowded on the weekend , I only had to wait about 10mints or less , I orders the short rib hash with fried eggs and the dish came with a small portion of salad , I also ordered crispy bacon which was cooked perfectly and biscuits .. Delicious food , however two little pet peeve I have , food came out warm temperature and I like my food hot temperature and it's only one bathroom for all genders , don't like the fact ""MEN"" uses the same bathroom as woman, some ""MEN"" don't put the seat down. Besides that I recommend this restaurant for sure !! Thank you for great service"
4701,I came here for a 2:30pm reservation on a Saturday with my partner. We were seated right away.First and foremost... Thank you to the Buttermilk Channel team for a great experience! Service is friendly and attentive.We were given complimentary bubbly for our engagement. They even offered us a choice of pink or white! My partner & I ended up ordering:* Side of smoked bacon - This actually taste smoky. * Biscuits with butter and a jam/jelly - Watch out cheddar biscuits! You have been dethroned* Short rib hash - Its ribs... of course it's good. * Buttermilk fried Chicken sandwich - Very well balanced(fat/acid) and Jumbo sized! * Classic Bloody Mary.- Isn't too spicy. Which I appreciated  - Pickle is delicious - This is a must! * Salty dog  - This taste like juice be careful. Portions are very generous.Flavors are pretty well balanced. Plates came out promptly.Very well priced. Only positives here. Definitely make a stop if you are in the area.
4702,"This was a very cute brunch spot my girls and I enjoyed this past weekend! My girls and I got the Eggs Huntington, Fried chicken sandwich, Short Rib Hash and the ABC Grilled Cheese sandwich. My fave was definitely the fried chicken sandwich and the eggs Huntington!!The eggs Huntington was made beautifully. The eggs were perfectly poached and runny. The smoked ham was decadent. The buttermilk biscuits tasted great, but was slightly dry. But with the runny eggs, it was fine! The short rib hash had a lot more beef than the potatoes. I typically like a good mix for a hash, but it was good! The short rib was spot on flavor, but a bit dry. The hot sauce they give definitely helps! The fried chicken was crunchy, flavorful and soooo juicy!! Def recommend. Sticky buns were really good in flavor. The inside was warm and fluffy but the outside was a bit hard and dry."
4703,"Great vibes , great good , service was very attentive We got the crab cake special -very Delicious For entrees - the veggie burger ( great flavor and I got a side of mashed potatoes instead of fries - I love the mashed , omg so good ) The Chicken and waffles - a bit pricey for the entree, delicious and filled with flavor  so makes up for the price just a little"
4704,I had wanted to try this place for years. Finally made it for brunch this weekend and I was pretty disappointed. I ordered the chicken sandwich without the bread and my friend ordered the pork chop and waffle. I think the complaints for both were the same. The batter in the chicken and pork is so thick. It's like dough. So it's crispy on the outside but moist and doughy on the inside. It tastes off. Neither of us were fans. I probably should have ordered the warm lamb salad as I originally planned. Their loose tea was delicious though. The atmosphere is cute but it seemed odd to only play music by Black artists and I say that as a Black woman. It really stuck out to me esp considering the location and demographics of the patrons. Not a bad thing just something I noted. I'm not sure I'll be back.
4705,"Went here for a drink pre Lucali. It was in the era of mandatory food for drinks, so I had to pair my drink with some food, and man was I glad I ordered the ABC grilled cheese. It was fire. Service was great and drinks were good also.3.5 round up to 4 cause of the awesome grilled cheese and good ambience."
4706,"I was honestly surprised to be able get a table here first thing in the morning. We showed up a few minutes before they opened up with a reservation and they sat us right away. A long like was starting to form, and pretty soon after all the restaurant was full. I consider myself lucky, but next time I'll be sure to make reservations. My wife ordered their Pecan Pie French toast and I ordered their short rib hash. The French toast were really tasty. They were thick and were really sweet. Perfect for anyone who has a sweet tooth in the morning. It came with bourbon, molasses and roasted Pecans. My short rib has came with two sunny side up eggs, toast and a small side salad. The rib hash was cooked perfectly and they give you plenty of meat mixed in with potatoes and carrots. It was a good dish but I would most likely order something else next time I'm in town. Overall, the staff was great and very welcoming. I would definitely be returning during my next visit."
4707,"This was a stop on an errands day out. And what a stop it was! Apparently well known for brunch, the place was packed inside, so thank you for also having a covid-19 free outdoor option.From the beginning of service to the end, my party of three was thoroughly satisfied. I selected for my mom the fried pork. And OMG wish I ordered ut for myself! When I tell you crunchy and flavorful on the outside, tender and more flavor on the inside... kudos to the chef! In all my dining escapades, this was hands down THE BESTESTESTEST Fried Pork I have had the pleasure of consuming! The waffles had to have hit the spot cause my mom finished it ALL... a rarity. I had the chicken sandwich. I had the opportunity to peep into the kitchen and saw the freshly done chicken staring at me - calling my name. Had to have it. And it did not disappoint. I am not much on restaurant cole slaw, but this version came as close to my kitchen as it could get - not a piece of cabbage remained in the bowl. Even the grilled onions were delectable all by its lonesome (grammatically incorrect). The fries were salted (not my thing but I did forget to ask for unsalted fries). That aside, they were truly crispy right out the pot.My Yelp buddy, Minah, got the Eggs benedict which she said was very nicely done. I can only reiterate her sentiment. The leftovers - cause it was sooo much food, great bang for the buck - did not stand a chance. I don't think it lasted more than 15 minutes after getting home.So yes, I plan a revisit... soon... before it gets too cold to dine outside."
4708,"Buttermilk Channel is now accepting reservations! My boyfriend and I didn't have one, but we came right at opening and got seated. A ton of people were lining up behind us, so definitely come early or make a res.Short rib hash, pecan pie French toast and hash browns were all fab, per usual. Still one of my favorite brunch spots in NYC."
4709,"Dined at Buttermilk Channel for both brunch and dinner over the last several weeks, with an overall positive experience.As others have noted - due to popularity, reservations are highly recommended (or prepare for egregious wait times).  Overall impression - solid fare, excellent service, and a nice ambiance.  I think their brunch menu is overrated.  On the plus side, the bar makes a fantastic Bloody Mary, with just the right amount of kick/spice.  The Eggs Huntington was okay (their version of Eggs Benny).  The eggs (while cooked perfectly) lacked seasoning (salt) and the homemade biscuit overpowers the dish (the ratio of egg to biscuit was off).  Eggs Huntington is served over a bed of greens - but this dish really calls for a side of fries or a basic hash, which you can order for an additional $6-$7.  I don't like the add-on gimmicks restaurants employ to increase average check size by not making the dish as should be intended. I'm more partial to their dinner menu.  The appetizers we selected were okay.  Our table ordered the Popovers and Smoked Trout Rillettes.  The Popovers seem more like a pastry dessert item and the Trout Rillettes were a bit bland.  For mains, the table ordered the Burger, the infamous Buttermilk Fried Chicken, and the Duck Meatloaf.  The Burger was cooked to perfection (medium rare) - juicy, well seasoned, and served with a side of delicious French fries.  The Buttermilk Fried Chicken speaks for itself - tender and juicy pieces of dark meat chicken over cheddar waffles.  Yum!  While I did not sample this dish myself, the Duck Meatloaf was not well received.  Since I am a sucker for Belgian style ales, I thoroughly enjoyed a few glasses of the Ommegang Three Philosophers Quadrupel Ale :-)  I would definitely return for their dinner service!"
4710,"I wasn't too impressed after having this place on myList for so long. I finally moved to Brooklyn and was so excited to eat here and I was beyond underwhelmed. The vibe and the service are great don't get me wrong! I was just not that into the food and I really wanted to be. The chicken and pork were both dry and over cooked. Almost like they refried or over did it. Crispy for sure and very salty (and I like salty) but this was just too much. I almost thought it was a little burnt. Fries were yummy and the coleslaw was a waste of food on a plate. They gave us a lot, rather nice but honestly this side dish did not do anything to the dish. I would have rather had a spring salad or a refreshing side to counteract the grease from the fried entrees. It's all balance right? Please change this side. It's just a dead side tbh. I barely tasted the cheddar in the waffles which were also over cooked. Did I come on a bad day??? Tuesday lunchtime seems rather packed...I had a reservation. I walked away just utterly disappointed and unimpressed. What happened???"
4711,"One of the Friday evening , our friends and I decided to go that place. From the beginning to the end this place definitely deserve more than 5 stars. I really can't express my emotions on this review all the foods are soooooo amazing. I had buttermilk chicken and waffles. Omg! I still can't forget that jucy chicken. It was an enormous portion. It would definitely would be enough for two people. Coleslaw was so delicious because of the plate portion are so big, I would not be able to finish my entire meal. As a dessert I had a peach bread pudding. Oh gosh, can't wait to go back there."
4712,"This was such an amazing find! Have been here twice for Restaurant week and once for regular dinner. I think their dinner is better than brunch but I've only been here for brunch once. The butternut squash soup is so simple but so flavorful and has converted me to butternut squash. Their ricotta toast is such a tasty combination of crispy warm and soft cool. The toast and ricotta compliment each other so well and the cherry tomatoes are so refreshing and sweet. I generally don't like cherry tomatoes but theirs are really good. I normally don't like waffles and fried chicken but theirs is PHENOMONAL. Maybe it's the cheese in the waffles but I always get it now when I come here for dinner. The chicken is also well made - the skin is really crispy and chicken is tender and flavorful. The other items are good too like the salmon and the desserts, but the above are my favorite dishes and to go to. Highly recommend!"
4713,"Let's get straight to it: this was one of the BEST meals I have had in my LIFE. I think about this pork chop and cheddar waffles at *least* once a day everyday because it is just that good. My boyfriend and his parents had been hyping up Buttermilk Channel (and the pork chop and cheddar waffles specifically) to me for literal months and I finally got the chance to try it on father's day. Boy, not only did it live up to the hype, but it far exceeded my expectations. Pro Tip: if you like things spicy and sweet, I recommend asking for some hot sauce on the side. The pork chop was honestly so well seasoned and crispy that it didn't need any help, but with that combo of maple syrup and hot sauce? Oh my, I thought I died and went to heaven. I am admittedly not the biggest waffle fan (boo, U know I know), but I give these a 10/10! I was also encouraged to get a side of hash browns with my food. I never know what to expect when I order hash browns. Are they gonna be shaved potatoes? Home fries and not actually hash browns? You never really know. But these hash browns, straight from heaven. So crunchy on the outside and super soft on the inside, balanced with just enough salt. Another 10/10 from me! If you're still reading this review and not on your way to Buttermilk Channel, what are you waiting for??"
4714,"I have had dinner at Buttermilk Channel on three occasions, and the service and food were exceptional each time. I love this place, to be honest. The decor is simple but sharp. The atmosphere is warm, and there's a feeling of sophistication without pretentiousness. Servers and bartenders are highly attentive. Food deserves a new paragraph: Warm Lamb Salad is amazing, and for a salad kicks ass (any negative implication that comes with the word ""salad"" is forgotten when this dish comes out). The Duck Meatloaf? My cousin ordered it and didn't look up for twenty minutes (I've had it too and understand why). Pan-Roasted Steelhead Trout, which has a perfect balance of broth and texture, is delicious.I would strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone living in or visiting NYC. PS, it's in an amazing neighborhood."
4715,"Great brunch spot! I loved the fried pork chop with cheddar waffle. My friend had the chicken sandwich and another had the abc grilled cheese, all good!! Great coffee too."
4716,"This was one of those meals that left me wondering what in the world kept me from coming here sooner. This is the perfect date night spot - dimly lit classic space surrounded by flickering candle lights everywhere. Super cozy. The service was excellent - quick and friendly, but not overbearing.The food was just about perfect. The popovers were wonderful sticky from their honey coating, fluffy, and had just the right amount of crunch. Now $27 may seem expensive for a salad, but the warm lamb salad could be a filling meal on its own - generous portion of shredded lamb, soft boiled egg, and it wasn't lacking in the flavor department either. I also loved the decadent duck meatloaf - this ain't your standard run of the mill plain Jane meatloaf, seared foie gras is involved here. These three items were enough food for two people to end up with leftovers.If I were to complain about one thing, it would be that it was quite warm indoors. Could all the romantic candles be to blame?I can't wait to come back and check out Buttermilk Channel's brunch offerings. I've got my eye on their fried chicken and the pork chop. Oh and rumor has it that Beyoncé has been spotted here on numerous occasions so don't be a fool and do as Beyoncé does, always."
4717,Came on a snow day. Great service and food. The eggs were sooo good. Sticky bun was okay. I would stick to other menu options before that one.
4718,First time visiting for brunch & this gem did not disappoint. Brunch was amazing!  Start with the biscuits that are as good as they say! The fried chicken was cooked & flavored to perfection. Service was also great!
4719,"Most amazing dinner spot! The vibe is definitely there it's nice and dimmed in there the babyback ribs were phenomenal, it literally slid off that bone! The coleslaw definitely compliments the ribs and the fried chicken with waffles! The cheddar waffles definitely caught me off guard It was an interesting mix! Now the eggplant lasagna was superb! Each layer had the right amount of sauce and eggplant, definitely some crisp there which made it even better. I definitely will be going back to try their brunch!"
4720,"Enjoyed brunch at Buttermilk Channel on Saturday morning. A near perfect brunch, with great service, tasty drinks, and wonderful food.Quality: Buttermilk Channel is a fantastic brunch spot. Every element of the meal was exactly what you hope for. I am not usually a Bloody Mary person, but here it is not something you want to skip. Their Classic Bloody Mary with a pickle across the top is strong and spicy, just as advertised. For food I started with the Short Rib Hash, which was the weakest item, but still quite good. Sunny-side-up eggs on top of a mix of short rib, potatoes, and onions, with a side salad and toast. Next was the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich, and there is a reason why buttermilk is in the restaurant name. Whether you come for brunch, lunch, or dinner, this is not to be missed. For brunch it is on a roll served with coleslaw and pickles. Crispy, tender chicken, it may be a challenge to eat because of the size, but absolutely worth every bite. The last part of our meal, and the item that really puts the meal over the top, was the Pecan Pie French Toast. Impossible to put into words how tasty this item is. The french toast is extremely moist, coming out with a consistency closer to bread pudding. Then covered in toasted pecans and molasses, with a side of whipped cream, it is perfection.Quantity: Each dish we ordered was huge and filling, one item per person is more than adequate.Value: $11 for the Classic Bloody Mary. $18 for the Short Rib Hash. $18 for the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich. $15 for the Pecan Pie French Toast.Ambiance: Buttermilk Channel is located in the Carroll Gardens area of Brooklyn. It is a pretty large space on a street corner along Court Street. We ended up sitting outside along the side of the restaurant, under the cover of an umbrella. They also have a ton of seating inside, with a long bar area and lots of tables surrounding it. No music outside, but it was bumping inside.Crowd: Reservations are highly recommended for brunch, but they do have some tables for walk-ins. It is a good spot for couples, groups of friends, and families.Service: It was very busy for Saturday brunch, but they had plenty of staff to make sure things moved quickly and efficiently. Our waiter was extremely friendly and the food flew out to our table.Parking: Some street parking in the residential area."
4721,I was craving Popovers.  I couldnt find anyone local that had it.  Someone suggested ordering from Buttermilk Channel.  Im so glad I did.  Delivery was super quick and the popovers are fantastic.  I am looking forward to dining in the restaurant and trying some of the other wonderful items on the menu!
4722,"Popped in for a quick bite, and these were delicious! There was more but I forgot to take photos, smh...As it was quite busy outside we opted to eat inside and found it not fancy but serviceable. We were asked for proof of vaccination which we had at the ready but it was never checked. Service was a bit slow inside because of the bustle outside, but overall a nice experience."
4723,"We dropped by this afternoon for an outdoor dining brunch. What a pleasant experience!The hostess (I believe, Jen) was just about the friendliest most helpful front of staff I've spoken to. She was able to put our name down for 1.5hrs from when we dropped by, sat us in a sunny table we mentioned we liked, remembered we had gone to check out a new apartment. Really, she made our visit lovely.We had an aperol spritz, bloody Mary, buttermilk biscuits, fried chicken sandwich, pancakes, and the burger. Like the description warns, the Bloody Mary was strong and spicy. It might've been a litttle salty for me, but a complex and delicious drink. The buttermilk biscuits were, of course, amazing. The fried chicken sandwich was MASSIVE and I'd definitely recommend trying it. The buttermilk pancakes were also delish, but they were just slightly under in the center. It came with a nice portion of 3 large pancakes.We'll definitely be back to Buttermilk Channel!"
4724,"Came here on a chilly Saturday during opening time. I'd recommend making a reservation beforehand but all walk-ins were seated when we went recently. We got the side of waffles, Esposito's sausage scramble, and buttermilk pancakes, and black tea. The tea comes out hot in its own pot and was great to warm up and came out fairly quickly. The food came out maybe 15-20 minutes after we ordered. Service was nice and I had no complaints.Buttermilk pancakes were large and fluffy. They were definitely good, but I would actually try to get them as a side next time and opt for other main dishes. The cheddar waffles were a nice side to try and I liked that the cheddar flavor wasn't overpowering. The actual scrambled eggs were very tasty but I wish the portion was larger. I could have less of the salad, or different dressing. The hash brown was great, the seasoning and use of scallions (I think) was unique. I'd definitely come back to try other things like their fried chicken sandwich and fried pork chop, as well as their fixed price menu."
4725,"Still an amazing experience. I have been here twice since COVID (once we just couldn't bear the wait!) so first things first, if you are coming for brunch maybe come an hour before you are hungry. It is worth the wait. Because it is damn good! This time we waited an hour and 15 minutes, and killed time walking around the beautiful neighborhood. Host, runners and servers were friendly, hospitable and accommodating.This time instead of limiting myself to the brunch cocktail list, I chose one of the drinks from their regular menu. I started off with the Gin Rose cocktail which I loved. It was just slightly sweet. Then we went with old favorites, the buttermilk pancakes and veggie egg Scramble. The pancakes are a hearty serving of 3 pancakes. We practically finished them off. Food came quite swiftly.The eggs are always cooked perfectly with a generous amount of veggies. We got an extra hash brown because they are so perfectly lightly fried and crisp-too good to share! The salad is always lightly dressed with a dressing that has a lot of mustard seeds. They didn't rush us and our order was perfect. One of the top brunch spots in Brooklyn."
4726,staff was super friendly and food was amazing !! they have indoor and outdoor seating with parking around. for sure make a reservation. menu isn't too big but you must get the pork chop and cheddar waffle - i ate the WHOLE thing and everyone that tried some of my dish said they wish they got that cus it was so good. pork chop was crispy and so flavorful and cooked perfectly. so juicy. cheddar waffle tasted good with syrup but even better without in my opinion. also tried the warm lamb salad omg one of the best salads i've had. i love lamb and it was so tender and flavorful not gamy at all. we also got a side of bacon and hash browns. hash brown is a must !! deep fried crunchy goodness wish it was closer to where i lived would totally go often!
4727,"Buttermilk Channel is back and so are their brunch staples! Where else can you get fried pork chops with cheddar waffles, Pecan French toast a la mode w/ in-house made ice cream, or a buttermilk chicken sandwich so big you can barely get your mouth around it, all while soulful tunes playing in the background. The food is as delicious as I remembered it, the waitstaff was polite and there's seating both in and outdoors. Theres no unlimited option, but they do have a bar with brunch drinks, tea, coffee and hot chocolate. The wait to be seated may take up to 1hr 15min, but Buttermilk Channel is definitely a quality dining experience. I've been wanting to come by all pandemic, and now that I finally have they did not disappoint! If you're ok with missing out on a boozy brunch, but eating well, I definitely recommend Buttermilk Channel."
4728,Pecan Pie French Toast and Hot Sausage Scramble was everything my heart... I mean my stomach needed!
4729,"Five stars all around. Friendly and attentive service. Great food and such cozy atmosphere. We had lentil soup, Goddess salad, pecan sundae, and mashed potatoes. All were delish! We will be back."
4730,Fantastic spot. Walked by and tried it with a friend purely on chance. I had the duck meatloaf and he had the fried chicken. Literally everything was great. And the pecan pie sundae was *absolutely* worth the stomach ache for this lactose intolerant person.
4731,"This place was always so crowded in the weekend precovid and that happened for a reason. I brought my mom here for birthday celebration and we had a great brunch experience. I love their ambiance - simple and elegant. Service wise - top notch, my server was a sweet gentleman and gave my mom a complimentary dessert. Buttermilk Channel is well-known for their fried chicken and I was a bit disappointed that they didn't have that in the brunch menu. We ordered the following - Short Rib Hash, Warm Lamb Salad, a Short Stack of Pancake and a Side of Cheddar Waffle. Like I said my last visit was few years ago and I honestly don't remember the taste of each of those dishes but I still remember how good the Warm Lamb Salad was. First of all, I don't like lamb meat. Secondly, I have never tried warm salad before. BUT, this salad was exceptionally flavorful. GET THIS!"
4732,"Unfortunately, didn't even get as far as sit down, because we were ""greeted"" at the door by possibly the rudest Maitre'd/Host. Will very likely not come back.0 stars."
4733,"This place was a MAJOR MAJOR disappointment. The food is presented so nicely and certainly looks the part but the flavor is severely lacking. My sister and I ordered buttermilk pancakes and they were sloppy as hell, mushy even. I was like what the hell is this?! We also ordered the fried chicken sandwich that came with fries which we assumed would be delicious b/c the chicken was beautifully brown and crisp however, to our surprise it tasted like nothing, like there was no salt, no pepper, no seasoning whatsoever. That's not how you do a fried chicken sandwich. The owner and chef should be ashamed of themselves for serving some bootlegged chicken as such. We also had a side of bacon - 4 strips to be exact is a side priced at $8! Man I could buy a pack of bacon for $8 at the supermarket but I digress, considering it was the only tasty thing we had there. Even the drinks were lackluster. We had Bellinis and I was like wow this is crap. Moral of the story: don't go here b/c you'll end up leaving your tasteless food there, paying for shit that you didn't enjoy, and heading to another restaurant afterwards to eat some quality food with flavor. (My sis and I went to Han Dynasty @ City Point after. That place - I highly recommend. Buttermilk Channel - hell no! Good luck! Happy eating to you all!"
4734,"My friends always rave about this place but yet again I found the food to be subpar and the service a bit weak. We went for brunch the other day and the hostess said there was a 30 min wait and that we had to show proof of vaccination. Both requirements were fine with us but lucky enough we were told an outside table was available. I will add that the hostess gave off a cold vibe. How can you be a hostess without a smile or a warm greeting is beyond me. That in itself is a red flag.We sat and began sorting out the menus via QR code. I ordered the Fried Chicken Sandwich and my friends ordered some other dishes including the Waffle and Pork-chops. I will focus on my Sandwich. The crispness of the batter was no doubt beautifully done. As someone who cooks often, this was the highlight of the Sandwich. As for taste. I don't know if I got one that was marinated with the bottom of the batter but it was salty AF! So much so that I could not eat much of it or I would have my blood pressure through the roof. Not one to complain, I just rolled with it. The service was meh. I was offered a cup of coffee that the waiter said he had as extra - apparently he made too much. I am not sure if I got billed for it because by the time the bill came, I had enough. One waiter or busboy came by and asked if I needed a coffee refill or another cup. I happily responded, ""yes."" But he never showed up with the coffee. Overall, a very disappointing visit. I keep telling my friends who love this place that I don't see the reason why. A bunch of them are coming into town this week and will likely ask to go here. I will try and convince them otherwise or opt not to go when they do. Perhaps this place is a hit or miss?? I for sure with the few visits don't see the what's all the fuss about. Overrated in my opinion."
4735,"From now on everybody's gonna get five stars but let me tell you this:  Three of us were in the area at 2 o'clock on the Friday afternoon after thanksgiving and it turns out that's a perfect time to walk in to Buttermilk Channel with no reservation.  We were seated immediately, water brought and drinks ordered. The Sailors Knot was ""delicious and warming"" on that damp day and The Fair Harbor ""exquisite"". I had an iced tea cause I was driving.  One of us was ""kinda obsessed with"" the side of fries to the point the table shared a second order. Other notes the steak salad was ""cooked perfectly"" and the chicken sandwich tasty and satisfying--though I did make a bit of a mess of it. Luckily the restroom is decently sized and clean.   Staff was friendly and helpful. So there you go."
4736,"Went there for brunch. Food was delicious!! Suggest getting reservations to be safe and not have to wait. I got the ABC Grilled cheese and enjoyed it. Also if you're not allergic to walnuts, definitely get the walnut sticky bun!I'd definitely go back again next time I journey down to the Red Hook area."
4737,"Have been wanting to try this place forever and finally got a dinner reservation. Our table was a bit small and where we were located was a bit inconvenient (I was about an inch away from falling into the road and my gf was pinned up against an umbrella pole) but I wasn't gonna let that dampen the mood. Staff was also super friendly too which helped. We began with cocktails which were solid. Then started with the muscles which were good. Solid flavor, good portion and perfect bread for soaking up sauce. For mains we went with the duck meatloaf and their fried chicken. The fried chicken had the best crunch I've had on fried chicken. Super crispy outside and nice and juicy inside. The side of syrup adds an awesome complimentary flavor. The duck meatloaf was the star though. Incredible flavor and so tender. Comes with great mix of vegetables, would recommend again and again."
4738,"My second attempt to finally eat here was a success. I had a really good bloody mary to begin. I was torn in what to order but ended up getting the fried chicken sandwich with slaw and salad ( comes with shoe string fries by default) chicken was crispy and tasty. it comes with two pieces, which are too thick to stack on the sandwich so i had one on its own to taste and enjoy. Sandwich with the slaw and pickles was really yummy. My beauty had the scrambled eggs with spicy sausage which she loved. The eggs came with a salad and this really good hash brown. I want to go back to try the dinner."
4739,"Had an amazing brunch there!!! Make reservations! I had a vegetable omelette and my dining partners all had egg dishes or the fried chicken sandwiches which they thoroughly enjoyed.  We had to get a pancake ( you are at the Buttermilk channel, after all) and the restaurant obliged with a single large pancake we could all split together. This place fills up fast so make reservations and come early!."
4740,"I've been meaning to come here for so long, since Pre-COVID and I finally had the opportunity to! Even though the name of the restaurant has chicken in it, I ended up having eggs Benny. It was delicious though although it was very plain. Our waitress was extremely nice and offered super friendly service to us. It was a hot day so the drinks were cold and refreshing. I regret not having chicken, but that means I will be back then! :)"
4741,"This place is on so many brunch lists to lists where Beyonce and Jay-Z have eaten at, so you know you have to try it at some point in your NYC life!For brunch, I found the pork chop & cheddar waffles to be very good. However, the lox platter my friend got was just average.It's hard to have fair expectations for a place that is so hyped already, but I'd be open to coming back again!"
4742,"The pancakes here are clouds. Fluffy, airy puffs of dough with a sweet buttery  flavor. I knew the whole stack was too big for me, but the waitress let me just order one on the side. There was no extra  up charge for ordering just one pancake either! I always opt for more interesting dishes but this classic buttermilk pancake was so worth it!The fried pork chop with cheddar waffle is truly worth the hype. The pork chop is very salty, but it's just so juicy that it squirts a little when you cut into it. The saltiness complements the sweet syrup. Overall it's flavorful and tender, with strong flavors. I've never had a dish with this flavor palette before and it was worth the experience. The portion is huge so make sure you split it with your fam!Will definitely be  back next time I'm in the area. Make sure you come early because there can be a long wait on weekends"
4743,"This place is a real diamond in the rough. My wife Amy and our son and daughter were greeted with a warm welcome and seated immediately right in the middle of the dinner rush. Our son Tone was having a temper tantrum on account of a bad experience with his barber earlier in the day, but the jovial spirits or our hostess warmed him right up to a bright, bright September evening smile. We sat down in good spirits. All throughout dinner I couldn't help but think of what a clever name this place had and how it honored the great farmers throughout our history of Red Hook and Carroll Gardens. I had hoped it wasn't lost on some of the patrons... but I digress.We were immediately greeted by our server Julio, he was a gentle kind hearted man. We requested him, partially because a friend from the neighborhood had told us he was the greatest server they have had the pleasure of experiencing. He DEFINITELY  lived up to the hype. He was well dressed and kind and some folks around town say he has the smoothest skin in the business. He also kept the drinks coming... I don't think my beer mug emptied out all night!It was our daughter Tiffany's birthday, and we wanted to give her a really great experience...and boy did this place ever make her feel special. She kept me up half the night talking about it. Even my drunk uncle Duane, who is usually a public embarrassment and a nuisance was well behaved and humbled by the experience. As a side note, I'm a vegetarian and it should be noted that this place comes packed with some very special homemade veggie options... compliments to the chef for really knocking it out of the park with the veggie burg. It was to die for! Not some generic ""impossible"" something or other... this was the real deal. We don't get out much these days since I work for the city and put in long hours. The boss is really riding me, but I'm glad we decided to cut out some time to venture out to this place. Our kids Tone and Tiffany can't wait to go back. Julio and the whole team made our family feel so special. This restaurant now holds a very amazing and sentimental place in the hearts of all of my family. Thank you Buttermilk Channel. We can't wait to visit again!"
4744,"After years of having this on list of brunch spots to try in Brooklyn, I finally made it to BUttermilk Channel. I must say I that was not disappointed. I was immediately greeted when I walked in around noon. The place was packed already. I was given a 25-30 min estimate by the hostess then she took my name and number. I was shocked when less than 15 mins later I received a text saying my table was ready!The menu has very reasonable prices with dishes ranging from $15-$22. We were a bit disappointed when we were told they had sold out of biscuits, which was shocking since we were there fairly early. The waitress accommodated us by throwing in free coffee for my friend and pancake as a side for my Eggs Huntington. Towards the end of our meal she surprised us and said they were now back to serving the biscuits. They were worth the wait. Overall a great brunch experience. Hope to be back in the near future."
4745,Both of our dishes were absolutely amazing. The cocktails were delicious as well. The staff were all very kind and helpful. Been here several times and this is still an excellent restaurant.
4746,"You're always going to have a quality meal at Buttermilk Channel whether it be brunch, lunch or dinner. You'll pay a Brooklyn premium for it, but it's actually worth it. The food is always mouth watering no matter what you order (though the fries and popovers are TO DIE FOR). I'm also partial to their pickles (which they sell to go too). Drinks are well made, if not a little small on the pour/price ratio. Bonus on kids' meals are the clown sundae (upside down ice cream cone with ultra premium ice cream). Service is consistently friendly and upbeat (read no snobbery) and water is continually filled throughout your meal (extra helpful as fries can be salty). I'm so glad they've been able to stay in the hood for a long time as they're certainly a staple. If you haven't checked them out ever - what's wrong with you? If it's been a while, make it a point to head back while the outdoors are still perfect!"
4747,"Brunch at Buttermilk Channel absolutely did not disappoint! We started out with a Bellini and Aperol Spritz...I've had better but these did the job for brunch. My bf and I shared the Pecan Pie French toast and the Esposito's Hot Sausage Peppers & Onion Scramble as well as a side of bacon. The French toast is a MUST and reminded me of a bread pudding, soft and on the inside  but with a slight crispy edges. The fresh whipped cream and the bourbon molasses sauce really took it over the edge. The scramble was packed with flavor and had a really nice kick to it without being overpowering. It also came with a nice side salad and some awesome hash browns that weren't greasy. I do not recommend getting the side of bacon--it's pretty standard and thinly sliced: in my opinion, just not worth the $8. I would definitely come here again though!"
4748,"First off, buttermilk Channel has exceptional service! They made every effort to accommodate our request to sit outside in a specific area and even moved us to a table that was in the sun so we could be warmer. My party and I all split The biscuits which were truly exceptional and you can tell how well the dough was laminated and how many layers were in it. Certainly no shortage of butter used but it was worth it. The pancakes were also delicious but the real highlight was the massive chicken sandwich! I will definitely be back here when I am in the area."
4749,Great service and amazing menu! This restaurant is a plus for Carroll Gardens Brooklyn.
4750,Pretty sure the person who processed my card payment stole my card information to use at macys.com. Also the food was just okay and it was way too hot in there for them to not turn on the air conditioning.
4751,"This is such a gem: from the food, to the fare, to the fast and friendly service and affordability, nothing compared. Absolutely amazing and delicious"
4752,"Buttermilk Channel serves up an amazing brunch in Carroll Gardens. I got the fried pork chop and cheddar waffle. The fried pork chop was crispy, juicy, and flavorful and the cheddar waffle was sweet and slightly savory. The syrup complemented the salt on the pork chop. I wish their fried chicken and waffle was offered for brunch because I would've wanted to try that, but I'm glad I branched out and thoroughly enjoyed the pork chop! More food reviews on Instagram: @newyorkcityfoodie"
4753,Great dining experience! The mezcal and Negroni cocktails were both enjoyable. The mussels had a nice sauce but the mussels themselves were not super impressive. We ordered fries with them which was a nice pairing but it would have been better if they came with them since the bread was not very exciting. The chicken and waffles was very hyped up but did not disappoint. It was excellent in every way and extremely satisfying. Would love to check out their brunch menu. The waitress was friendly and helpful.
4754,"Have visited the Buttermilk Channel twice for brunch already and each time has been just as good. They don't take reservations on the weekend for brunch, so expect to wait between 30mins to 1hr depending on the time you get there. If it's a party of up to 2 people, maybe sitting at the bar might be a better idea as you end up waiting less time. If you choose to go that route, I recommend you Stand by the bar and be observant of who might be leaving next as the seats are on first come first serve basis and most people waiting will just grab them even if they came after you.Give it a try if you get a chance, definitely worth the wait. Food quality is delicious and service is really good despite of how busy they are."
4755,They used to do short stacks and tall stacks. Now they only do short stacks. Which is disappointing. The best pancakes in Brooklyn? Possibly. But the place is always  packed on weekends. You can wait up to 45 minutes for a table. So come as early as possible.
4756,Pricey but good  hostes  I like the hostess she was doing a nice job !!! Give it a try!!!!
4757,"Cute restaurant! It was very busy Sunday morning for brunch but our wait was only about 20-25 min for 5 people so not too bad! Very nice customer service we ordered coffee and lattes while we waited for our table. Our waitress was very sweet as well and attentive.We first ordered a Walnut Sticky Bun to share for the table and it was pretty good! Sweet, soft texture. For my meal, I ordered the roasted mushroom, and spinach scramble with cheddar cheese instead of goat cheese. The dish also came with a hash brown and side salad which I enjoyed. I also tried a piece of my friends Pecan Pie French Toast and it was so delicious! It was really creamy and sweet with a whipped cream topping. I was in the mood for something savory but if I wanted a sweet dish for brunch I definitely would've ordered it because it was so good!"
4758,"The food was lack luster it wasn't anything special but it wasn't bad. The prices are a little pricey as well. However the service there is terrible! We had a reservation at 2 and we got there around 1:45, the hostess told us to wait or to come back at 2. We specifically told her that we would just walk around the neighborhood until we can come back so we would not crowd the outdoor dinning. We walked away from her and she's yelled at us, chasing us a 1/4 down the block. She asked in a nasty attitude ""where do you think you're going? I told u the table isn't done yet? Who do u think u are?"" She thought that we were walking towards an empty free table. The hostess continued to stare down my party the whole time we ate and we just felt really uncomfortable. The waitress was sweet and made the experience better."
4759,"I came here at the suggestion of my date, who lives in the neighborhood and is a regular; she was showing me the best of what Carroll Gardens has to offer.  Not having a reservation, we left our names and went a few doors down to Travel Bar for a couple of cocktails and to kill forty minutes.On return, we had a table outside waiting for us  on an absolutely beautiful night for dining al fresco.  We started with a bottle of mid-table Syrah, and ordered a dozen of the barbecued oysters.  The fact that they brought the roasted ones went unmentioned to the waitress, because they were lovely, even if not what we ordered.  Spicy little bites of heaven.The server and my companion exchanged lots of friendly banter throughout the evening, and went out of her way to include me, which made me feel very much at home.  She approved of my choice of the duck meatloaf, and my dining partner ordered the flat iron steak.  For the uninitiated, I will tell you in advance: duck meatloaf has the taste and texture of any meatloaf.  It was a beautiful plate, albeit a small portion, and I was happy though unimpressed.  The side vegetables managed to take a starring role on the plate, and I was left wishing I'd ordered a side of whipped potatoes.  My friend seemed delighted with her steak, which she knew she would be in advance.Another bottle of wine later, and a couple of her friends sat down by chance at the table next to us.  There was now even more wine, which later turned from the aforementioned syrah into port and digestifs, and the evening went on for considerably longer than anticipated.  I had a wonderful time, but without mincing words, the company and locale exceeded the quality of the food.  The service was exceptional throughout, but I have no way of telling if that's the norm, or how three frequent visitors and their interloper are treated.  Regardless, I offer nothing but praise in that department.Had the meatloaf been nearly as life changing as promised, and had the oysters been the ones we ordered, I would have no problem offering five stars for this dining experience.  The food on this visit, however, didn't stack up against the reputation of the restaurant, though the vibe and scene aspects most assuredly did.I would certainly return, but it's somewhat telling that in the six months since, I have yet to do so."
4760,"This place has been on my list forever, and now that I finally went, I will definitely be going back.We came from brunch on Saturday. We had a reservation (made it on Seated to get the rewards cash) and only had to wait a few minutes for our table.  The place was fairly busy and loud, but I wasn't exactly looking for a quiet brunch anyway. Some of us ordered bottomless mimosas ($18) and they include good flavors. My sister and I spilt the Brioche French Toast ($15) and the Banh Xeo ($16). The french toast was some of the best french toast I've ever had.  It was pretty much a dessert with the caramel and coconut whipped cream and was super delicious. It was actually a little spicy, which I loved. I would also definitely recommend the Banh Xeo. I'd never really had a savory crepe like that before and it was great. We also all shared the Powdered sugar donuts ($8), which were good, but if you're looking to share something sweet, I'd go with the French Toast.Our waitress was super nice, the place looked cool inside, and overall it was a great time. I'll definitely be back and I can't wait to also try their new sister restaurant (Piggyback)."
4761,I went here for bottomless brunch and it was SO GOOD. They restrict you to 1.5 hour and they really keep track and cut you off when it's over unfortunately. They have fun flavors but the champagne to juice ratio is quite large and you can't really taste the flavors. I got the sizzling sisig with a side of garlic fried rice and it was delicious! I love that this place has brunch items that aren't just eggs. The sisig was so savory and had great flavor along with the rice. Would highly recommend!
4762,"EXCELLENT experience, food and drinks. Overall a good time with attentive staff. Our table ordered multiple items to share + the bottomless mimosa brunch. As other posts have mentioned, the lychee is indeed always unavailable. The sisig and garlic rice was my favorite combo. The banh xeo and powdered donuts were A+ as well. Noodles were delicious and easy to share.Overally, highly recommend as it's a good time for brunch!"
4763,"Made a reservation for a weeknight dinner for a table for two. The restaurant was quite loud, which made it hard to maintain a conversation. We ordered the pork belly adobo and khao soi, with a side of coconut rice and jasmine rice. These two dishes both fell under the small plates category, but they were extremely different sizes even though they were around the same price point. The pork belly was okay, it came with a poached egg but it wasn't my favorite. I was excited to try the khao soi. The egg noodles were good, but I felt that the dish was lacking a bit in the amount of meat given. The fried egg noodles were a nice crunch at first, but they quickly became soggy after the whole dish was mixed together"
4764,I don't believe this place has authentic Filipino or Thai cuisine. The food was extremely underwhelming and I would not recommend this place to others or come back. I had a bad first impression off the bat when the music was so loud that the waiter serving us had to take his mask off to speak to us so that we could read his lips. There was no point of him wearing the mask if he was just going to bring it to his chin to speak with us.The food was subpar and overpriced for what it was.- Sizzling Sisig: salt was too powerful. - Pork Belly Adobo: came with maybe 5-6 pieces of meat. It was alright but for $17? Not worth it- Pad Cheong See Ew: it came with maybe 10 noodles max. The food to plate ratio was off by a lot- BBQ Baby Back Ribs: nothing special- Half Hainanese Duck: Was surprised to see Hainanese duck on the menu of a Filipino/Thai place. The duck fat rice was so hard and basically inedible. The duck was pretty good though but came with a lot of fat.
4765,"This place!!!! You may walk past it and miss it but you don't want to miss out on this flavorful food. Drinks were good. Everything was delicious. We shared Brussel sprouts, the shrimp and okra small plate, red curry chicken, whole fried fish and baby back ribs. This is what NY is about! Small business owners with the best food!  No chain restaurants but chefs who do it for the love of it all.Go here! It's not fancy but who cares?"
4766,"We had fun at pig and khao!I have been bookmarked this place for almost two years but never got a proper accompany to go with. Finally, I got opportunity to come here and it definitely didn't disappoint me at all. Place is tiny with great vibe. Food is tasty- had all their signature dishes. Curry is on point, pork head is juicy and coconut rice elevated the whole dinner. I don't know if they are just good or we are good at ordering food. ( I think it would be the first one)Service: damn. I hate to say LES has some dope waiters/ waitress. They chill, they don't rush, they don't give u the peak when you are still hesitating on what you wanna order. They just gave u space. Hands up for the great service!Overall: 4 stars. Come enjoy some great south Asian food."
4767,"A good bottomless brunch option! Food selection is good, but not many meatless entree options. That said, there are a couple meals that they can make vegetarian by substituting tofu. I got the curry with tofu and it was pretty good."
4768,"Great spot for Southeast Asian food with a chill, hip vibe! Get:- Hainanese Duck ($42): this was so tender it was almost like pork, tasted nothing like other things I've had- Khao Soi ($18): great for curry lovers, comes with egg noodles, chicken, and crispy noodles on topPros:- Good vibes, super casual and hip, definitely more suitable for a younger crowd- Very homey, delicious food, especially the duck that is one of the better SE asian restaurants I've been to (I also like Laut)- Great service :) had multiple people come and check on us the whole time and my water was always fullCons:- We came for restaurant week but on Saturday they weren't doing it for some reason, which I wish I had known in advance but they didn't have it written on their website or when I made the reservation- Sisig was too salty but if you like pork head, you should get this!- Halo halo was interesting but had too much going on, with ube ice cream, shaved ice, rice krispies, flan, and other assorted desserts inside"
4769,"Pig and Khao is owned by Top Chef contestant Leah Cohen, and it's a fantastic Southeast restaurant in the Lower East Side. The three of us split three brunch small plates. Sizzling Sisig - One of their signature dishes; the sisig came on a flat pan with minced pork head and topped with a sunny-side up egg.Khao Soi - Thai noodle dish made with red curry, coconut milk, dark meat chicken, and topped with fried egg noodles. Afterwards, we ordered extra rice to soak up the remaining sauce.Powdered Sugar Donuts - Fried mantou-like bread with a dish of pandan condensed milk."
4770,"So good to see Filipino restaurants back and thriving in the city. Was intrigued since it was Fusion Thai - Filipino. Been for dinner and this was my first brunch here. Got the Green Papaya Salad - refreshing, crunchy and not soggy. For vegetarians, they can do tofu instead of chicken. Boy got the Khao Soi (red curry with chicken) - so flavorful and spicy! Shared the fried brussel sprouts which were perfectly crunchy and tasty with an Asian twist. Mimosas w lychee and mango and other tropical fruits available. Very LES street vibe with tons of old school hip hop booming too. The outdoor seating made me feel like we could be in Thailand. Enjoy!"
4771,"My NYC restaurant week adventures took me to Pig and Khao on Friday night. The freezing rain couldn't stop me from heading to LES for some Filipino cuisine, which I don't have too much experience with. I'm happy to say the food was the best thing I've tasted in a while and the flavors were so unique, yet reminded me of home. The Philippines and my native Dominican Republic have a common colonizer (the Spanish), so some of the ingredients are the same, but different flavors. We decided to pick items we didn't know from the menu and test our luck. For our appetizers we got fried Brussels sprouts and Tom Kha, which is a sour, lemony coconut milk soup. It was a little too sour for my tastebuds but Adriana loved it. Next, and my favorite was the pork belly adobo. Reminded me of chicharron, the juicy, tender porkbelly and crunchy pork skin in a delicious almost Japanese curry-like sauce was the highlight of my meal. I enjoyed this with coconut rice. Then, we had the Gai Yang, which was grilled chicken leg with a corn salsa and spicy sauce that had the perfect char and tasted like it was right off the grill at a BBQ. I had the vegetable curry option, which was a delicious soup with crunchy bean sprouts and tiny pieces of blended coconut. Finally, we had halo-halo for dessert which I LOVED. It's shaved ice with condensed milk topped with Ube icecream, pieces of flan, banana, and soft coconut strips. I LOVED IT. Perfect way to end my meal with such a creative dessert. At $59 per person it was on the pricier side but this was a 4 course meal, so plentyyyy of food and the flavors are so worth it. Please check this out if you want to try something delicious and well-seasoned, while deviating from more mainstream dining options. 4 stars because the service was very slow."
4772,The sisig is amazing (fatty & full of flavor) and goes great with rice. The chili pan mee was good but definitely is on the spicy side. The heat really creeps up on you. We were seated outdoors and the outdoor seating had a funky smell and lots of flies. I would recommend getting a reservation for indoor seating.
4773,"I've be been to Pig and Khao twice now, and both times I had a really positive experience. Food is great and they're very flexible in customizing if required (I don't eat meat and they left it out of a few dishes). The papaya salad is great. I also really liked their take on pad see ew (the noodles are the best I've ever had, and I eat Thai food by-weekly). The whole fried fish, coconut rice, and garlic rice are also excellent. I didn't love the khao soi, but I think that's just a flavor profile thing. Others in my group really enjoyed it. I think it's one of their more popular dishes. All in all, a nice option for dinner or brunch. Oh the only thing that I wasn't into is that they play music very loudly. Especially during dinner. I guess that's just the vibe, but I'm not super into it. I have these earplugs that lower volume by decibel without muffling sound, so if I go again I'll probably wear those . Be warned."
4774,Returned for for brunch on Father's Day and had another great experience. I tried:+ Spicy pakwan cocktail+ Rum & Hyde cocktail + Longonissa sausage + Sizzling sisig+ Fried brussels+ Garlic fried rice + Doughnuts with pandan custardWill be back again and again!!
4775,"This this place place!!!! Yes is a bit pricy and yes is Always packed!! Because well is beyond amazing and frankly one of the best one in the area.. now for nyc that's a lot... couple of friends and I went and man how great this food is..  ordered sizzling beef hash, baby back ribs, steak and eggs, the duck, and coconut rice out of all these amazing the coconut rice is the best I had, it was so great that one time I bought 5 sides orders and froze it at home. So while is a little harder now to get a reservation now because of covid it is absolutely worth it. So check it out!"
4776,"I hate Pig and Khao because they've ruined every Thai place I've ever eaten at ever. I hate that they're only in New York. I hate that we got there a little late and only had a chance to have these three dishes. Their  sauces/broth were so bomb. The rolled noodles for the Pad Cheong See Ew made me feel like I was eating scallops. The dilis (dried anchovies) with the Chili Pan Mee added that salty crunch/chew that added a touch to the creaminess that the egg yolk created. If you are ever vacationing in NY, get your ass over here. If you're a local make your out of state friends jealous by sending them photos of you eating food they'll crave when they ask to stay with you when they're in town."
4777,"This place is AMAZING. This is the kind of place that reminds me why I love NYC so much. It is not very assuming from the outside and pretty casual on the inside, but omg the food is out of this world.  It's all so so flavorful!!!! You must get the fried Brussels and the duck. They were crispy and so good. The khaki soi was a curry like dish with noodles and has a pretty big kick to it. Even though I don't like spice I was able to deal with it. I will definitely be coming back to try the rest of the menu."
4778,"Came here for Sunday brunch as a group of 7. We had a reservation for 6 ppl and they were kind enough to let us squeeze an extra person in. That being said, even if we only had 6 ppl, the space was very crampedMimosas Pro: not everyone has to partake in bottomless mimosas. they allow some to buy single drinks or not drink at all. bottomless is $18 vs a single mimosa is $11Cons: we had to work hard to flag down servers to refill our mimosas. I was really looking forward to the lychee mimosa but they ran out so had to stick with oj, mango, and peach. Food Pro: longanisa sausage and garlic rice was tasty Cons: portions were on the small side for price. Khao soi tasted ok in its own right but tastes so different than actual khao soi that I would not call it khao soi. I wouldve called it house yellow curry or something else. Sisig was very salty"
4779,Great spot for bottomless brunch. The mimosas keep coming...and its only $18 (for 1.5 or so hours)! Food is on the salty side but decent Thai-based food. The Sweet and Salty Cilantro Soda is VERY unique hahahaha the waiters are super chill and nice - was even willing to switch out or comp my sweet and salty cilantro soda if I didn't like it.
4780,"I typically come here for brunch and their mimosas; but I was in the area last night with a few friends and decided to come here to try their dinner menu as they've never failed to deliver amazing food. The restaurant is really popular for brunch and usually requires a reservation or a long wait but dinner on a weekday isn't too busy. We were seated immediately. The first thing you'll notice is how loud the music is. We had to practically scream the entire night and by the end of the night some of us lost our voices. The seats are also super cramped, it was hard to get into our seats and hard to move around. So just a heads up if you plan to come with a large group.As for food we ordered the:- Pad Ka Prow (5/5) This was extremely flavorful and really spicy! You can see all the thai chilies they used in this dish but it tasted amazing with the coconut rice. The rice is not included which I find a little insane for the fact that this is a family style restaurant. On top of that the rice was 4$ a bowl... maybe sneak in your own rice. -Grilled Sirloin (5/5) This was also very good the sauce they served it with was tangy and tasted amazing wrapped in the lettuce. The meat was very tender and was flavorful in its own without the sauce they included for dipping-BBQ Baby Back Ribs (4/5)The ribs were good but it tasted slightly burnt making it pretty bitter. The flavor was intense and very good; must get rice to balance out the strong flavors. Overall the good was delicious and for the taste of food alone we would come back. However the price of the food went up, amount went down, and then on-top of that they included a 10% covid fee. Wish there was a bit of transparency prior to dining in. 4$ bowl of rice is insane in my opinion, but it is the city so these crazy prices are expected. Just be warned with the price adjustments and the 10% covid fee for anyone dining. Though the fee won't deter me from returning but for anyone else that dine here may want to look elsewhere because they don't let you know until after you've finished."
4781,"My husband & I went on a Thursday evening and it was packed.  We were greeted at the door promptly, asked for proof of vax, and seated to a small 2 top.  P&K is a small restaurant and tight seating.  So tight where they have to move the table out for you to squeeze in.  Fine pre-pandemic, but slightly surprised.  It wasn't too uncomfortable for us, we could've left, but they do check vax status and the staff all wore masks.  Besides the food smelled amazing and we were excited to try it out.  Being Filipino, I wanted to try everything on the menu.  We had a great time with their specialty cocktails and their wonderful Filipino fusion food.  The flavors, spiciness, the atmosphere, the vibe were all fantastic.  We thoroughly enjoyed our experience!"
4782,"Visiting NYC for my birthday and staying around the lower east side. We didn't have dinner plans yesterday but saw Pig & Khao had plenty reservations for late dinner. Tbh I went in with zero expectations since I wasn't ecstatic with season 5...IT ROCKED MY WORLD!!We had Ka Prow (2nd photo) which was stir fried beef with Thai basil and fried eggs. It had quite the kick and my tongue was on fire lol but could not put it down! Then came the Pork Adobo (3rd photo). It's the kind of dish that makes you make happy noises. My husband couldn't stop laughing but damn that was real good. Probably the highlight of the night. Finally ended with the BBQ ribs (1st photo). They were so rich, sticky and fall of the bone tender. It's perfect with the acidic slaw to cut that sauce! Anyways sorry for the horrible photos. Once we started eating it was hard to take decent photos since I was so excited. It's a must visit in my books!"
4783,"I went for a birthday brunch. I was very disappointed in the lychee and mango mimosas as that was one of the main reasons we went. However, the peach was surprisingly really good.My khao soi was delicious, but wished there were more noodles because I just ended up with alot of crispy wonton noodles on top. My friend liked her xanh beo alot. I tried my other friends sisig and it was EXTREMELY salty that it was hardly edible without some rice to go with it. Service was quick and friendly and the interior was cute. I think I would come back to eat the crepe though."
4784,One of my absolute favorite restaurants in the neighborhood. Every single dish I've tried here is completely PACKED with flavor. You really can't go wrong. I always like sitting at the bar if possible to watch the chefs in action. The broth that comes with pork belly adobo is spectacular.
4785,"Pig and Khao has a limited menu, but we enjoyed everything we ordered! Ordering family style is definitely the way to go. Of what we ordered, the Brussel Sprouts and the Papaya Salad (super refreshing) were my favorite. The service was also wonderful. Would recommend stopping by if you're in the mood for some good Asian fusion food!"
4786,"I've been fortunate enough to visit Pig and Khao a couple times. The staff has always been accommodating - even during these crazy covid times, when outside seating is at a premium (and fairly limited) - and the service has generally been timely. As others have mentioned, outside dining recently has felt very reminiscent of a SE Asia food stall-type setup. After really minimizing my travel to NYC during this pandemic though, I was seriously missing this place and couldn't contain my craving for some of their khao soi. Thankfully, Pig and Khao is now shipping nationwide with Goldbelly! While I'd rather buy from restaurants directly, I couldn't turn down the opportunity to order from Pig and Khao and have my order shipped right to my doorstep. I recently order the 'Southeast Asian Classics Kit for 2' in order to appease both my green papaya salad and my khao soi cravings. The delivery was shipped and delivered on time, everything was wonderfully prepared (individually labeled, an instruction sheet on how to mix things together, and so on), and the quality of the ingredients was top notch. I'll be making a return visit once visiting NYC again feels more comfortable; in the meantime, I'm grateful to be able to order this deliciousness and have it delivered so quickly to where I'm holed up during this pandemic. Thank you, Pig and Khao peeps!"
4787,"I really appreciated how unique this place was. Love the decor and the intent of the menu, but the food was okay. I came for Sunday brunch with my friends and ordered the chili pan mee, banh xeo, and khao soi. The chili pan mee was hands down the best dish. The anchovies really added a nice umami to the dish. The khao soi was fine, could have used more salt but still enjoyable. The one dish that offended me as a Vietnamese American was the banh xeo. Not only was it thick and not crispy, but it was filled with non authentic fillings. I'm all for putting your own spin on a classic, but if you're going to charge me $16 for it, please make it good. Don't charge $16 for something you can't execute well. Also, they spelled nuoc cham incorrectly on the menu. It is spelled ""cham"" with an ""a"" not ""chom""."
4788,"Came on Saturday and was served very quickly! They do an hour and a half bottomless mimosas  for 18 bucks and entrees were very affordable as well! They have mango, peach, lychee, and orange mimosas and they were delicious. Who doesn't love mimosas with noodles? Our waitress (female waitress on Saturday) was so nice and helpful with food recommendations. Definitely will be coming back and recommend everyone does as well"
4789,"This was probably one of my least favorite restaurants during my stay. We made reservations in advance and were seated at the bar; a view of the kitchen madness. I came for the Khao Soi, the noodles in a curry sauce, which was decent. I found it to be overwhelming. Not only the taste, but the wait to receive food. The kitchen was super tiny so kudos to the folks inside prepping meals. It seemed like they were making 1-2 dishes in bulk at a time. We order quite a few dishes but it never looked like our other dish was being made. We asked for our check after the Khao Soi and brussel sprouts and were on our way out."
4790,Dope spot.  Their food is delicious.  SO GOOD!  The bacon app was awesome and I loved the ribs.  The drinks were pretty good and the service was excellent.  Only thing is you will smell like food most likely going there because it's an open kitchen so be wary of what you're wearing.  That does not take away from the experience though.  Can't wait to go back.
4791,"I'm actually writing this review based on the goldbelly delivery received. Got a mix of brunch items and dinner items, most of which are menu items you can get at their flagship store, but goldbelly ships it to your home so you can get a taste of their cuisine.First tried the salad dishes - a basic tomato and cucumber salad with fish-sauce infused dressing, and accompanied by four link sausages. They were so delicious - as usual for restaurants in general a bit salty but such nice flavorings. Also impressive was the papaya salad, accompanied by a spicier dresssing, and dried taro chips, dried scallions. I don't usually like salads, but I liked these two!The fried rice was absolutely amazing - a shrimp paste rice. This wasn't too salty, but you could tell that the flavoring was rich with a tinge of fermented seafood flavor.Also clever was the jasmine rice mixed with coconut milk. What I liked about the goldbelly delivery was that it gives you an opportunity to dissect a meal by having to combine the ingredients yourself. The coconut milk flavor was a bit too sweet for my taste, but I was still impressed with the innovative (to my palate) flavoring.One of the meat dishes was a corned beef hash with potatoes, accompanied by shallots, garlic, ginger. Here the dish was definitely too salty, esp. given that you were to add fish sauce at the end. It's also tricky to not overcook the alliums. It's amazing that everything is prepped so nicely though - that much is appreciated.The sisig, which is pan-fried sizzling pork bits (including a bit of pig ear and other parts) were really delicious - they sizzle to a crisp, contain a variety of textures, and are accompanied by a fish sauce, infused with garlic, ginger, and keffir lime leaf topped with cilantro. I was suitably impressed, though I advise getting a paper towel to soak up some of the extra grease!!The brioche toast with kaya jam was amazing. Note that kaya jam is cream-colored (labelling would have helped!). The bread was a bit too sweet for me, but otherwise I found the flavoring intriguing.The khao soi noodle soup, essentially a chicken noodle soup using a thick curry-like broth, was also good, also a bit too salty. This version uses fried noodle strips, raw onion, and preserved veggies on top of the noodles swimming in broth, with some nicely tender boneless thigh chicken bits.The Thai rice krispie treats were nicely delicate, yet reminiscent of our perennial childhood favorite.In summary a really neat experience!"
4792,"I really wanted to like this place but pork belly should be 50% fat 50% meat, these pieces where 100% fat 5 of the 8 pieces and the other 2 where 10% meat 80%, I think a lot before complaining because I did not want to have a worse time that I was already experience, but a really nice server saw my face and came to me and ask me if everything was ok, I told him and a he sent some one else also really nice that offer us another plate, but I was already in a bad mood, feeling little sick to my stomach, I just wanted to go home. So I say no, and he bring the check and give us 50% on that plate, I think that was ok, but this issue make me feel very uncomfortable."
4793,"This restaurant reminds me of the days in Singapore. The Khao Soi tasted like a combination of Laksa and Tong Yum, with two types of noodles, boiled and crispy egg noodles. I love the blended flavor of the curry, satay and lime. The environment was a bit similar to the street food in Southeast Asia. One reminder is that don't eat Khao Soi with white top... it's very likely you'll spilt something on it and would be hard to wash off (which was what happened to me)."
4794,@pigandkhao didn't fail me. I had fallen in love with you a long time ago. When I discovered #khoasoi and the fact that you served it I knew we needed to meet. It was incredibly full of flavors heavy in lemon grass and love following a welcomed mild burn to then conforming into a creamy sweetness as it's final form. The restaurant it's self was warm and alluring just like all the other things offered on their menu. I'd highly recommend getting their #brusselsprouts and coconut rice as well and finish with their #ricotta #donutholes with a #calamansi dipping sauce. For those of you that don't know what that is think of yuzu meets an orange. It's a cute little citrus fruit commonly grown in the Philippines. Anywho they have an open kitchen so you can awkwardly oooo and ahhh while you stalk your food gods making your meal. Enjoy!IG: @smokedsage
4795,Cool vibe. Friendly service. They were playing some 90s hip hop so that was a plus. Sisig was good but a little to spicy for my taste. Definitely try the pork belly adobo. Wish they had lechón on the menu though
4796,"Cool & unique brunch spot for sure. Had reservations here on a Saturday afternoon and was not too busy, luckily. This place has been on my list for some time and always had timing/capacity issues with getting a table during brunch. FAMILY style brunch. -- Steak and Eggs ($19): grilled flank, fried egg, spicy issan sauce-- Chili Pan Mee ($18): ground pork, ramen noodles, crispy anchovies, slow poached egg-- Sizzling Sisig ($18): pork head, chili, whole egg All were pretty good. Small portions though and a bit on the salty side. Bit pricey for the portions IMO. First time that I can recall having a Filipino cuisine, so definitely good first experience. Lastly, topped off the brunch with bottomless mimosas obviously (orange, lychee, mango and peach). Honestly, all the flavors tasted the same.. They were all quite carbonated via champagne, but very difficult to decipher the differences in taste."
4797,"When I heard this restaurant belonged to one of my favorite Top Chef contestants Leah Cohen, I knew I had to give it a try. Even with all the Top Chef hype I have to say I was beyond pleased. Both the Khao Soi and Duck were beyond standouts, and I'm now Itching to comeback to try more. Do yourself a favor and give this place a go!"
4798,1.Halo-Halo $10 Favorite dish!2.Half Hainanese Duck $35Favorite entree!3.Sizzling Sisig $18 Excellent!4.BBQ Baby Back Ribs $27Excellent!
4799,"The foods were too salty for our group's taste and we were disappointed that there was a limited menu for dessert. We came to try their ube dessert but was told that was not available. When we asked if it's possible to just order the Ube icecream, again we were told it's not possible. The service was great and brunch bottomless was great value but I do not think our group will want to come back."
4800,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon with some friends and the place was packed! Definitely try to make a reservation beforehand. We were seated at one of the private booths but they also have longer shared tables and outdoor seating (no heaters though).We got the 6-piece chicken tatsuta appetizer to share. They were big pieces but I thought this dish was just okay. Chicken wasn't super seasoned but the sauce had a nice tang and spice. I ordered the gyunan udon, which had a large portion of beef in it. In general, their portions are very generous! None of us could finish all of our broth. The actual udon was delicious with a nice chew. The beef was nothing special to me but it reminded me of pho haha. If I were to return I would definitely try one of their cold udon dishes to really let the texture of the udon noodles shine."
4801,"This is a well-known place for udon in NY. If you plan on checking this place out, I suggest making a reservation beforehand as the wait time can be long if you do walk in during prime lunch/dinner time! I think this place has the BEST noodles I ever had in an udon. They are so chewy and soft, like, you really have to try them. They give a decent amount of meat and veggies, so there is a good balance with those long, chewy noodles. The broth really depends on which udon you get, and I think whether you like it or not is just personal preference. The prices are pretty reasonable for a hot place in NY, but the portion is a bit small, so I suggest ordering some appetizers on the side! The service depends on if they're really busy or not, but usually they are still attentive and check up on you here and there. They did not have some of the drinks we wanted, but that could have been just on the day that my friend and I went. I never sat inside, as I always ate in the outdoor seating area, but outdoor actually has a lot of seating. When you get your check, they give a frozen grape per person, which is pretty cute and refreshing! Tip: East Village is cash only, but this Soho location accepts card!"
4802,"We were just here again.  I guess we really like it.  This time we again had Chawanmushi with uni but we also had some shrimp tempura, an unusual eggplant dish that was very good (we have not had this before), beef udon (which we wanted to try this time) and fried chicken with special mayo sauce.Everything was very good!  I highly recommend this place.  And the price is right!"
4803,"I normally frequent the other Raku location, but stopped here for dinner as I was in the area.As always, the karaage was the best!! Of all the restaurants I've been to, Raku's karaage is unbeatable. I'm a huge fan of the lemon pairing with the perfectly crispy (but not too crispy) chicken.I usually get udon here but decided to try out the katsudon which was AMAZING. I noticed that most Japanese restaurants tend to have very mid katsudon; it's not something you can really mess but they never tend to be anything particularly special. However, Raku's katsudon had so much flavorful sauce and overall it was just a really well made dish. I do wish that there was a bit more chicken though."
4804,"TLDR: Absolutely delicious udon...arguably some of the best udon I've ever had. Come here during lunch hours or make a reservation to avoid long lines.Food: 9/10This udon really blew me away! I got the classic spicy beef udon (niku udon) and everything about it was divine. The broth was flavorful and meaty; this was one of the rare times I finished all the broth. The noodles were the star of the show! They were perfectly chewy and I can honestly say that was the best udon I've ever had.Price & Portion: 7/10Very standard pricing for New York. It was about $18 for a dish and the portions are large. They're not as big as Tsurutonton bowls (which is hard to beat), but with the quality, the portions are plenty to fill you up.Service: 7/10I can here during lunch, so I was seated immediately! The waitstaff were attentive and after your meal, you even get a frozen grape! Overall, no complaints here.Ambience: 7/10A very cute spot that transports you to Japan! The interior is well decorated and at least during lunch hours, it was well lit. There's a small section for outdoor seating as well."
4805,One of my favorite udon places in NY! The shape and texture of the noodles is always perfect. They have very simple options which took me some time to get used to but now I prefer less things in my udon! There is always a line and reservations book up. I did notice during midday it was less crowded. Definitely worth a visit.
4806,"Made a 3:30 reservation on a Saturday and despite the obscure time this place was packed and booming. All of their hot ramens sounded amazing but went with the short rib and the fried chicken and both were incredible. The karage was some of the best I've ever had, it was so juicy and the aioli it came with was awesome. I tried the cold udon for fun and it wasn't as good as I thought. That said everything else was incredible and thus 4 stars and def going back.TLDR: hot ramens incredible, fried chicken and short rib. Karage amazing. Cold udon just ok. Place packed even at 3:30pm. Go here."
4807,"There aren't too many udon spots that are popular in NYC and this was one of the most highly raved spots so I had to try it out. Unfortunately, I wasn't blown away and just found it to be just a decent spot.Definitely expect a wait if you're planning to come! I came for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and had to wait 1.5 hours before I was able to be seated, and this is just for a part of 2. It's not terribly small inside but also not that big either. We opted for indoor seating since it was starting to get chilly which is probably why we had to wait a bit longer. There is an outdoor dining area but there aren't any heat lamps. There are some individual tables but we ended up being placed at a long table where we were told to sit across from each other and they placed other parties of 2 right beside us. It wasn't an issue but if you prefer more privacy, you'd likely have to request for it. They also check vaccine cards with IDs before entering. We got the washugyu tataki to start as an appetizer along with our udons - kani ankake udon and curry udon. The washugyu tataki was very smooth and the small toppings they provide on top didn't really add much to it. The kani ankake is very similar to a egg drop soup / Chinese crab meat fish maw soup. It's very thick and definitely on the heavier side but good for a cold day cause it was piping hot and maintained its heat throughout the meal. However, the flavor wasn't hitting it for me and I personally don't really prefer those Chinese soups. There also wasn't much crab in it but I do like the addition of the seaweed! The curry udon was also a thicker soup as expected and flavor was alright.Now for the udon - it didn't taste fresh and although it was chewy, it wasn't the best udon I've had (comparing to fresh udon). It still felt a bit dense so the texture just wasn't there for me. They definitely do give a lot though, and a lot of broth as well so expect a filling meal! We also got the iced yuzu ginger tea that was very refreshing! Very light hints of yuzu and ginger so it went down smoothly but you still feel the kick of the ginger.Overall, a decent spot to check out for satisfying any udon cravings. There's a good variety of flavors to choose from. I'd probably recommend a lighter broth and have heard great things about the niku udon so would try that instead if I came back. Definitely a filling meal but expect a long wait."
4808,"Finally got to try the pressed sushi. Yum! And even though this is primarily an udon restaurant, their katsu don is pretty dang good. Simple goodness, everything I want out of an izakaya. 1. Sabazushi (seven mackerel pressed sushi) $182. Katsu Don (deep fried japanese corn-fed pork cutlet, egg rice bowl) $183. Karaage Fried Chicken"
4809,"Worth it? YesRepeat? KindaThe lines get loooong so prepare to wait. Is it worth the wait? Yes if you are a first timer. Repeat... kinda?Full disclosure: I love Udon. Therefore I love Raku. The East Village location captured my heart and we've been coming every NYC visit.This was the first time in this location... it's a little off the path but the wait line is still mmense. This location is slightly bigger but sitting in the middle communal table in front of a busy kitchen does get you bumps in the chair.Kaarage is always solidThe Kani Ankake was very unique... like a thick egg drop soup. Very rich and flavorful but the noodle texture suffered as the soup was piping hot. The Uni Ikura Don was good.. but at $38... it was not worth it from a portion and taste perspective.+Tan Tan yummy+Curry yummy+ Yamakake LOVEThese are the solid,  never fail options."
4810,"Raku specializes in udon bowls and japanese plates! This is the Sansai Udon, with noodles, mountain vegetables, and a tempura shitake mushroom  and on the left side is the Yaki Nasu, a deep-fried eggplant appetizer with braised pork and a quail egg Loved the atmosphere, and this was some super great udon! Make a reservation though - this place is always busy (as it should be)!"
4811,I literally just realized that I have no pictures of the udon! (probably bc I gulf it down as soon as it comes). I would say I prefer this location over the 6th st one because it has more seating (but expect a wait for sure).Their handpulled noodles are the best. I always get the sansai udon (with mushroom) and it literally feels like a hug. Best comfort food. Their edamame is always salted perfectly!! I could pass on the bacon but my boyfriend enjoyed it. Everything here is amazing - never had a bad experience (and I come here often lol).
4812,"Raku's food is just music to your soul. I have been to the East Village location before, but this was my first time going to the McDougal Street location. I think the East Village is more suitable for dates whereas this is better for groups since it's a larger place. It also accepts cards which the other location does not.Everything at Raku feels intentional, from the choice of seating to the serving bowls to the chopsticks and the napkin. The food is full of flavor and has an amazing aroma. They aren't shy with their portions or their ingredients. I can't recommend just one thing because everything is so good!I highly recommend Raku, especially on cold nights!"
4813,I didn't find the food is that good... mine is salty with little ingredients. I would expect more with this price. $ 30/ per person  before service fees.
4814,"First time in NY coming from SF, I asked everyone I knew where I should make sure to eat, and every person mentioned Raku. Naturally I had to try it.Pretty busy location, we had to wait an hour but they had a nice table waiting system so we just walked around the neighborhood while we waited.We got the cold udon, duck udon, beef udon, and curry udon. We also got the carpaccio, ankimo. Now I've gone to places like Marguame and Mugizo in the Bay and honestly I was like, how good could udon even be that it could be worth this type. MAN I couldn't have been more wrong.The noodle texture here was bouncy and velvety and not too thick. The broths were so clean and flavorful and unique across the different varieties we picked and the portion sizes were HUGE.The sides we got were also sooo good, maybe one of the best ankimo I've ever had.So glad I got to try this place. I will 100% be back!"
4815,"Little place with amazing udon! We stopped by during our trip to NCY while we were in SOHO. The wait was around 40 mins on Saturday lunch. Bc they place was small so not much table. But the food made up for it. We got the curry udon, the fried chicken and 2 different kind of udon. I have to say I'm very happy with my bowl of udon. I never had curry udon before so I was kinda worry that I won't like it. But I really like it!!"
4816,"Boyfriend and I went to Raku and loved it!! First time having cold udon and was pleasantly surprised. Place was small, tight and busy but overall we enjoyed the food very much. A bit pricey but great experience."
4817,"Hurry and make a reservation if you can! The wait times for Raku are long and only getting longer as it gets colder in NYC. Their udon is the best I've had and is one of the things I crave when it's cold out. My favorite things to get are their washyu tataki, chicken tatsu-age, and niku udon. Their washyu udon was also tasty but the niku udon has the richest flavors in my opinion. I always end up ordering Mochi and extra udon to go into my broth, and this is the only place where I actually drink the soup! I've also gotten raku as take out and they have yet to disappoint. Definitely make reservations and give it a try!"
4818,"Public Reminder to get a reservation for this place, as this place is pretty popular. I went on a Sunday afternoon around 4 pm and this place was incredibly packed.I was going for the Salmon pressed sushi but unfortunately, they did not have this available that day. However, I got recommended the mackerel sushi which was amazing within itself. I also got the Washugyu Tataki as well and that was equally delicious. For those that do not know, Washugyu is a hybrid cow breed that is bred between Japanese Wagyu and American Angus. I also got the Curry Udon which also came with thinly sliced Washugyu beef. The noodles were thicker than I expected, although this is just an observation and not a complaint, the noodles did extremely well in carrying the broth from the bowl to my mouth. The only minor complaint I'd say I had was that the broth itself was a little bit water down for my liking but overall was still delicious.This place was an amazing experience for someone who loves noodle soups, so I definitely would recommend giving this place a try."
4819,"My friend and I came in on a rainy day and were in the mood for anything warm and comforting to fill us up. Turns out, Raku was a great choice.We were greeted by the hostess and had our vaccine cards and ID checked and were seated promptly.My friend and I ordered the Ankimo, chawanmushi, a couple types of udon, and the kaki furai.I highly recommend the Ankimo, chawanmushi, and the udons as they were all warm, flavorful, and filling while the kaki furai batter was a bit thick and was the only thing we didn't finish.Service was great and food was great, five stars."
4820,"Everything here was delicious! That's coming from a group that had ridiculous amounts of carbs before and still had an appetite for this place. The size of the bowl is not just for aesthetic because the portions here are BIG. From the chewy hand pulled udon to the flavorful broth, we enjoyed everything we got: Agedashi tofu: seasoning was perfect, just could have been crispierTantan: strong peanut flavor Curry: rich and thick, but also not too heavy. Came with lots of wagyu beef Niku: clean beef broth soup - I can see why it's a favoriteTempura: classic and delicious We didn't have reservations, so waited for about an hour (aka ate more food nearby). Luckily, this spot is bigger than the 6th St location. Service here was very attentive! Our water cups were almost always full. I loved the frozen grape at the end of the meal, but wish they gave us more. Next time I'm back in NY, I'll have to come back!"
4821,"Probably some of the best noodles I've ever had, highly recommend checking out this place!We came here on a Friday dinner around 7:30 PM, the wait was ~1 hr for 4 people. But we ordered as soon as we got in the restaurant and the food came out incredibly quickly, we were done eating by 9 PM. We ordered the Vegetable Tempura Udon (Yasai Kakiage Udon), Cold Dipping Udon, and the Oyster Udon. The portions are quite large so 3 dishes were plenty to share among the 4 of us. The noodles were the perfect chewy texture in the dishes and the broths felt clear, yet rich. My favorite broth was with the Oyster Udon. The service was great and quite fast and we were very impressed with the value of all the dishes. Would definitely come here again! The only thing I would do differently is to book a reservation."
4822,"Raku is hands down my all time favorite. It is the first place I have to go whenever I'm back in NYC and also the last place I go to before I leave. It is so comforting, so good and at such affordable price point. I have tried many different udon and appetizers as dine-in and takeouts. Their hot udons are unbeatable. You cannot get enough of the noodles -- it's hand rolled so chewy and unique! Some of my favorites include nameko, wagyu and niku. I recently tried their cold udon - Zaru and it was amazing as well (good for summer!) Classic appetizers include fried chicken, sabazushi and salmon oshizushi. Have to say sabazushi is better than the oshizushi. YOU MUST TRY IF YOU EVER VISIT NYC!! PRO TIP: 1. You can walk in but would suggest making a reservation 2. This is one of the few places that is still quite good during takeout (kudos to the staff for packing delivery so well! They put noodles and soup separate which makes it easy to prepare)"
4823,"Took two tries to gnab a spot at this place as they don't take reservations. Worth the wait! We had the  Gyunan Udon, the Mackerel Sushi, and the shrimp tempura. Portions of the udon and Mackerel Sushi were large, the shrimp tempura was perfectly light and airy. The quality of the meat on the Gyunan udon was also marvelous. The mackerel and tempura were absolute knockouts for me, udon broth was pure and authentic but could have used a bit more flavor for my palette."
4824,"Chicken Tatsuta-agetme here on a Saturday evening around 6pm and was told it would be about a 90 minutes wait for a table of 3. My friends and I went to a boba spot nearby til our place in the queue was up. We shared the Chicken Tatsuta-age which was great, the sauce was amazing. For myself I got the Niku Udon with spicy chili oil. Incredible! The honeycomb tripe was soooo good. Definitely worth the wait!"
4825,"I've heard so many great things about this place and it did not disappoint. I'm a huge fan of Udon and this has to be the best bowl I've ever had. The restaurant itself very cute as well and theres plenty of outdoor tables and tables/booths inside. The pricing is also very reasonable for the quality. You can get a huge bowl of udon for usually $10-15, depending on what you get.The Soho location takes reservations and its not too hard to get one for the next day. This location also takes card payment while the East Village location is cash only. Chicken Tatsuta-age ($8) - This is like a crispy fried chicken appetizer. We got 6 pieces and they were huge. Definitely get this to share for 2-3 people. Also came with a nice sauce. The chicken itself was super crispy on the outside but juicy on the inside! Ebiten Hot Udon ($15) - I got the Shrimp tempura udon, which came with two pieces of shrimp tempura and several pieces of other vegetable tempura. The tempura itself was super crispy. The soup felt very clean and the udon noodles were very chewy. Definitely tasted like they were homemade! Portion size was also huge - definitely could be split for 2 meals. Service was also very nice and they give you frozen grapes at the end of your meal! Definitely best udon in the city."
4826,"If you like udon, this is a must try. I'm a huge fan of udon and noodles in general, and Raku is probably the best udon I've had, especially at its relatively cheap price point. The insides are really nice, but they also have a pretty cute outdoor seating. They also have dividers between tables for COVID safety.Gyunan Udon ($17) - This udon has a savory broth that was pretty rich. There was a good amount of lean beef that was cooked well. Combined with the veggies in this bowl, it makes a great healthy-ish option for noodles. However, the highlight were the udon noodles-the most chewy noodles I've ever had. Overall, Raku provides some of the best udon noodles in the city for its price point."
4827,"Amazing service from start to finish - we were greeted warmly by all staff, and were seated promptly as we had a reservation for our group.They have a wide variety of appetizers and different kinds of Udon options. Being an Udon lover, I was ecstatic to see so many viable things to choose from! In the end, I went with one of my favorites - the Sansai Udon.Sansai Udon ($13.00): Served with Mountain Vegetables and Organic Maitake Mushroom Tempura. The broth is so warming and delightful - although it is a simple clear broth, there's a subtle savory sweetness that I always look for in Sansai Udon. It was hard for me to not drink all the broth because I wanted to finish the noodles too! Raku's Udon is a little different from others; their noodles are flatter yet still have the same chew and bounce as the rounder/cylindrical Udon noodles have. I was also able to try my friend's Niku Udon (Beef Short-Ribs, Honeycomb Tripe), and it was remniscent of Beef Noodle Soup. Really great flavor, although I still preferred my Sansai broth. My boyfriend got their Zaru Udon (Chilled Noodles w/ Dipping Sauce), and it was also very delicious. Another friend got Curry Udon, and although it was tasty, it's not what I usually go for at a Udon restaurant - if you like Curry though, you may like this!In the end, you really can't go wrong with any of their options. The noodles are quality and so are the broths. Will absolutely come back when I visit NY again."
4828,"The service is super! My friend made a reservation online, they asked if we wanted to be seated indoor or outdoor which I thought it's a pretty good gesture. Upon going into the restaurant they do ask us to check our temperature and sanitize our hands. The menu is now the QR code. They have a lengthy menu with lot of selections and it was my first time trying it and definitely will come back and try the other udons and appetizers!"
4829,"I'm sad to be writing an OK review about this place because I was so excited. My boyfriend had raved about this place, the snow crab udon and the agadashi tofu! We went back for Saturday night date night. First thing that wasn't overly appealing was that we showed up to our 8pm reservation and had to wait for another table to leave. 10 minutes isn't overly long but when it's 15 degrees and you have to wait outside... less than appealing. You know it's a popular place when they don't apologize for the wait either lol but I digress. It's hard to be patient when it's cold!! Made our way to the tables, they are tiny and close together so be prepared to share conversation with your table mates. Also it's extremely well lit in there, great for noodles but I would not pick this place for a romantic date (my bad!). Didn't dock stars for that though. They also don't have coat check so we had to sit on/drape our coats. We ordered everything opposite of when my boyfriend came here the first time and raved about it.. which can have mixed results. Sadly, the results were not as good :( We got the tuna appetizer but it was nothing special and should've gotten the tofu or something more jazzy. For the meal I got the niku with a side of mushroom and my boyfriend got the clams. I've never had udon soup before so it was an interesting mix of a somewhat rich broth and yummy ingredients. The udon was fabulous! So tasty, chewy and I can see what the hype is about. The beef was tender but I was disappointed with the mushroom. It was marinated and I only got one, singular mushroom lol I think I was expecting it to be mixed into the soup. Our server probably should've explained that to us better. My boyfriend's clam soup was interesting.. it claims to be littleneck clams but they were HUGE! And sadly overcooked because of the hot broth. The broth was a very light miso broth and not what he was expecting. Note: lots of orders for the shrimp tempura udon, duly noted!Overall, it was not a bad experience, just simple not one I'd wait an hour for."
4830,"This place is one of my go-tos in NYC and will take friends or co-workers here if we didn't have anything else in mind. Ootoya always delivers high quality and delicious fish from the cooked dishes to the sushi/sashimi dishesThey make their tofu in house so I would recommend trying it if you like tofu. Depending on where you sit, you can see the machine that makes the tofu!I usually get a noodle set because I really like their soba. I get a katsu or chirashi bowl with soba and depending on how hungry I will also add more food into the set. I love how customizable the meal is and how it's served on a tray with all the items that you selected. I LOVE their soba so much, cold and hot are both really really good.Come Again? Yes yes yes! I've come here countless times already. For me it is on the pricer end for a meal but I know when I come here I will have a good time and good food!"
4831,"This was my favorite meal in New York. The atmosphere was relaxing with dim lighting and calm music. I sat at the bar and was initially overwhelmed w the menu choices but the waiter recommended the Shima Hokke set w the default options. The fish was theeeee most juicy grilled fish I've ever had in my life. You could press on the flesh and more fish juices would come out. Delicious. Of course I soaked up all the fish juices w rice. Beware that this fish has an insane amount of bones. You can see in my pix, in addition to the main spine, I had a side bowl of little bones as well. It's def worth it but not a dish to eat in a hurry. The miso soup didn't have tofu but daikon and carrots instead, I enjoyed it. The rice was fluffy and fragrant. The salad was a mix of ice burg and water cress and I had the ginger miso dress. When I finished my meal the waiter brought over a cup of hot green tea. Lovely way to end the meal. There are many delicious restaurants in NYC but I'm definitely Ootoya's target customer. I can't wait to come back."
4832,My friend recommended this place and I am very glad I found it.Close to the union square which is a very cozy and inviting restaurant.The wait staff are very attentive and attentive.I don't even need to write anything about the foods. Everything is perfectly cooked and presented very well. I had hot soba for the cold day and it made me my stomach warm and satisfied.
4833,Awesome Japanese cuisine dining...no matter if it's lunch or dinner....dining alone or with friends
4834,Came here with my coworkers and whoa I am blown away. Not only at the food but the presentation and the extremely attentive staff and the ambiance. It all felt really upscale. I got the grilled Japanese butterfish (can't remember what the proper name of this was!) but it was very light and delicious. The flavors were on point! We also shared a couple of appetizers. And okay can someone who is 12 and under please order the kids meal for that cool presentation that is a whole space shuttle?!
4835,"Seasonal Japanese curry!Washu beef katsu donabe curry:It was a mixed curry blend of tomato, potato, melon, w/Hijiki seaweed rice. The katsu breading was very crispy but it was too bad the Washu beef was cooked well done, which made me cry a little inside. Overall it had nice flavor and crunch."
4836,I thought everything we got was pretty good but nothing really blew me away. Got the chicken donkatsu and the salmon ikura don. The chicken katsu was flavored nicely and fried very crispy. And salmon was fresh and went very well with the rice. Prices were a bit overpriced but it's manhattan.  Service from our server was friendly but thought the male hostess was not the nicest.  Overall a solid Japanese spot in the area.
4837,"Great location in the chic neighborhood of Chelsea. Within its unassuming storefront, this little Japansese restaurant is serving delicious katsu and udon.I decided to try something familiar so I went with the katsu and curry. I love a good katsu and the curry especially, and the flavors here were good. Unfortunately, the pork was tough and chewy. Overall a B+ performance."
4838,"found this place since it's participating in the nyc restaurant week 2022 and I am so glad I did! the dinner prix fixe menus (a $39 or $59 option) were delicious and comes with so much food! (see pics) I ordered the sukiyaki gozen and my bf got the unagi gozen, which was $20 more. both were VERY worth it! the first course for both was an uni tofu which was super savory and tasty but a small portion that opened up our appetites. our main courses came with 5 sides each, including 3 kinds of sashimi. the salmon was my favorite! the only side we weren't fond of was the umaki (an eel egg omelette) it was just cold and kind of bland. the dessert (original matcha anmitsu) was what I was looking forward to the most! it was so refreshing and had various different flavors and textures! the service was also 10/10!the only downside was that they were missing some drinks on the menu (everything in the box that says original cocktail) & on the menu it says there would be homemade pickles, but there weren't any on our trays. :/"
4839,"You know the restaurant is good when there's already a line of people waiting before the restaurant even opens for dinner.  The food as you would expect is very authentic and has a lot of selections that you don't normally see at other Japanese restaurants. I recommend getting their Teishoku sets, which come with several side dishes like pickled vegetables, soup, egg custard etc and it's only a few dollars more than getting the entree on its own.  Everything I've tried here have been delicious.  You really can't go wrong with any of their menu items.  The restaurant is pretty small so it's not particularly good for large groups."
4840,"Came here for Restaurant Week Feb 2022 Dinner and was soooo amazed. We got the Sukiyaki set and Unagi set and both were freakin' delicious. The portion sizes and quality were great. The Sukiyaki was not too sweet, which I liked because I feel some places make it too sweet. The Sukiyaki is definitely a bit more of a home-style dish, something that just warms the soul and makes you feel good. Then the Unagi was just like fat amazing gooey glazed pieces of heaven. The sashimi that came with the sets was okay, nothing too special but I liked getting it as part of the Restaurant Week deal anyways. The uni tofu appetizer was really good and enjoyable though, light and refreshing. And dessert was really the cherry on top! Matcha ice cream with red bean and mochi is a pretty popular and familiar asian dessert, but what I thought was unique was how they gave soy milk with it to pour over. It added extra creaminess and I loooved that. Definitely want to come back and try a bunch more things on their regular menu!!"
4841,"This place is one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in the city. The katsu curries here are so good, as are the udon noodle soups and bowls (I love the katsu egg bowls). Consistent, excellent service, and outdoor dining that's cute and COVID Friendly. I will say that outdoor dining here in cold weather is not super enjoyable as it's unheated, but perhaps that'll change this year as the COVID situation changes and/or they evolve their cold weather dining. Will be back."
4842,"Went here for lunch with a coworker on a warm weekday. We were greeted and seated quickly on their covered outdoor seating. We got some tasty lemon uzu drink and the crispy rice promo they were running, 5 assorted pieces for $28. If you've never had crispy rice sushi it is a treat and you gotta try it! Their fish was very fresh and tasty, and you could tell it was authentic. The meal was rounded out with some complimentary green tea. Overall a very pleasant experience, I'd recommend it!"
4843,"Came here on a Thursday evening to get dinner with a friend. When I arrived at around 6, there weren't too many people dining, but the outdoor dining area soon filled up!I got the sukiyaki meal, which came with a large pot filled with thinly sliced beef, leeks, tomato, enoki, daikon radish, and shirataki noodles simmering in a sweet and savory soy-based broth. There was also a bowl of rice, miso soup with some carrots and daikon, and a side of daikon+carrot pickles.The meal was very hearty and the sukiyaki was delicious and soothing! Perfect for a cold day (although it wasn't too cold that day haha)My friend got the bento box. On the menu, it says that it needs to pre-ordered, but she was able to get it without pre-ordering. The menu doesn't list the price but it was around $35. The bento box came with a variety of rices, meats, and vegetables -- perfect for anyone who wants to have a taste of everything.Overall, Ootoya has a lot of Japanese comfort foods that are pretty generous in size and quite delicious!"
4844,Our waiter for the evening Mr. Garrison he was professional kind and came by to checked in with us often. Food was delicious and we will be back to visit again.
4845,"We originally had a reservation at the union square location, but after showing up, they said that they were unexpectedly closed due to a broken air condition unit. We decided to walk to the Chelsea location instead and the staff were nice about accommodating us. I ordered the curry Tonkatsu and I thought it was pretty good. The portion is a little small for the price, and definitely only enough for one meal. The tonkatsu itself was crispy and had a good amount of fat. The curry had a good flavor as expected. My friend got the Washu beef sukiyaki nabe, which is what the place is known for. It doesn't come with rice so you'll have to add the teishoku set (rice, miso soup, pickles) if you want rice. Overall, thought this place was a little expensive but tastes pretty good"
4846,"I found this place while it was participating in Restaurant Week and I loved it! I got a table upstairs and the interior was so beautiful.The waiter was very attentive and the food not only looked great, but tasted amazing. I especially recommend the beef sukiyaki but I also tried my friend's dish and their fish options are great choices as well. Perfect spot for a date or a day out with friends!"
4847,"Delicious food, pleasant staff. The potato balls were to at least to say mouth watering and overall amazing!"
4848,"I ordered the Katsu Curry for takeout and it was delicious! The Katsu was well seasoned and crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. The Chicken Karaage was also good and pretty standard for Japanese fried chicken. Overall it seems like you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu!"
4849,"Second time visiting Ootoya, apparently this place is well known for people who live outside of NYC as well. We had a great experience and the food was super tasty and flavorful. Would recommend."
4850,"This has always been my go to sushi spot. The 4-star review is due to the fact that they aren't serving sashimi and sushi bowls during the pandemic. There is a slightly different menu but their website has not been updated. We were a bit disappointed as we were looking for a sushi spot.Making reservation (a must) was easy via Yelp and the outdoor setup is decent, but you definitely need to keep your coat on.We had the okonomiyaki (delicious), beef sukiyaki (perfect dish during the winter), and the grilled butterfish. The butterfish was about average - the fish didn't taste super flaky and buttery. Service was decent, although the hot tea was not even warm by the time it was poured into my cup."
4851,"Me and my friend wanted some Sukiyaki and found this place on Yelp, and it was such a pleasant experience! The atmosphere is great, interior decoration is perfect for a date night :) The sukiyaki is really good and their fish on the sushi is very fresh as you can see in the picture. The waiter is very nice too"
4852,"Atmosphere: the place is very spacious indoor. I went at 12pm for work lunch and it wasn't too crowded. I will give 4/5 for decor and cleanliness of the place. Would be a pleasant place to come with a date or small group.Food: 3/5 it was not bad but it wasn't anything special. Crispy rice roll idea was interesting with some fried rice in the roll but it wasn't wowing. The sushi was relatively fresh. My lunch partner liked the ginger.Service: 2/5. I asked to replace the shrimp and they told me I could not and said that is not the nicest tone. Also, what if someone is allergic. That just seems wrong. My lunch partner and I traded but I thought that was not very nice. Also, they took forever. It seems like they are under staffed and were focused on packing take out order. My lunch partner had to go back to the office at 1pm for a meeting and it took them 30 minutes to bring out the food. She had to go and hurry them. I understand soup can take longer time but if it does they should have let us know so we can make the decision. In general, the lunch was light and healthy and I enjoyed my time with my lunch partner but I probably won't come back."
4853,Had the salmon and chicken curry dishes with matcha ice cream for dessert. The rice was very aromatic and overall a solid place.
4854,Everything I've tried here has been delicious. Their stews and their eel are both extremely flavorful and melt in your mouth. I am never disappointed in what I get here. The only downside is it is incredibly expensive.
4855,"Came here for a friend's birthday lunch, and had high hopes. This place had solid reviews and friends of friends said I had to give this place a try.First thing that caught my eye was the staff's attention to health with santizer everywhere and keeping some distance while speaking to us at the table. That was really appreciated. Another thing I noticed was the prices. They were def on the higher side, compared to other identical restaurants. For what they're charging, the food had to be on point and really amaze me. Sadly, that wasn't the case. I ordered the gyu-don with a side of udon noodles. The Gyu-don (beef and rice) was REALLY good. I wish they made this in a larger portion because I could eat that all day. The beef was tender, the onions sweet, and the sauce over it was the perfect umami bomb you want/need. The udon was fine. I mine it's really just plain noodles but the sauce it came with was literally brown water. I'm not sure if it was a dashi or something similar but it literally had no taste whatsoever. If that were better, I think I would have enjoyed my meal more. The majority of our group ordered the unagi set, and not a single person finished. I gave it a try and WOW was it fishy. It was quite shocked and understand why they left it. TLDR: The staff is nice but the prices are way too high for the quality of food served."
4856,I was contemplating between the tonkatsu or the sukiyaki. Tonkatsu was recommended by waitress. So I ordered it. Wish I ordered the sukiyaki. The tonkatsu was super dry and tasteless; hard to eat.We did share the shishito peppers and agedashi tofu. All were pretty good.
4857,I cannot say enough good things. Everything here was so fresh. Beautiful outdoor set up with heaters and such a nice atmosphere. My friend got a noodle soup and I think the noodles are handmade. We also got a lovely hot sake which hits the spot on a cold day. Absolutely everything was perfect!
4858,"Authentic Japanese dishes with great service! Ootoya currently has outdoor booths with space heaters set up which is perfect during the winter months.We got the salmon collarbone (from the specials), chirashi, and okonomiyaki. Everything was delicious! I especially loved the sticky purple rice and the main dishes came with miso soup. The food was super fresh and tasty and the servers regularly checked in to bring more tea and water."
4859,This is not an overall rating but specifically to this food. Always like the restaurant but recently tried the crispy rice sushi. I myself did not like it at all because the taste of crispy rice overwhelmed the sushi. I cannot taste the fish. What a waste I felt like I paid that much just to eat the crispy rice. :'(
4860,Had Thanksgiving dinner here and it was very good!  I had the wagyu special and its a must try.
4861,"Amazing service here! Everyone is incredibly friendly. I came here with a friend for a quick meal. We enjoyed the combination of chirashi bowl and udon, which was incredibly filling. We added pork belly and beef slices to our udon which was served in small portions but was heavenly. Our servers were incredibly attentive to us the entire time and diligent in making sure our needs were met. Very happy with the food and hospitality here."
4862,"A really nice spot for home style Japanese food although they do have sushi if you must. Japanese butterfish was grilled to perfection, gyoza anf fried peppers were also quite good. The highlight for me was the cocktail surprisingly. Bright, with the aroma of yuzu but nowhere near as sweet as I was expecting. It was actually shocking how much I could taste the flavor of honey without ruining the balance of the drink, highly recommend giving it a shot if you're tired of drinking highballs, sake, or shochu in Japanese meals."
4863,Had lunch recently and am sad yo report a marked decline in food quality.  We had 3 different lunch sets plus a few other dishes and all of them missed the mark.  I wonder if the cooks have changed due to Covid. This was one of our go to casual Japanese restaurants pre-Covid but we won't be back unfortunately.  Wokuni is far better (and way more authentic) quality these days.
4864,"This restaurant in the city may present some parking challenges so I would tell you to avoid driving in the city as much as possible unless you like to spend a lot of money in parking.As we came in my friend told me that they here do not take tips, that they pay their staff enough so they dont need to be tipped, I am not sure about that cause I did not ask but if anyone who reads this has any idea on how this works please leave me a DM I would love to know more. They also only have an additional restaurant in the city and another in Japan, so there are 3 total. As we came in we were lucky case they didn't have reservations at the time cause it was ned their mid afternoon closing but it seems like they get pretty busy so it would be wise to not do like me and make a reservation before coming. The host no matter where they are from they will greet you in Japanese and so all the staff in the restaurant as you enter as well as all will say farewell in Japanese when you leave, that was a nice touch in my opinion. The decor here is dark and simple, it is a very cold but at the same time well thought out decoration for sure. I can't say this is a sexy or romantic atmosphere cause I did not fell that way but it is well decorated. POT STICKERS - we got a couple of them and they were good, made as usual and not much different than the usual you can see anywhere you go for this specialty of food. EHO- MAKI ROLL- so this is a roll the is seasonal for a celebration of something and we ordered it but the waiter I guess forgot so we never got it, once we finished our meal we mentioned to him so he could take it out of the check, he asked if we still wanted but we denied as we were all ready for dessert. MINI BOWL: KATSU DON - it was ok cause it comes with the side but in truth this is only good if you will either get a bunch of other small things and appetizers or you not sure about the food and never had it so u don't want to be leaving food behind, but if you do know this dish I would tell you to get the regular size cause the amount of rice and carbs are way too much and the protein here is minimal on the case of a mini bowl. SIDE SOBA- they give you the option of hot or cold Soba, I got the cold cause I was told that it is the best tasting of its kind, and they were not wrong, I loved it, it was pretty nice and sort o fun to be dipping the pasta on the sauce, it was cool. taste wise, it was nothing very special or memorable. ANMITSU- this is a Japanese dessert it seems, I never seen before so I am to sure how popular this is out there, but there is green tea ice reran, some mochi balls, red beans and a sauce to pour on top. it was pretty nice, but again nothing super memorable. I think this place overall had good tasting food, and some of the meals here have great serving sizes if you know what your are going for, so do your research before coming over and make sure to do make a reservation cause with only 2 venues here in the city they can get pretty busy and a table can be a challenge if you do not prepare. I would come back here to try more of their dishes for sure."
4865,"Excellent yakitori & beautiful presentation. Everything was delicious, felt like we were having a tasty modern Japanese meal in Tokyo. The mackerel was especially spectacular."
4866,"DISHES I RECOMMEND:-Wings (Well seasoned and fried)-Chirashi Don (Fresh diced sashimi pieces over rice)-Sesame and Yuzu Sorbet (Save room for desert!)-Kake Udon (Broth was served hot and udon was cooked perfectly)EXTRA INFO:-Tip is included in the bill.-Free street parking after 7pm Mon-Fri.-Reservations are a must, esp for groups of three or more."
4867,A little overpriced for the food I feel. The restaurant itself is set up nicely with good ambiance. They staff was friendly and it was a positive overall experience. But for the $20+ per dish I felt like it wasn't really worth it. Some of my friends left still feeling a tad hungry after getting their entrees.
4868,"Place is open indoor and outdoor during covid. The food is really good and hot at first, however halfway eating you realize it is too salty (especially the beef pot). The entire day after we had to keep drinking water."
4869,"Loved the quality of their food and portions are great, easy to share between the table. We tried the Japanese butter dish, ootoya original unagi, Salmon Ikura Don, and the Buta Bara 3 Assortment. Everything was melt in the mouth and fresh, one of the better Japanese places I've tried. While it's a little pricey, this is a no tip establishment so it came out to be similar to another restaurant with tip. Can't wait to return to try more of their dishes."
4870,Great food. The service was great as well. The ambiance was great. I ordered the tonkatsu hot pot and the hot sake. The entree was great but the hot pot broth was slightly bland.
4871,Used to be one of my favorite places. Dined there recently and the food was just meh. Tofu salad used to be delicious and this time was just ok (dressing tasted differently). Kaisen Don was really cold and too small of a portion for $40 and crispy rice was an interesting idea but I didn't enjoy the popcorny rice. I am disappointed at the food and at the menu itself that is now limited to very few options. I am so sad about this!
4872,"The food was really yummy and it's perfect for when you crave Japanese food but are uncertain whether you want sushi, curry or something soupy and warm. Highly recommend :)"
4873,"Came here for a Saturday date night. Made a reservation which I highly recommend because this place is very busy and there will be quite a wait, even at 8:30pm on a Saturday you'll be waiting at least 20 mins for a table. Was seated immediately upon arrival. The restaurant is 2 levels and we were seated on the first floor near the bar. Appetizer: edamame- good, nothing different from any other edamame, although the presentation was nice. Main course:Salmon saikyo yaki- comes with grilled salmon, miso soup, white rice, house-made pickled vegetables, grated radish, and seaweed. Everything was very good and very fresh. I loved the marinade that was used on the salmon. Dessert:The sampler dish- I don't remember the exact name but it came with matcha ice cream, cheesecake (lemon flavor I believe) and one other dish that I do not remember what it was called but it was similar to a jell-o. Liked the ice cream and cheese cake the most. Really enjoyed it here. Service was very friendly. I will say that the desert took a while to get to us which was odd but other than that I enjoyed my time here and highly recommend this place - just make sure to make a reservation!"
4874,My Asian friend who has done a lot of. Us I was in NYC recommended this place   She said she feels it is one of the best in NYC   It did not disappoint. Everything was fresh made and great quality. Yum
4875,"You can make reservation or walk in.  We initially had a reservation for a Saturday at 11:30am but canceled it because we woke up late and would not make it on times.  Once we were ready, we called to see how long the line was at 12ish and they said there's no wait!  We got there in less than 5 mins of walking since we stayed at the W New York in Union Square.  We were immediately greeted by the host and walked to the high chair bar.  The atmosphere was very nice and comfortable.  The restaurant looked clean and the host was pleasant.  We were offered hot towels to clean our hands and the menu to look at.  After a long time of debating which one to order, we decided to go with an appetizer mini salmon sashimi, the ""beef sukiyaki nabe set"", and ""katsu don with cold soba set"". The beef sukiyaki was salty for me but the beef quality was very good!  My boyfriend enjoyed the katsu don with cold boba set and the mini salmon sashimi. He said the salmon sashimi was very very good! For dessert, we got an order of matcha ice cream with matcha jelly in milk and sugar syrup and an order of almond milk tofu! Both was very refreshing."
4876,"Get the cold soba! After hearing my friend proclaim her love for cold soba a long time ago, I decided to take the opportunity to try it here. In general, if you asked me to choose between a hot and cold meal I'd say hot, and I never like my drinks too icy, but I am fully on the cold soba train. The coldness somehow accentuates the chewiness of the noodles, and the combination of this texture with the strong soy sauce dip is perfect. It might just become one of my favorite meals. Ootoya appears to be authentic, as our Japanese waitress, visibly confused about our eclectic assortment of dishes, asked in what order we would like them to come out; I'm sure we committed a number of Japanese faux-pas, including perhaps ordering more entrees than there are people, of which I am frequently guilty #sluglife. In addition to my soba I also ordered a grilled fish meal, which was frankly plain and overpriced. I ordered a yuzu cocktail which was pricey and not that strong either. The cold soba was the star of the meal!"
4877,"Took one entire hour to get our food. Ineffective and slow service, during a time where the restaurant wasn't even busy. Really unacceptable - even if the food was good, you will wait an eternity."
4878,"I ended up at Ootoya on a hot NY summer day with a group of 5. We had originally intended to hang out at the Taiwanese festival at the park nearby, but it was extremely hot and humid outside. We sought out for shelter indoors at Ootoya looking for some food to cool us down.The wait was about 15-20 minutes for our group on a Saturday afternoon. I was so surprised that the Ootoya's in the US are fancier more high-end restaurants, because the ones in Japan are like casual home-cooked food. I ended up splitting a dish with my girlfriend because the dishes looked pretty larger and were on the higher end of prices. Food:- Cold Soba Set with Mini Salmon Don: The cold soba was such a good dish to have on a hot summer day. It was very refreshing with the cold soba sauce to dip in. The salmon don with ikura was delicious as well! Small, but lots of good fish in there.Overall, my experience at Ootoya was positive. My food was yummy and it was nice with the AC inside on a hot day. They have a large selection of Japanese food and different sets of the items. It was a very nice and fancy space inside, so just make sure you're aware of the higher price tag."
4879,"We had MisoKatsu, fried vegetable curry, and some of Oyakodon for lunch.  Every meal was delicious.   The waiters are kind and polite. Seats outside are comfortably warm with heaters and tables were carefully sanitized."
4880,"I wish I would have taken a photo of the food but I ate it on the go. It was busy and they had a 45 minute wait last Sunday when I pulled up. They also weren't taking orders over the phone at that time which wasn't convenient but I walked in anyway and placed an order at the to go side. It was pretty busy on both sides but with a place to wait. I waited like ten minutes for my shrimpAnd waffles with a side of Mac and cheese. Since I took it to go I actually  ate it cold not too long after -but it was still great. The shrimp large, tasty and fried to perfection. The waffles had syrup on the side which was helpful bc they were THICK. And the Mac and cheese was very very cheesy and baked in a little to-go soup cup. I was like they made this just for me (heart eyes). It's too rich to eat alone. I will return to try their indoor dining service."
4881,Haven't had really good soul food in a while so Amy Ruth's was extremely satisfying. Portions are huge and the quality of the food is as it should be. The fried okra was my favorite.  Prepare yourself for leftovers!
4882,"So while waiting in line for tickets for Tina at TKTS TKTS, one of the women working the line recommended Amy Ruth's. It is typical soul food. We arrived and were told it's a 20 minute wait only to have the man behind us told it was a 45 min wait. When we asked the man who I guess was the host ... he said ""a little wait - a long wait but you're getting on my nerves"". Well okay... after waiting a while we noticed the line did not move and decided to do to go. This did move quite quickly. So three of us order the Ludacras chicken wing meal (Mac and cheese, greens, cabbage, mash potatoes, and sweet potatoes.). I didn't taste the Mac or greens but the sweet potatoes were delicious. The cabbage was garbage!!! It only had shredded cabbage - not sure if it was steamed or fried with no flavor, seasoning, nada! The mash potatoes were basic. I was pleasantly surprised that the wings are whole wings. Oh heard my sister in law say the cornbread was good but I thought it wasn't very good. A friend joined us and she had the honey fried chicken that was quite crispy despite being in delicious honey. She had mac and then cheesy grits (which didn't look like there was much cheese but she seemed to enjoy her whole mealTo be honest... I guess this is great for tourist who want to sample soul food. As for me, I rather cook at home where I use more seasoning!"
4883,Ehhh besides the cornbread not sure what the hype of this place is about. Things were either too salty or too sweet. Disappointed in my meal but saw many other happy patrons in the establishment. So to each their own lol.  These are the ratings for the meals my table got:Jerk chicken with Mac n cheese and candied yams - 8/10BBQ chicken Mac n cheese and candied yams - 8/10Whiting with Mac n cheese and potato salad - 3/10 - fish didn't taste fresh to me. Reminded me of frozen fish sticks. Maybe that's what it's actually made of but ehh not my cup of tea.Catfish with collard greens and black eyed pea -6/10 seasoning was goodThe potato was pretty good. The Mac n cheese was too salty for most of my party. Collard greens taste like from a can with added sugar. At least the manager was nice enough to accommodate our table for the meals that weren't good. Waitress was also very nice and came back to the table to check on us many times. I personally won't be returning to this place.
4884,"I'm such a fan...and apparently, everyone else in the world is also!  Haha.  Dare I say this was the best fried chicken I've ever had?  It was perfect.  The chicken was crunchy.  It was spiced amazingly well.  It was juicy.  The Rev. Al Sharpton - Chicken and waffleThe Reggie Harris - Southern honey dipped fried chicken.  For the 2 sides, I picked rice & gravy and collard greens.I loved everything that we had.  The honey sweetness was great.  The collards had so much flavor.  If you're in the area, this is a must.  5 solid stars and another visit when I return."
4885,"So...like...folks SAY it's a competition for who holds the 'Best Soul Food in NYC' Crown.  But now that I finally had me some of what Amy Ruth's is serving up, that competition is clearly for the silver.Clearly!Lemme break this down right quick:Smothered turkey wings - big, meaty, tender and slathered with delicious gravy.  Homemade Mashed Potatoes - these were great.  I looked at em, said, ""Hmm.  Not enough butter."" Pulled out a stick of butter...but then I tasted the mash, and put that stick right back in the fridge.String Beans - One bite of a bean would get a child to eat something green.Fresh Salmon Croquettes - these got me.  I was put off when they arrived because they looked overcooked and dry, they didn't stay hot en route...they had me givin' side eye.  But then I took a nibble - cold - and looked around to see if anyone saw me acting a fool by misjudging these beauties.  First bite - COLD! - took me back to when we used to get underfoot in the kitchen because we knew the paper toweled-plate next to the cast iron had some of these on em and we'd get one to tide us over until the rest of the food was done.  They reheated perfectly and were not dry at all.  Maybe on the edge of too salty for some, but they truly were seasoned just right for this man.  Black Eye Peas - you will most definitely welcome in some good luck chowin' down on a bowl of these!Cheesy Grits - good!  I'm always worried grits will be too runny but these had some body to em plus good cheese flavor.Ribs - Y'all.  Yeah, they are big, meaty, heavy, tender, all the things.  But that sauce!  Not too sweet, a little tang, a little extra sauce so you get it in every bite, but not so much you're hunting around in sauce to find your ribs (and wondering if they're trying to hide dry meat).  SO good!Homemade Baked Macaroni and Cheese - this is that mac and cheese you had to throw elbows for at the pot luck to make sure you got any.  Homemade Collard Greens - stellar.  When I tell you I coulda got some but didn't need a drop of hot sauce so stayed right where I was and kept diggin in them greens....Jumbo chicken wings - you know when it gets around to Sunday afternoon and you at that house that makes the wings just right...so you make sure you get the seat at the card table where you can keep an eye on the kitchen...and then you hold on playing your card until you see the chicken hit the paper towels...THEN you take your turn, put your cards in your pocket and beeline to the kitchen knowing full well the table needs to finish the round before they can jump up and whoever is at the table has to clear it and now you're first for the chicken and don't have to set the table?  Those wings.Potato Salad - when I tell you about the perfection...tender potatoes, perfect balance of all ingredient, perfectly seasoned...just smellin' and lookin' as good as it tasted.  Coleslaw - tang, bite, creaminess and a little sweetness.Peach cobbler - if this don't take you down south/back home/wherever!  Huge portion, all the warm spices, peaches perfect (y'all know sometimes folks make em mushy.  Not here!), and that crust was so good!Sweet potato pie - welp, someone lost a foot up in this thing, and I was happy to eat it!  And they give you a whole, heavy personal pie?!  This thing was dense but tender, all at the same time.  About it!Creamy banana pudding - can't tell you cuz they didn't have it.  But listing it because they were awesome enough to change my order right after confirming it.  So I received an email letting me know it was out of stock and automatically had that portion of the order refunded.  None of that mess where you get disappointed when you go in your bag and have to request a refund.  THAT is the way it is done! Red velvet cake - almost a quarter of a cake up in that container!  That cream cheese frosting was great.  The cake was good!  I won't lie.  I had better.  But that generosity with the portion made it a-ok by me.And the single best compliment I can give Amy Ruth's?  I made my way through all those orders and never once used one shake of seasoning salt, one fleck of pepper, or one dash of hot sauce.  And I can't even tell you when the last time was that I tried this much of a restaurant's menu and didn't jazz something up a bit.Yeah.  You may lose a little sauce/juice/gravy cuz they use fish fry foam container.  But that bag is not wet because they throw that cling wrap right!  And isn't that part of the charm and overall experience if you really want that down home, ""I heard you wasn't feel well so I made you a plate"" feel?  Amy Ruth's may not know you from diddly, but they sho nuff gonna feed you like they do and leave you feeling like someone took real good care of you."
4886,"So sad and disappointed!Was meeting friends for breakfast and checked out the breakfast menu, but breakfast was over. At 11:30am on a Sunday?We tried to make the best of it.The grits were really good!The host and the staff were welcoming and professional!The seats are socially distant. The restaurant has plenty of space.They also told us that breakfast would be off the menu totally."
4887,"This plate is Jesus! It was exactly what I expected when it got here and way better than the myths. I attached a photo of the chicken and waffle. This food is two parts love and one part everything I didn't know I needed. The chicken fell off the bone. The waffle was dense. The mac and cheese are better than your mom's, not a slight, but everyone says their mom makes better mac &cheese; in this case, you're mistaken. The lemonade was too sweet for me; however, it was everything and more! First time in Harlem, this will be part of my experience everytime I come!"
4888,"It's just not what I remember...I remember hot food, fresh sides, and long, but worthwhile wait times. We came on a Monday, and were the first customers. The mac & yams were both disappointing, and those are my favs when I eat soul food. The mac seemed reheated, very gelled texture. And the yams were so big and tough. My friend got chicken and waffles. His wasn't bad at all! But he tried mine, and didn't like it either. This time around I didn't finish my food, nor ask for a to-go box. It could have been just an off day.I gave 3 stars because the staff was very friendly! Nate greeted us outside and he was a pleasure. I love the artwork on the walls, and very clean, especially for NYC."
4889,"Soul food is good for warming the heart and soul. So true for Amy Ruth's.   I've always wanted to try a legit southern soul food place in Harlem and finally a wish come true. We ordered 5 dishes to share. After reading everyone's reviews, the chicken and waffles seemed like a must try. And it's true!  All of us claimed that the chicken was perfectly marinated and fried. Seems like all the fried food is super tasty. The fried catfish was also delicious. We tried a verity of sides as all the entrees comes with two sides. The fried okra and steamed okra seem to be the fave. The black eyed peas were tasty and we loved the cheesy grits and the grits with the shrimp. YUM!  None of us really likes the collard greens and the cabbage. Probably not used to the way it's cooked. My only complaint would be that the bus boy kept coming by every minute asking us if we were done with our food. Even took some away before we could stop him. This was definitely good fuel food and perfect stop off for our 8 miles hike around Central Park."
4890,"Amy Ruth's still got it. This was one of the first restaurants I came to when I first moved to NYC in 2011. For some reason, I hadn't been back in a while - maybe because I live in Brooklyn (lol) but it didn't disappoint. The beauty of Amy Ruth's is its simplistic approach to soul food / southern cuisine. In a city where there are lots of hybrids and new inventive takes on it, they give it to you plain but not bland -- and very tasty. There was a bit of a wait because we went during after church Sunday peak but it wasn't too bad. 20 minutes. I had the President Barack Obama (chicken), Baked Mac, and Candied Yams. I also tasted some of my friend's Crab Cake and it was great. The kool-aide flavor of the day was grape and it was also good. The lesson here is go to Amy Ruth again, soon."
4891,Amy Ruth's is an institution. This Harlem establishment has been serving the BEST place fried chicken & waffles since 1998. The Tommy Tomita is my standby (3 juicy wings on a waffle) though there are tons of other combinations to choose from. Can't recommend this place enough- great for a casual meal any time.
4892,"Friendly service and phenomenal food. Nothing pretentious, just good home cooking. It tastes like they've been making the same food, and well, for a long time. Really worth a visit when you're in Harlem. What I had:Chicken & wafflesCorn breadCollards Mac & cheese"
4893,"We did to go orders because they are currently not open for dine in. The food took about 15 minutes to make on a less busy night right before closing. I got the Rev Al which is the chicken and waffles. I got a side of Mac and Cheese as well. The Mac and Cheese wasn't the best but I did like the fact that it wasn't oily, it was dry though. The waffle was bomb and tasted fresh that was my favorite part of the meal. The fried chicken wasn't bad. It was crispy and hot. The chicken didn't have much flavor but I was happy it wasn't greasy. They give a lot of food, sauces, utensils, and wipes. I highly recommend and it would go back."
4894,"I was stoked to visit this place after hearing how bomb their chicken and waffles were!We came on a weekend for lunch, so there was a line, but I didn't mind especially with their open space waiting area that played music. The place then separates into 2 opposite ends, with my boyfriend and I seated on the right side. There was no longer music here unfortunately. But it was cool to actually see a place implement actual 6 feet apart seating, as every table was far away from one another.Because of how busy it is, service was hard to flag, but everyone was extremely accommodating. They were also generous to offer complimentary buttery corn bread. We ordered The Rev. Al Sharpton Waffle ($19.50) and The Ludacris ($21.75), which came with the choice of 2 sides. We chose Mac n Cheese and Fried Okra.  The food came extremely quickly. And the portions were the biggest I have ever seen. The 2 sides can be a meals on their own! The waffles were definitely worth the hype, as it was the softest fluffiest thing I ever had. The juicy chicken, fried to perfection, offered a nice salty balance to the sweet waffle. Unfortunately, I didn't really enjoy The Ludacris, which was just 4 typical wings. The Mac n Cheese was super creamy, and the Okra, bland, but I didn't regret trying. Aside from their chicken and waffles, I don't think their other options are that special. Nonetheless, I love me some good comfort food, and I especially loved the chill ambiance and open space setting. Definitely check Amy Ruth's out if you're in the neighborhood!"
4895,"This had been on my list of places to try and I finally made it. I ordered the smothered chicken, collard greens, mac n cheese, potato salad, and sweet potatoes. The customer service was awesome. The togo service was extremely fast all employees I encountered were smiling and friendly. I love the murals on the restaurant walls. Overall I enjoyed my meal. The greens had some stems I could of did without other than that everything was prepared well."
4896,"This a little (not so little) gem in Harlem! I went there for some southern delights and was amazed. I had the President Barack Obama chicken and it was great. I had to ask for the hot sauce and was provided. Fried chicken was done properly that the chicken didnt lose its juiciness. I was first here on 3/7/17 and since then I have been there 2 times. Great place to hang out, beautiful and thoughtful wall decor and you can never go wrong in this part of Harlem!I had the pics of the food but gotta dig in my library, and update my review!"
4897,Harlem staple!! Food came out hot. And fresh.  They start you off with warm cornbread. Authentic Mac and cheese which was delicious. Definitely a must stop when in the Mecca
4898,Ambiance was wonderful! The murals they have all over the establishment are phenomenal! I enjoyed every second of our lunch. I had seared Salmon with candid yams and Mac and cheese. It was so yummy! Very distinctive taste. I will definitely be back. Worth every dime
4899,"I chose this as my last meal to close out 2021. I needed COMFORT and that's just what I got. Wowwwewee that's some good food. I tried the Barack Obama. Fried. With Mac and cheese. It's not creamy. It's more baked. And the mashed potatoes. Would try something different next time as they do don't come with gravy and that was def missed. I hear the greens are insane! I did delivery through seamless. It was right in tune. Carefully delivered. Hot and delicious. Perfect way to enjoy my last meal before the dreaded new year diet. I can't speak on the space as I haven't been since Covid but I remember loving the decor, vibe and music. I hope it's the same.  Will def return once I lose the pandemic pounds and need a reward."
4900,"Not a fan. At one point the food here was really good. Now everything is bland, old, and dry. I love that Bruce named their food after famous Black people."
4901,"One of the best fried chicken places around. It's no frills in case you didn't get that right away. We were dining inside and police were stationed all around due to some local activity. But anyway the chicken itself is tender, juicy and still crunchy. Everything I'm looking for. I went with the chicken and waffles the classic. Wifey got the honey chicken with sides. Collard greens and rice. Service was fine. Definitely comfort food heaven. Come and try at least once."
4902,"Needed a breakfast spot to hit up last minute and saw this online. It had good reviews and a friend recommended it. I have to say I was extremely disappointment. When I first arrived I asked for two waters, which had something floating in one of them. I ordered a cranberry juice which tasted like water. The complimentary cornbread was bland, absolutely no flavor. I got the Ludacris (4 whole wings) with Mac & cheese and string beans. Everything was bland, bland, bland. Absolutely no flavor and it didn't matter how much pepper I added, it was still the same. My bf ordered the waffle with fried catfish and a side of cheesy grits. His food was also bland! The fried catfish was okay because he had tartar sauce and hot sauce to add some flavor. The waffle was just okay. But the cheese grits were bland. I should've read more reviews because I seem some folks mentioning the same issues. Maybe it was a bad day for them but I doubt I'll ever go back. Oh and by the way, our grand total was $65. We didn't even order much. Would've been better satisfied at Waffle House to be honest!"
4903,Went on the weekend to support nyc biz...felt like soul food...happy to find this place! Ordered on phone...was ready in the promised 20 minutes even though place looked busyWe had The Michelle Obama(fried whiting w Mac n cheese n candied yams w cornbread....slammin!And the Assemblyman Keith Wright w same sides..slammin!Will def be back
4904,"Doesn't look much from the outside, except for the fact that there was long line when we were walking by. We decided to check out Amy Ruth's which is known for soul, home cooked food. We waited about 20 minutes until we were able to be seated. The menu is cool because its named after famous African American figures. I got the Al Shaprton which is waffles and chicken. You can get it fried or smothered. I got mine smothered (see photo). It was delicious. The meat literally fell off the bone as I started to dig my fork into it. They also give cornbread as an appetizer. The only reason I couldn't give 5 stars was that the menu was pretty pricey all around, and also the fact that our waitress didn't come to check on us, and we had to ask for the check twice.Give Amy Ruth's a chance if you're in town"
4905,Not impressed. The greens had a weird taste and the chicken tastes like it had been sitting. I guess I caught them at a bad time. I was disappointed because it's been on my list and I wanted to try them out. This Southern girl can not give 5 stars. Maybe I'll try them again earlier in the day and hope the food is fresher.
4906,"Amy Ruth's is a great soul food restaurant to visit in NYC. The inside decor is absolutely amazing and very inspiring. The walls are covered with paintings of well-known people of color who were important to America's history. If you are coming with friends, I definitely recommend ordering a variety of dishes and sharing a few. One of their entrees could easily feed two people, unless you are extra hungry. They start you off with this corn bread that is to die for! I would go back just to get a taste of their corn bread. I ordered their basic chicken and waffles and it was great. In my personal opinion I think I have had better at other restaurants, but Amy Ruth's was still pretty exceptional. The fried chicken was very tender and juicy and it was seasoned perfectly. Overall I had a great experience at Amy Ruth's and I hope to return and try something new from their menu and I suggest others do too!"
4907,"A trip to Harlem is not complete without a trip to one of the top three places for soul food. This trip we tried Amy Ruth's. We readily found 2 hour metered parking in front of the restaurant at 11am. The took our contact information and our temperatures before seating us. The seating is definitely about 10 feet apart. We ordered the Al Sharpton (smothered chicken and waffles), the Guy Woods and Shay Barnett (waffle with cinnamon, bananas, pecans), the Mac and Cheese Burger and fried okra. Oh, and I almost forgot the creamy cornbread. This is was a heavy way to start the day and we weren't hungry until dinner. The waffles were a base to the first two dishes, there was nothing spectacular about them. The Al Sharpton had well seasoned chicken but the gravy was a little heavy on the MSG. This is certainly not the dish to order if you're watching your sodium intake. The burger was like any other with a cupcake sized amount of mac and cheese on top. The waffle with bananas and pecans was good and what you'd expect from a home cooked. The fried okra was bland, I wish the batter was seasoned. The best part of this meal was definitely the cornbread which was complimentary. It was melt in your mouth creamy and made even better when smothered with butter. This is definitely the kind of food that you get when visiting your friend's grandma who grew up in the South."
4908,This food is always sooo yummy! That down-south feel right in Harlem! My favorites are the signature chicken and waffles or the catfish and grits
4909,Like this place - locals in harlem will tell you to avoid it and tell you they hate the corn bread - DONT LISTEN TO EITHER LOL .. DONT GO ON SUNDAYS ! The church crowds are brutal ! Food is guess is overrated because people know this place all over the world - but it's a decent place that accommodates plenty of people and has a rich history in historic ever changing neighborhood in Harlem
4910,"Amazing place that will be remembered as the best Southern food my family has ever had. My brothers like it so much that they went here 3 times within a week. What we tried:The Reggie Harris (5/5) -- This was the only time that I enjoyed fried chicken from beginning to end. Usually, the grease makes me nauseous, but the exterior was crispy while the interior was juicy. The honey wasn't too sweet either...would've been divine with some hot sauce. The Barack Obama (5/5) The Dr. Walter Delph (5/5) The Honorable Bill Perkins (5/5) The Brian Benjamin (5/5) Neal Shoemaker (3/5) -- Only one of my brothers thought the peach cobbler was delicious. My dad and other brother believed the peaches were cooked down too much and that the cake part had a weird texture. Bessie Mae Bass (3/5) -- Sweet potato pie was overly spiced to the point that it was off-putting. Texture was smooth and the crust was good!Herb & Elza Boyd (5/5) -- THIS!! Just thinking about it makes me smile. Light, airy, banana-y, dreamy banana pudding. By far the best dessert hereSides (5/5) -- The must-gets are the yams, coleslaw, and greens. Beans and rice were flavorful, but a little too al dente for me. The time that I came, there was a 20 minute line. Once we got seated, I noticed that everyone(even patrons seated after us) had been immediately served cornbread on the house except for us. We also had to wait for a while before we had to ask for our dessert and check."
4911,"As you can see in my photo, there was a little bit of mold on the corner of the sandwich. I moved the chicken pieces to get a better view. The restaurant offered me a full refund but this was unfortunate because I love supporting local businesses. The yams were delicious but I wish I was able to eat my entire meal."
4912,"Any Ruth's is not all that it's cracked up to be. People have said that food is phenomenal however , I came here one morning like around 11am & ordered food  and it was OK. The service was really good & the place inside is really nice. Overall, the place was overhyped."
4913,"Driving back from RI we had to take a detour to Harlem and stop at the legendary Amy Ruth's! Almost everything was great (wasn't feeling the rum cake or corn bread) but the chicken, waffles, Mac n cheese, okra, sweet potatoes and greens was excellent! Definitely will go back to try other dishes with an iconi"
4914,"Back at ya one mo gain. Amy does it again. Excellent service and great tasting food. Has the chicken and waffles, fish dinner and aide of collard greens . Excellent. Everyone left stuffed and wanted to go back. Southern home cooked soul food at its finest . Come give it a try you'll always feel like home and need a bed after because the food is so great and filling."
4915,"Quaint little restaurant. I didn't know what to expect from looking at the outside, especially as it's listed as an event hall. But it was my first time eating in the area and I definitely want to return. Clean, friendly and attentive staff. The food was GREAT! A little heavy for the time of day but I got what I ordered and a good size portion of it. I have 0 complaints"
4916,The food was completely disgusting. The food was not fresh.  The chicken was not good the   The collard greens straight out of a can  The string beans the same thing.  The food sat  underneath a warmer  The waiter took out order and came back without food less than a minute.. I will never visit this place ever again.
4917,"Ordered the chicken and waffles with white meat Was pretty good , the chicken was very dry and required the maple syrup to be smothered all over it to have any real taste.The Mac and cheese was amazing. Very well cooked and the cheese was really niceI would give this place four and a half stars if I could"
4918,"This is my all-time favorite soul food spot in all of NYC. This has been sort of a cultural institution throughout my life. I've come here to celebrate so many different occasions, from graduation lunches, Mother's Day brunches, birthday celebrations, and just late night after the club meals. Amy Ruth's has always been good. Sadly, i don't live in Harlem anymore, so i don't go as often as I'd like. I've been dying to go back for a while, since i haven't had it in a couple years. The great thing is, they're open. Throughout covid, they're doing takeout, and they're not 24 hours on the weekend anymore. But they seem to be thriving. I went in for dine in yesterday, and the place is socially distanced. They did not play games. In a huge room, it was probably 6 or 7 tables. More than enough space for each party to feel comfortable and not to hear other's conversations. They still give out silverware, which was a delight. Being that everywhere else has plastic utensils. AND!! They still give out the complementary corn bread fresh out the oven. (My favorite part). You can easily fill up on cornbread. So take it easy. It reminds me of the soul food version of red lobster biscuits, lol. The one thing i was missing was the music. I was hoping for the vibe i normally get coming here. I arrived a little before closing so i can assume that's why the music was off. I ordered honey fried chicken, red rice and beans, and sweet corn. I wanted mashed potatoes, but they were out. They close at 9pm on sundays. We got there around 820pm. Our food was hot, came out quick, and our waiter was pretty calm and attentive. I'll definitely be back to share and celebrate more memories, or whenever the craving hits me. If you haven't been, go! You won't regret it. See pics below"
4919,I wanna die here by drowning in syrup and butter with a mimosa chaser and consuming every single thing on this menu.
4920,"Amy Ruth's is a true Harlem gem. The line even in the midst of pandemic stretches outside, a veritable sign of quality. This is a place to be seen, the wall murals span across the restaurant and inspire conversation about life. I can't say enough good things about the quality of the food. I've ordered a few things off the menu and my favorite by far is their chicken and waffles dish. The serving is large enough to share but delicious enough to finish solo. The chicken skin bursts with flavor and crunches with every bite. The chicken I can only surmise is soaked in buttermilk because of how juicy the chicken is. They cater to the marginally health minded by offering white meat chicken for a small upcharge.The drink menu features many wonderful local options including Harlem and Bronx based breweries. I was all too happy to notice the pride the wait staff takes in knowing their drink menu."
4921,"Allow me to say that if I could give them a half of a star, I would. My daughter and I went to Amy Ruth's because this is 1 of our favorite restaurants when we travel 2 NYC. Well, this year was no different.   After the Thanksgiving Day Parade, we decided to go there 4 a nice meal be4 we traveled back to Baltimore.  The restaurant was scheduled 2 open at 12 noon.  We arrived at 12:08.  As soon as we came out of the subway, I figured that we might have about an hour wait.  Well, we ended up waiting until 3 pm.  Why, u ask?  Well, there was absolutely no organization 2 their admitting of guest.  The man who initially came out 2 get all guest's names that were dining in, put my name down and never returned to admit us or take anyone's name behind us.  By the time we got to the door, it was 3 o'clock.   Yet several people who were behind us went in 2 complain and got admitted in 4 carry out.  Then a woman who complained and was not even in line, got in before us as well 4 dine in.  By this time, I wanted to speak 2 the manager.  I told the manager what had occurred and the man who took our names said there was no way that he would leave a pregnant woman standing outside.   Now, now, now...this is perfectly ok to allow a pregnant woman 2 have a seat, but she should NOT have been permitted to make an order until after it was her time in line.  Oh, I forgot to say that the pregnant woman also called her husband inside 2 wait with her. (TO THE MANAGER AT AMY RUTH'S) In the future, if u know that u are going to get a rush of people, then why not require a reservation?  Or, just allow take out. Or, get rid of the employee who places names on an order ticket and invest in a text message app 4 your guest. Or,, limit the amount of time that guest can dine in, considering there is at least 100 guest (no lie) standing outside waiting 2 dine in.  Or,, at the least,, allow one line 4 take out and one line 4 dine in..  It is unacceptable 2 have your guest 2 stand outside 4 over 3 hours.  U do know that people r traveling from different states to enjoy the food there, right?   In the future, I would never patronage this place.  I will travel to Sylvia's place instead!  Needless to say, we never got to eat because we had a bus 2 catch."
4922,"Nice staff. We we're seated immediately.  Complimentary cornbread was delicious.  Not dry.I ordered the ""Ludacris"" fried shrimp! With cabbage & mac-n-cheese. The mac-n-cheese was a little salty. The cabbage was very flavorful.  Portions are huge too! Had leftovers  to go for later."
4923,"We where just here 4 months ago, and every time the food is exceptional! Home cooking at it's best!"
4924,Great service and food. Ordered the chicken and sweet potatoes and greens beans. Everything had taste and wasn't over seasoned. Good soul food experience
4925,"My first time here and I'm already addicted to Amy Ruth's!!!I ordered the Waffle and Shrimp (The Jennifer Holliday), and a side of cheesy grits and mac and cheese, along with iced tea that turned out to be a delicious sweet tea!My friend had the waffle with fried whiting (the Michelle Obama), with a side of collard greens and the mac n cheese and we both went to heaven during our meals. The shrimp and whiting were seasoned and fried to perfection, and the collard greens had an amazing smoke flavor that I've never experienced before. The prices are very fair and the service is outstanding! They do an excellent job of social distancing the tables, you definitely HAVE to try this slice of heaven disguised as a restaurant!!"
4926,"This is a updated review:My husband spoke with the manager and expressed our concerns.  He acknowledged that changes were made to the collard greens, but stated that they were not from the can.  They graciously refunded us for the sides, because the pineapple coconut cake and smothered turkey wings were delicious, so we did not want a refund for those."
4927,"I haven't been to Amy Ruth's in years and I almost walked past it. But when I tell you this place didn't disappoint then and it doesn't disappoint now!! From the service to the food to the music I was in heaven!! Whatever you do, don't change a thing! The waitress and waiter was so helpful and nice. Always made sure we were good.Let me be the one to recommend the peach mimosa. Delicious and not overpowering. I had the fried chicken and waffles. Chicken was juicy, crispy and well seasoned. The waffle smelled so good and tasted even better! I will definitely give this 5 stars. This place is a staple in Harlem."
4928,"So grateful for this place!!! Dependable flavors and serves all the staples. My favorite is the fried catfish sandwich. It's huge. The fish is plentiful, crispy, and well seasoned. With a little got sauce, hits the spot. I always get all the sides: mac and cheese, collard green, rice and peas, black eyed peas, cheesy grits, cabbage, mashed yams. They're all delicious. The corn bread is also perfectly soft and crumbly."
4929,The chocolate cake taste like boxed ingredients and the rum cake is not a traditional rum cake.It's like a yellow caked baked in a baking pan with crushed nuts drowned in rum. I did not and could not enjoy it.The grits are instant grits taste like savory cream I of wheatAmy's has good southern food but it's not original or uniqueIt' taste like southern fast food
4930,"The cheesy grits had no flavor, and neither did the fried okra. The smothered turkey and banana pudding were, however, pretty good! I came here for the first time almost 3 years ago and everything was amazing back then!Hopefully the food can one day live up to what it used to be."
4931,Love there chicken and waffles!  A must try if you haven't already . Mac n cheese is delicious !
4932,"I vacillate between a four and a five for Amy Ruth's. It probably depends more on my own mood than the food and service itself. Most recently, we easily ordered for takeout during Covid and sat outside while we waited for our order to be ready. We beat the crowd by just a few minutes. watching the line grow until they had to stop taking orders for a while to get caught up. We both ordered The Ludacris (4 fried chicken wings), one with collards and mac'n cheese and the other with cabbage and black-eyed peas. Everything was on point. Amy Ruth's is a reliable choice every time."
4933,"I love Amy's, let's just start off with that. On this particular day the Chicken was a little too salty for my taste, but it was flavorful and the waffle was tasty and fluffy !! In general , this is the place to be. The lady that took care of my friend and I wasn't too attentive and friendly while placing our orders to go. Could be because she was doing a lot , but I def recommend this spot  Taste:8.8/10Service:9/10Hospitality:7.8/10Price: $18 IG: Briannascravings ( Check me out )"
4934,VERY cool menu concept and cute murals on the walls inside. The service was excellent and there was so much to choose from. I had The President Barack Obama entree and everything tasted lovely. I will definitely return and highly recommend a visit here!
4935,the BEST soul food in harlem. I love the beef ribs. The mac & cheese & rice & beans are my go-to sides and never disappoint. The mimosas are actually strong & great for a weekend lunch. MUST try if you're looking for some authentic soul food.
4936,"One of my favorite Harlem eateries. This spot specializes in soul food. I've been going here since 2009, I always order the pan seared shrimp with collard greens, Macaroni and Cheese and cornbread. When you come in to order food, they have  the Kool Aid of the day, which is always a random flavor. It's Super nostalgic and reminded me of my childhood. The food is always served fresh and hot. Another thing I love about this establishment is that you see some of the same  workers year after year. The art on the walls are pretty cool too."
4937,"I will give the best Mac & Cheese in NYC medal to Amy Ruth's. Some other alternatives I'm weighing against include Red Rooster and Hometown BBQ. The Mac & Cheese was gooey, rich, comforting - all the things you want it to be. We got the Fried Fisherman's Platter with the 2 sides and the Chicken and Waffle. Callouts are: - Fried catfish was a surprise hit with how lightly fried it was, allowing the fish meat to shine. Fried shrimp and crab cakes were just fine - the crab cakes are Southern-style, so it has a lot of seasoning - Coleslaw was fantastic, refreshing and flavorful- The waffle was good as well and on the better side of waffles that I've had in NY- Same goes for the fried chicken, I'm glad it wasn't overfried/overcooked. By the way, smothered means getting the chicken fried and smothered in gravy, which is an option but we didn't opt for it- Cornbread was slightly warm, and texture was juuuust slightly on the more-than-preferably hard for my own taste, but flavor was great"
4938,Incredible. This was my second time coming here. My first in 2016. Both times I was blown away. You can feel the ancestral energy here and the Black power!! And the food feeds your soul as well. As soon as you sit down they serve you hot cornbread. HEAVENLY!! This food is cooked with LOVE to perfection. And the service matches the food. Amazing.
4939,"This is some serious cooking.  So good even the menus are greasy. Hands own they do not play and don't let me get started on that cornbread.   Yes, you have to wait but this is what I could only describe as ...  So good make you wanna slap your mama.  If somebody is in denial of their culture then take them to this restaurant and once they take a bite they will be lickin their fingers and it will all just come out.  Even if they're proper but inside just gangsta. It all comes out.  You cannot hide who you are because that food touches your soul.  Hallelujah Amy Ruth Hallelujah."
4940,"I'm visited NY from chicago and just had to try some NYC soul food! Food was very delicious, hot, and fresh! The atmosphere was homely & the customer service was good!"
4941,Food was fantastic. The portions are so large that everyone leaves with a to go container filled with mac n cheese and cornbread and yams that they can't bear to leave behind. I highly recommend Amy Ruth's and will definitely return.
4942,"The first time I came here it was about 5 years ago. I loved my meal. I went here this past weekend and there was some pros and cons. I had the honey dipped fried chicken and let's just say it was dipped more like smothered in honey. I didn't really enjoy it. I should have asked for the honey on the side. My Mac and cheese was good. My fried okra was horrible. The worst fried okra I ever had in my life. And it was served without a dipping sauce. Who does that?? My boyfriend had fries and grits as a side. I tried his and they were good. Maybe it was a fluke? I'm not sure. Service was also pretty slow and it wasn't crowded. Will I go back, maybe but I'll check out other businesses in Harlem first."
4943,"My husband and I needed a place to eat before an appointment in the Harlem area. We originally were going to Sylvia's restaurant but at the last minute I chose this one based on recent reviews and I'm so glad I did.The restaurant is so nice, beautiful murals on the walls, high ceilings and still socially distant tables and mask wearing required which I appreciated.Our waitress was so nice and sweet and handled the dining room and the smaller dining room down the steps, with ease!Menu looked great and there were so many platters I wanted to try! fried fish platter, shrimp n grits... but we both had our eye on the same thing and ordered the fried chicken and rib Platter with mac n cheese, greens and then a side order of potato salad. I also had sweet teaWe watched as the orders came out for other tables, and they looked so good!Finally ours came and it smelled and looked fantastic! The fried chicken was seasoned and the crust was perfect, no hot sauce needed! The Ribs were okay, tasted baked with heavy bbq sauce slathered on it. The mac n cheese was perfectly creamy and cheesey, so good! The greens were good but I prefer the big leafy pieces rather than chopped. The sweet tea was delicious and refreshing, not overly sweet. Potato salad was great and creamy. I also loved the complimentary warm cornbread they served before your meal arrived.I would definitely come again! Great generous portions of comfort food, beautiful dining rooms and very friendly service"
4944,"We were excited to try this place out- read some great reviews here!Well we were ignored by the staff for a long time, noticed multiple groups of ppl come in here and leave in the time it took to even get our food or receive the check. I politely asked for the check once and got ignored for another 15 minutes. We ordered the standard chicken and waffles dish - nothing special. Do NOT come here if you want to grab dessert elsewhere within 3 hours of the meal, because the place will be closed. One of the waitresses was nice (shoutout Marelyn) and actually got us our check out of the three we asked!Food was fire though!!! Bit overpriced for what it was, especially the sides (we got the cheesy grits and candied yams), but the chicken and waffles themselves were great."
4945,"The food was absolutely delicious. Enjoyed the chicken and waffles. The skin was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The grits were also on point. Taste took me back to breakfast in Mississippi at my grandmas house. My husband ordered the peach cobbler and was pleasantly surprised by the large portion they served. As far as the service, the people who attended to us were very attentive and polite. The bouncer at the door is really cool and does a great job of updating you with your wait times which isn't long (20 minutes on a Saturday). Our waitress was also kind and helpful. Overall it was a great experience and good times as always whenever we visit and dine at Amy Ruth's."
4946,My experience at Amy Ruths has always been amazing. This is a great place to experience authentic tasty soul food.
4947,"Overall, it was a good experience. The portions were a good size and although, the staff was limited the waiter was courtesy and going as fast as possible. I order the fried pork chops, with mac and cheese, yams, collard greens and okra. The mac and cheese was great. And the yams were good. The pork chops and okra lacked seasoning and the chops were dry (fried too long). The collard greens tasted like canned greens, instead of fresh greens .I can say that the food was solid."
4948,"Nice place to enjoy some good food when looking for soul food taste.The dining room was set up for great social distancing.  So definitely no problems in that area.  I watched the them sanitize table and chairs between customers. Good to see they taken the pandemic seriously.  At check in your have to fill out a traceability form that I had no problem filling out. The food was very good. Smothered Turkey wings.  Meat was falling off the bones. The wings was drained very good. The yams will have your mom's asking for the recipe. The cabbage was good. The chicken wings looked cooked hard from the outside, but they were moist and very tasty at first to last bite.  They are pretty big wings. The potato salad was ok.  I thought to much mustard, but still taste ok. The Mac and cheese was really good if you like it multiple cheeses. Overall this is an excellent place to shine at. And with there menu of plenty choices.  Everyone will fine something very good your in the mood for. Definitely will be back."
4949,This place is great! The food is delicious and service is pretty fast. I've been twice and am looking forward to trying it again.
4950,"If hot dogs were a currency, Crif Dog would be Fort Knox. This is hands down the best hot dog shack in the world. There are no bad choices, but the true stand outs are:Everything Dog - take all the guilt and shame that you love so dearly about an everything bagel and add some meat. Tsunami Dog - something about pineapple and teriyaki just meshes perfectly. Add some hot sauce and you're in hot dog heaven."
4951,"This is usually a staple, but they should NEVER run out of bacon wrapped dogs.  It's the base of HALF their menu.  That's like KFC running out of chicken.  AND THEN to charge their customers the same price for a replacement that is far inferior (and logically 75 cent cheaper by their menu) is literally stealing from their customers.  I don't blame the workers, but the management and owners should be ashamed."
4952,"Get the pastrami ""dog"" and nacho tots! To die for. Good cocktails too. Fun speakeasy!"
4953,"Location: east village. It's right next to the speakeasy. I truly forgot the name but it's FamousFood： I had the regular Crif dog for 4.5.  Ugh, I can pay 1 dollars for the same time. So I would ask WTF!Not worth the hype here. Thanks bye"
4954,"This is a pretty cool spot. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but their cheesy tater tots are so good, and they have an interesting variety of signature hot dogs. I got the Lil Ma dog. It's a beef and pork hot dog wrapped in bacon, topped with peanut butter, chips, and a pickle. The hot dog was juicy and tender but kind of mild in flavor. That was ok, though because it didn't overpower the toppings.They also have some retro arcade games. One really cool thing is that they have a secret entrance to a speakeasy through their phone booth. I didn't go there, as they open at 6pm and it was way too early when I visited but I would like to check it out in the future. The speakeasy is called Please Don't Tell.One thing they could change is that the music is too loud, especially if you sit at the counter which is near the speaker."
4955,"I'd been wanting to come here for YEARS.  But whenever I'd come by, the crowds of mostly people waiting for PDT were always much too overwhelming.  But for some reason, on a random Thursday night in October, we stumbled upon a nearly empty Crif Dogs and decided to take advantage.I love the vibe of this place.  It's a little gritty and a whole lot of fun.  There are arcade games near the entrance, and a tiny kitchen in the back pumping out hot dogs, fries, and tots.  The two people working the front of house (cashier and the person who brought the food to your table) were fun, friendly, and energetic.  I had the John John Deragon (cream cheese, scallions, and everything bagel seeds, $5.50) and small cheese tots ($3.95).  The cheesy tots were delicious, which should come as no surprise.  The hot dog was phenomenal!  Who knew cream cheese would go so well on a hot dog!  If you like everything bagels (who doesn't?), try the John John.The only thing I didn't like about Crif was that it got really smokey a couple times.  I don't know what their ventilation system is like in the kitchen, but it could use some work!Pro tip: Come before 7:30pm if you don't want to wait in line."
4956,"Apparently I've lived under a rock my entire life because I only recently discovered chili dogs. This was my first ""New York"" hot dog experience and it did not disappoint. I got the Chihuahua Dog and am still talking about it days later."
4957,"The veggie dog was awesome, but they don't have any vegan fixing options that needs to change... I could only get mustard and ketchup w onions. I ordered an impossible burger but they accidentally put cheese and Mayo & I could not eat it a huge disappointment"
4958,"For some reason, this was my first time going to Crif Dogs - I lived downtown for 4 years while attending undergrad yet never knew about it! We decided to go around 1am for a late-night snack after celebrating our friend's birthday. It is a classic hole-in-the-wall spot which happens to be connected to Please Don't Tell. There's a decent amount of seating. The staff is friendly and the cashier had a sense of humor ha.The menu has a VERY interesting selection of hot dogs, to say the least. Each dog is well-detailed, so you at least have an idea as to what you'll be ordering. I honestly didn't know what to get, but I certainly wanted something different. If you want to play it safe and get a regular hot dog, that is on the menu. They also have fries and other interesting sides! I went with ""Jersey's Finest Dog"", which is ironic since I'm a Long Island native but whatever :p - it was delicious. The hot dogs are all normal length - these are not foot longs. I did not ask if they serve larger dogs but I'm sure they do. You could always order a second one! I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in the city for a late night gathering :D"
4959,"Before leaving NY I had to look for a hot dog spot.  This place popped up after we were walking around town.  Their standard size hot dogs runs from $4 to $7, depending on which one you get.  They aren't very big which I appreciated.  I went with their $4 New Yorker which was a simple classic hot dog frank.  It was pretty good but nothing crazy.  I like that they had hot sauce and even BBQ sauce besides just your typical ketchup and mustard.  I also got a side of their small cheese tater tots ($3.95).  The small portion was HUGE and definitely shareable between two people.  The cheese sauce came on the size and it was pretty good.  I definitely recommend the tots.   The girl at the register was really nice and took time to tell us about their menu.  She also answered questions we had.  I like that they even had a vegetarian option for those who do not eat meat.  Their menu had so many different types of hot dogs.  Some smothered in cheese and some were bacon wrapped.  The food came fast and everything was good.  The inside of this place is very casual but unique.  Definitely recommend checking out if you are looking for some cheap hot dogs."
4960,"Crif Dogs is iconic, an institution, and by far my favorite hot dogs in NYC. However, the service we received tonight was horrible! I get it, it's the last hour before closing, you just want to be out of there, and you're tired. I understand, I've been there. However, that doesn't justify being simply so rude. As we were thinking about our orders, the girl at the counter goes, ""any day now"" and then says, ""are you ordering or what,"" even though I gave her forewarning we would need some time. Mind you, we had family visiting from Canada, so they needed a minute to look at the menu and figure out what they wanted. Also, the restaurant was empty so it's not like they were rushing to get orders in nor were we holding up any line.On top of that, a customer called asking if they could place an order, and they told the customer they were closed already, when it was only 3am. How could you turn away business from the establishment you work for. As small as that to go order may be, it's the small things like that that keep your restaurant running and alive. It's disrespectful to the owners who made the restaurant what it is today, to turn away perfectly fine customers, when you're clearly still open.I love this place, but I can't believe how poor the service was. At the end of the day, it's just food. It's a tiring job and a rough industry, but there's no reason at all to treat people like trash."
4961,"Great unassuming hole-in-the-wall place on the LES. Hot dogs are small but tasty, I tried the Chihuahua (wrapped in bacon + avocado, sour cream, and added salsa), but there seem to be a lot of other interesting options (one has peanut butter on it). Waffle fries are crispy & plentiful. Would be a great place to stop by for drunk food. Slight downsides: a bit of a wait & couldn't find napkins easily (you'll need them). Would return."
4962,Crazy hot dogs and awesome vibe!Small restaurant and very limited seating inside. Gets really crowded and cramped inside. Hot dog menu is large and the topping combos are pretty unique.Service was good and the hot dogs come out pretty quick even though they were packed.Spicy Red Neck - $5.95 - Cannot go wrong with a bacon wrapped hot dog topped with chili and jalapenos. Could have done without the cole slaw. Not as good as LA's Pinks but great alternative spot for NYC.And I still want to go to Please Don't Tell! I always forget to plan for it!
4963,"I've been wanting to try Crif Dogs for many moons. As luck would have it, an East Village food and history tour ended a couple blocks away on Sunday.Like Philly's gone-but-not-forgotten Underdogs, Crif Dogs requires a few steps down to enter. Unlike Underdogs, the prices are a little nutty. I love hot dogs -- like a LOT -- but I'm hesitant to pay over $8 pre-tip for a regular-sized dog wrapped in bacon and a slice of cheddar cheese not even melted in the kinda-boring roll.Don't get me wrong. I'll always get excited about hot dogs. But I don't think Crif Dogs would really be worth a return visit based on the price and quality.Tourist, trapped? Yeah probably. Maybe I would've felt different if it was late night."
4964,"Two starts because the kid behind the counter was nice. Otherwise. They got my order wrong. It took more than 20 minutes, to get a hot dog, mind you, and it was cold. I'd say all the hype about this place is misguided. I'd give it a pass."
4965,"So I don't really care for hot dogs, but you have to get one in New York, right? Some friends told us this place is a ""game changer,"" so we had to give it a try.Being mostly vegetarian, I ordered a veggie dog. I chose to customize it rather than selecting one of their options. Some ketchup, mustard, pickles, cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce later and I was a happy person. My husband ordered his own meat dog and we split the tater tots. Word of warning: the large tater tot order is HUGE. Really tasty, hit and just the right amount of crispiness, but a lot of tots.I thought my veggie dog was about as good as it gets given that hot dogs aren't my wheelhouse. My husband felt happy with his although he didn't feel it was a real game changer. They definitely get props for the veggie options & the fun old-school vibe, too!"
4966,Definitely an establishment to remember. The hot dogs and drinks are unique and surprisingly good. The hidden bar area is one of the coolest low-key spots in NYC. I am disappointed to just find out about this hidden gem! I will post pics when I return
4967,"I mean, what else is there to say about this place? It's a tiny, dingey, basement dive that has awesome folks working (and dancing!) behind the registers and the menu is filled with all kinds of tasty combinations of hot dogs and random toppings. The dogs themselves are nothing special and very much standard pushcart hot dogs, and the buns are fine fluffy white bread. However, it's all about the toppings!! So many combinations of stuff can be put on there. I had a ham-wrapped dog with slices of cheese and peppercinis on top, but it was a very hard decision as basically everything on the menu sounded (and looked) amazing!"
4968,"We only came to this place for the speakeasy ""Please don't tell"" I'm not expecting 5 star service but some decency... we went to place our order and the girl upfront was not helpful. We asked what her recommendation was and instead she looked at the other person working and said she'll take you. We placed our order for the hot dogs and waited. My friend asked for a side of raw onions and the girl said well your food is already in the bag... and  said it with a VERY rude attitude and very aggressive. Then we proceeded to ask and she just handed it to use and walked away. We asked the other girl for ketchup bags since we had placed our order to go... she was great and handed it over nicely. We waited for our ketchup and the other girl came back VERY RUDE AND CONFRONTATIONAL! she says you good! What did you say!!? Honestly thought she was going to punch my best friend. For reference wearing a beanie with big hoop earrings. Honestly show some class. You""re rude and unpleasant. I wouldn't go back."
4969,"Fried bacon wrapped hot dogs made to mess with your heart.. physically and emotionally. physically because it will slowly kill you while you eat it.. emotionally because you're happy while you enjoy eating its deliciousness and then sadly regret it while you walk out of the place asking why'd you do that to yourself.top 3 choices: don don with hot sauce, the redneck made correctly and not soggy, and the tsunami"
4970,This was a happy hour adventure! It's a fun place for a group. Good selection of drinks and happy hour cocktails. They offer snacks. I'm not much of a drinker but our group had a good time.
4971,"Short version:This is the best dive bar in New York City.  I say this as a person who really, really enjoys a good dive bar; I'm kinda cheap, I like good bar food and fun bar games and happy hour deals with friends.  I've been to about a dozen dive bars in NYC as a result, and again:  this is THE BEST one in the city.Long version:Been here a few times for drinks later in the night with friends, either just to hang or to unload at the end of a crummy day at work.  Friendly service even if they've never seen your face before, great deals ($6-$7 pickle-back specials, good beer on tap, fried pickles and tots, etc.), decent room to spread out at a table and equally good spots at the bar.I had a birthday very recently, and wanted to find someplace chill yet fun to invite about 30 friends to.  Being short on funds, I needed a place that didn't require a massive down-payment just to book some space...other bars asked me for $50-$80 PER PERSON to book half a room, I shit you not.  So after being shot down by 3 or 4 other venues who asked for a metric ton of money, I remembered the Whiskey Tavern and sent a quick email to Rob, the owner, expecting to get shot down again.He replies within minutes and says (a) hell yes, we can do your party, (b) we'll set up even better deals on drinks and food, and (c) send us your picture because we're going to make actual posters of your face in the bar.  ""Wait what?""  ""Yeah, really"".Fast-forward to my party, and he delivered in spades.  Walked in at 8:30 pm and my face was up on a banner, 3 or 4 posters and laminated table-tops, with ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!"" signs all over the damned bar.  We were welcomed in by a great waitress who was amazing and super warm, and took insanely good care of us all night (including bringing out a cake herself later on).  At one point, some drunk asshat pulled down some of the banners with my face on it.  Why?  because he was a drunk asshat and that's how it be sometimes.  But in SECONDS the staff came over, guided the little prick to a dark little corner and then put everything back up, after apologizing on his behalf and telling me it wouldn't happen again.  Frigging great service, really made me feel like I was in good hands.Rob himself came out later on and gave me a hug, a t-shirt as a gift, and the waitress offered us A FREE ROUND OF SHOTS on the house towards the later part of the evening.  Where else does that happen, especially in New York?  Nowhere I've seen.I have never had that level of good service and genuine warmth at a bar.  And I look forward to my next event, or party, or just opportunity to stumble into the place with a friend and grab a few pickle-backs.  Do yourself a favor and give this place a shot (pun sadly intended because I'm older now and am into dad jokes)."
4972,"Off the beaten path and located across from the jail, Whiskey Tavern is where you want to go to celebrate, because everyone is celebrating. We came here after a fun dinner at Puglia a few blocks away, and when the bartender learned that we were celebrating my friends birthday, he ran off, printed off a sign wishing him a happy birthday and promptly poured him a shot. Should also note this bar has... uh, a collection of toys? Adult toys. Yes. And they were also brought out for the birthday festivities.The music was a lot of fun, lots of 90's boy band and pop on our Saturday night trek. There's a $10 minimum on cards. It's a lively dive without veering off into trash territory."
4973,"We came in here since we were staying close. It was a bit loud although enjoyable.  We were greeted with a smile and hello from the most amazing bartender we've ever had. John is his name surprising you is his game. He truly is wonderful, friendly, fabulous, energy type of person. We actually already feel like we've been friends for ages.  We will definitely be back to this quaint bar/restaurant!! Come on in and enjoy yourself."
4974,"Whiskey Tavern is a decent Pub in the midst of Chinatown. It's a nice spot for happy hour, but beware this place packs out which is annoying because it's super small. They have bar seating and table seating, but those go extremely fast. They have bucket of beer specials which is nice and their food is good, I recommend getting the tots, they comes with a chipotle mayo sauce, it's delish! I ordered the fried pickles also they were good not great.I'm not a fan of the location or the size of the bar that's why I gave it 3 stars, but for what it's worth it's a good bar if you want to pop in for a few after work."
4975,"Truly overdue review for Whiskey Tavern. Yes, the best irish bar in the city is in Chinatown and if you disagree, go ahead, go to fucking Tir de Nog 40 blocks north and tell me how much fun you're NOT having. Cut to the chase, Whiskey Tavern is my favorite bar downtown, and could easily be my favorite bar in the world if I didn't live so far up north. Everything you want in a local divey place is here. Great bartenders, servers, music, prices, people ACTUALLY DANCING. I have never been to WT and not had a blast. Even the door guy is friendly! you know that old adage, come as strangers, leave as friends? well they own that at WT. Every time I come, I make new friends. It's just that type of place. Yes, it's crowded and yes, the bathrooms are tiny and scary. And yes, there's alot of drunk woo girls singing loudly to shitty top 40s songs. But so what? after 2 pint sized dark and stormys, you will join them. And that's A-ok as long as you're smiling and friendly! Love this bar and everyone that works there. A true gem but lets not shout about it. That bathroom line is long enough. There's a great story about how these bastard made me miss an international flight the next day but i'll tell ya that one at the bar. See you there!"
4976,"Advisable:1. Going to Whiskey Tavern.2. Playing board games in the backyard.3. Taking a spicy pickleback with friends.4. Hitting them up on Wednesday: it's Bowl of Ribs night ($12 pitchers of Miller Lite too)Inadvisable:1. Taking more than four picklebacks in a sitting.2. Adhering to all the instructions written on the Jenga blocks. One of them in particular reads, ""shit on a girl's face and tell her u luv her"", which in addition to being poorly written, also seems sort of contradictory in my world view. I can neither confirm nor deny if I've done any of the inadvisable things listed above."
4977,"Thursday evening after work summons tater tots and one drink for a brief escape.  At the threshold the tavern's bouncer requested to see photo identification before permitting me entrance.  Aaugh!, again ""Can I See Some Identification?"" and later responded ""you look good.""  I immediately sat at the bar counter without waiting and the male bar tender, John warmly welcomed with a smile and a hand shake.  Whoa! This is a first for me to receive such respect, positivity, aura of good energy and a sense of welcoming as it proves there are still good, kind people in this world.  John appears happy with his job servicing patrons attentively backed by previous Yelp reviews.  Without doubt I knew I desired tater tots but I've inquired about their Happy Hour menu.  Since I was in a whiskey tavern the selection of whiskey is extensive but it is a group involvement activity certainly no fun to shoot  libations alone.  Wine is not part of their Happy Hour but beer, Margarita and Cosmopolitan are included.  However, after taking a hiatus from mixed drinks for wine I desired a Margarita.  My server John is attentive, efficient and friendly who smiled blurting ""tots and Margarita, YAY!"" which became my dinner meal.  Upon departure he offered to shake my hand again and wished me Godspeed.  I gave him a very generous tip for his kindness, compassion, caring, respect, effective communication which is something fading from restaurants and bars.  While exiting the bouncer ironically stated ""next time you will not be carded"" which I managed to shoot a straight face as a response.  This bar offers reasonable priced food and quality drinks.  Yes, two giant TV screens are tacked to the bar's wall emitting sporting events.Margarita $7I decided a plain version (non flavored) with salt on the glass rim.  It was somewhat strong but good quality, which knocked me to sleep early. Tater tots $6Abundant in portion served with Sriracha with aioli dipping sauce on the size and arrived piping intense hot.  A basket platter full of my favorite version of potato enable joy and reminisce my childhood's elementary school lunch days.  The dipping sauce was very subtle which was a good pairing and enhances my experience for tots.  Still thinking of these tots and the accompanied sauce...Whiskey Tavern is located in Chinatown, Manhattan and is somewhat loud background music, but no rowdy patrons or staff member as it appears a controlled sustainable atmosphere.  I would surly return for pickle back whiskey shots and a burger.  Many happy returns at the end of the day!"
4978,"Hands down one of the coolest dive bars in NYC.Been here quite a few times, always had a great time here.The vibe here is really good , and that combined with awesome staff makes this place super cool. Whether it's lazy Sunday day drinking or celebrating a birthday..this spot makes a really good spot to host almost every occasion. Apart from great drinks, the food is also spot on. Bar grub is off the charts, and they have some great food & drink specials almost all days of the week.Definitely a must visit bar in China town!!"
4979,"Cute, quaint dive bar in the heart of Chinatown. Decent drink prices, good specials and friendly service make this spot a worthwhile visit.The drink selection was good and the cocktails were mixed well. The wings were to die for.Our server Alex was friendly, sweet and attentive. She went above and beyond for one member of our group who was celebrating a birthday. They brought out a complementary round of shots affixed with a candle and a happy birthday sign custom printed in color! It was a such a nice gesture, especially since we weren't even vocal about the birthday occasion. 5 stars, would recommend."
4980,"BEST birthday surprise! Last Saturday night, I had dinner at Forlini's close by with a large group at 6 pm. I then had a booth reserved for around 8 pm at Whiskey Tavern. When my group arrived, I was so surprised to see multiple custom signs. Our waitress gave me a free shirt as well! Thanks for a fun night, and for accommodating my group! I had a blast."
4981,"Dive bar?  No.Sports bar?  Yes.Good choice of food and drinks, quality is okay, pricing is fair.Staff and service were excellent.  Tables were sticky.I wouldn't rush back unless in the neighborhood."
4982,"Serioulsy fun. Came here on a random Friday night and met John aka the best bartender ever who clearly loves his job. We had a couple of pickle back shots (also, delicious!) and just soaked up the bumpin' vibes of this place. It's great to be at a bar where everyone is just in a good mood. Also seems like a fun place for parties (apparently the owner makes all the fun/funny cut out signs!) so will definitely be back!"
4983,Wonderfully friendly staff. Alex was super charming. Quick pit stop after Washington Square and before walking across Brooklyn Bridge.
4984,"Oh Whiskey Tavern. How I love you so. I've been going to this place for years, so don't hesitate to experience the magic of the Tav. Whiskey Rob who owns the place might be one of the best human beings I've ever met in my life. The type of guy that not only remembers you but truly does it all to keep you coming back. Their food is delicious my personal favorites are the fried pickles, always have to order a fresh basket of those every time. Usually followed by the famed pickle back which might not be your taste but nor was it mine when I first came 3 years ago. I'm lucky to say I'm a true regular at this place and to have a place where the staff treats you like family.It can definitely get packed on the weekends, so if you don't like crowds it may not be the place for you. However rather you're looking for an extended time with the homies or just pop in for a quick drink on a bar crawl. You will always get great service from the door guy, bartenders, and of course the man of every hour, Whiskey Rob"
4985,"I have never felt more welcome!!! Came solo from LA toNYC and was pleased to find the most helpful and kind staff a woman could ask for!!! When I DO come back to NYC, this will be my stop on my list without a doubt!!! And, if I can note, MARTY is the BEST!!!"
4986,"When my friend suggested that a group of us grab drinks at the nearby Whiskey Tavern I was intrigued.  He was a big fan of high-end bourbon and craft beers, so I totally trusted his beverage recommendations.  Once I walked into the bar, I had actually realized that I had been there about 8 or 9 years ago to see a friend play a guitar set.  There were no musicians playing on this particular evening, but it was still almost impossible to hear each other over the blaring music, making us wonder if we were just getting too old...While a total dive bar,  Whiskey Tavern had that friendly feeling of a neighborhood spot that catered to locals.  It also had an interesting menu full of custom cocktails and innovative brews.  I ordered one of their special seasonal beers, the Oyster Bay Pumpkin Ale.  This affordable bar shocked me by elevating my drink with a dusting of pumpkin sugar on the rim of the pint glass.  The beer, itself, was rich and pumpkin-y, without being syrupy or sweet.  The sugared ledge enhanced the brew's natural flavor essences.  Whiskey Tavern provided more than would initially meet the eye - unique beverages, fun patrons (there were at least 3 birthdays happening), and great service.  This was not what one would expect from what appeared to be a ""traditional"" dive bar."
4987,"I've been to Whiskey Tavern a handful of times, twice for a birthday and occasionally for happy hour. As with any good bar in NY, it is overcrowded during peak hours. It's a great escape from the pretentious vibe you often encounter at similar Manhattan establishments. They have board games and Jenga, and the DJ plays a variety of music ranging from old school pop to today's top 40s. Highlights:1. The bartenders (and most servers) are awesome2. Table reservations are free 3. PICKLE BACK"
4988,"I've been here a couple of times over the years for different occasions, ranging from a work event with 50+ guests, to birthday parties, or just random drop ins.There's a great mix in the clientele, a festive vibe, and drinks are served generously and at a great value. Football Sunday can get really intense, so I'd definitely recommend if you'd like to immerse yourself into a high energy crowd and buzzing setting!"
4989,"Some call this place Whiskey Tavern, I refer to it as heaven and pickle backs are my religion. I am forever faithful.Our love story started on one of my very first nights in NYC over 3 years ago with a quick search on Yelp for bars near my first apartment in Chinatown. Up came Whiskey Tavern, and it was a Tuesday no less so I stopped in for some tacos. Upon entering I was greeted with smiles from the bartenders, grabbed a seat, and instantly became best friends with my server, Rachel. From there, the rest is really history. I was hooked. I've laughed here, cried here, brought my parents here, celebrated birthdays, football games, Christmas in July, Thanksgiving, you name it. This is THE place for any kind of celebration, big or small. Rob goes above and beyond to make all of your dreams come true with personalized signs and plenty of whiskey. If you're STILL not convinced that this is the bar for you let me tell you about the time my mom and I celebrated Mother's Day here. Sarah the bartender fed my mom all the wine she had and brought out a cupcake for her at midnight with a little candle and we rallied the whole bar to wish her a happy Mother's Day at midnight.Personally, I love being there at about 11PM to see the shift change through the windows at Manhattan Detention Center across the street. Since there are often prison guards and government employees who frequent Whiskey Tavern, I definitely recommend chatting them up to learn more about our correctional system! They've got other locations, too (Whiskey Town, Whiskey Brooklyn, The Little Whiskey, The Big Whiskey, etc.) but honestly Whiskey Tavern is by far my favorite.If you haven't done so already, please make it a point to stop in for a truly religious awakening in Chinatown.XOXO"
4990,"Wow ! What can I begin to say about this bar! It's great. The service was out of this world. The food was great, bathrooms were clean and most importantly the staff and beers were ON POINT!! Had the pleasure of having Matt as our bartender and what a great dude. Super attentive, made conversation and was always making sure we were good. Tried the bowl o bacon, the barley soup, the bowl of pickles and the tater tots with cheese (amazing). AND PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, HAVE THE SPICY PICKLEBACKS!!! AMAZING. If you're in the area give this spot a chance !!!"
4991,"Marty is great, peaceful environment I will say this and I'm honest. If I lived here it would be my home bar cheers to them all. China town is China town and this bar fits perfectly im glad I landed here. Burger is grand and while it's not a ""whiskey bar"" its got a nice selection and good prices. Samantha C said it perfectly so Im going to plagiarize . "" Service here is top notch. Bartenders make sure you enjoy your experience, talkative, inviting. Or leave you alone if you want."""
4992,"WHISKEY TAVERN IS THE PLACE TO GO FOR ANY EVENT - birthday, work happy hour, pet's birthday, hump day, friend's cousin's dog's sister's graduation celebration... uh, low-key wedding?I normally don't like Irish bars, so when I first came to Whiskey Tavern for a friend's birthday, I wasn't expecting much but my God I was so shocked by the incredible service and it was truly one of the most fun birthdays I've been to. The music was awesome and the drinks were super affordable. So I decided to host a surprise birthday for my boyfriend here and e-mailed Rob and he was awesome to work with. There's no minimum spending or # of people I believe to reserve a spot. I  kept switching the amount of people, but Rob was nice and accommodating. I sent him a few funny photos of my boyfriend's face and it was hilarious seeing his face Photoshopped onto images with a ""happy birthday"" sign when we arrived. (It's also smart to have your face on the table YOU reserved when you come in and see randos in your corner who claim you're not the person that reserved it... ANYWAY.) My boyfriend also got a Whiskey Tavern shirt wrapped in foil which was a nice surprise. The service is absolutely amazing. The bouncers, bartenders, and servers... everyone. You never get this kind of service in bars. Everyone genuinely seems happy to be working here and is so much fun. I believe it was Alex who was the one who served us during the birthday who was SO much fun and SO nice, and last year it was Tali (?) - not sure if she still works here. Can't wait to come back when everything goes back to normal, but hope the Whiskey Tavern team is doing well."
4993,"Dis da best place to go for your birthdayFree banners, free shirts, and free shots for your partayCame here with 12 or so folksThe hospitality and the good vibes are no jokeThe shots were just the icing on the cakeSo much bourbon, they could make a whiskey lake5 Stars like it's part of God's Plan; DrakePut this bar on your list and get a grip; handshake."
4994,"Such a fun bar!My friends and I went here for a few hours while trying to kill time before dinner. We went on Christmas Day evening and the place was so fun and lively!Seating, understandably, was hard to come by. Luckily, we were able find a seat for our party of six after about 30 min. Drinks were good, priced on par with NYC prices. We ordered fries, which were so so good. We didn't order any other food.Bartenders were so fun and friendly! Very jolly and festive for the day. The music was so good, a bunch of fun throwback music. Definitely want to check this bar out again the next time I'm in the area. They also had really good daily specials and happy hour."
4995,"The good: $7 spicy pickle back shotsFriendly bartender (I want to say his name was John) The bad: the place reeks so badly of stale sickly-vomit that it's hard to enjoy your drink. Improper Guinness pours. Loud, crowded, no where to stand without feeling like you're in the way Update: ahh f%#* it, I love whiskey tavern. Went here almost every Friday while I was in culinary school and it's an awesome dive bar. Bartenders are awesome. Picklebacks shots are the best around. I'll miss this place."
4996,"Great happy hour deals for every day of the week. Great vibes and FYI you will not find your contemporary pop songs here, songs are mostly country/pop songs from the 90's but that's what makes this place unique! HUGE portions of food. So worth and so good. They gave our group shots on the house to welcome us ""new friends"", so sweet of them. Only been here twice but see myself coming back for more!"
4997,Very cool spot to drop into after an evening outThe staff was awesome and the bartender on top of his gameWould like to try the food on a subsequent trip back but would highly recommend this place for beer wine and cocktails at anytime
4998,"Met a friend from out-of-town (who use to be a local) and eight of her other companions for drinks here last weekend. The bartender was great (gave me a handshake and introduced himself), and I lucked out with grabbing a seat at the bar. As for the drinks? Strong! They also had a pretty solid music playlist going that we thoroughly enjoyed. Just note that it can get quite packed, you'll be yelling at your friends to be heard over the music, and the crowd here is pretty young."
4999,"Popped in for a couple of beers after a night out as this was round the corner to our hotel. It was busy and loud which was excellent, lots of screens showing sports and great service. Went back a couple of times, always good."
5000,"I am not really a sandwich person. I never go for a sandwich when I'm hungry but this place has completely changed my mind.  The sandwiches here are INSANE. I go in, place my order then pay. I was shocked when my total came out to $24 for a sandwich. But then my sandwich came out....it's almost the size of a newborn. I can eat a lot but this was definitely a sandwich I spread across two meals. Beautiful cross section of super fresh ingredients, crispy bread and deliciousness. My first time there I got the spicy chicken parm. It came with chicken cutlets, soppressata, mozzarella parm and tomato sauce. Chicken was moist, mozzarella was super fresh and the soppressata was amazing. My second time I got the chicken mozzarella and pesto. Just as good. This is definitely going to be a weekly stop for me. 100% worth the price tag."
5001,"I haven't had Faiccos in about 7 years. When I lived close by, I would come here often! So when I came to visit nyc, this was a must do on my list. Most of the sandwiches are 20$. However, they really are massive and at least 2 meals for one person. I was sad to find out they do not offer half sandwiches, since I wasn't particularly starving when I got the sandwich. I couldn't get the Italian or roast beef sandwich this time around, but did encourage my husband to try them. He got the Italian and it was loaded with cured meats and toppings! I opted for the eggplant parm sandwich - which was tasty and came with melted mozzarella and some marinara sauce as well. I will continue to recommend faiccos but will emphasize to come here when hungry, or to find someone to split a sandwich with, or to have a refrigerator close by for left overs."
5002,"This place just didn't knock my socks off. And for $20 per sandwich, that's really what I would expect. I hate to only give 3 stars for what looks like an authentic Italian shop full of character and characters...but it's all I can muster.Ordered an Italian. The sandwich is large, and comes with a healthy amount of meat and fresh tasting ingredients, but the flavors are just mild...and kind of all blend together. Also, why only serve a massive sandwich for $20? Why not a smaller sandwich or half sandwich in addition to the gigantic one that one person would struggle to eat? I was only able to eat half, and just felt like the other half simply wasn't worth it, and to me, that speaks volumes."
5003,"For my first trip from Virginia to Manhattan in 4 years, I needed a good Italian deli. It's a small shop in the village, no tables, chairs, or counters. But they have two walls of great groceries plus two deli cases of meats, cold cuts, and the like. I paid 20 bucks for an Italian sub with Genoa salami, prosciutto, mortadella, fresh mozz, lettuce, tomato, and roasted peppers on a crusty semolina seeded roll. There are no rolls like them outside of the New York metro area. And this sandwich had about three times as much meat and cheese as it did vegetables! Half a sandwich and I was good. My friend enjoyed the chicken cutlet, mozz, and broccoli rabe.We even saw they had the prosciutto bread, which is basically a meat bagel. That became a spicy delicious dessert. Not cheap and it would be nice to have room for a chair or two, but the quality of food is top notch."
5004,I dream about their Italian sandwich. By far one of the best I've ever had. And they are pricey but you definitely get your money's worth because the sandwiches are HUGE. They are as big as a baby. I got the chicken parm and the Italian sandwich. I would definitely get both again. Wish I had side of warm marinara to dip that chicken parm sandwich in.
5005,"Italian special was a hefty sandwich, definitely enough to feed 2 people! Line moved quickly with people calling out numbers in order."
5006,"This is the best sandwich I've ever had. They slice the meats fresh, right when you order, all of the topping just make sense, the bread is sturdy enough to hold the hero, but soft enough to bite through without worrying about your teeth.These sandwiches are hearty, and should most definitely be shared. If you're around, definitely stop by, pay cash if possible, and you'll be in for a treat."
5007,"When a friend told me I needed to get a ""Chicken Parm"" from an Italian deli when visiting New York I wasn't quite sure what I was in for or necessary what that even entailed. Safe to say his recommendation was spot on and Faicco's Italian Specialties knocked it out of the park.This place was buzzing when we wandered in on a Friday afternoon but they moved through the line quickly. Have your order ready when you hit the front of the line otherwise you may get some friendly encouragement from the queue behind you.Their sandwiches are ""yuugggeee"" and unless you have a huge appetite or want to have seconds later on it is worth considering splitting with a friend.On to the coveted Chicken Parm... it was outstanding! 3 tiers of seasoned and breaded flattened chicken breast, a really nice marinara, slices of fresh mozz and of course grated Parm come together on a seeded hoagie bun to make one amazing and truly New York sandwich experience.Make sure to grab a drink from the cooler when you walk in and grab one of the many other Italian specialties in the case when you order your hoagie.Magnifico!"
5008,"though $18 for a sandwich IS a steep price, here is why it is worth:we got the chicken parm. it was SO GOOD. the bread was thin but crunchy. the chicken was plentiful (three pieces) and soft and not dry at all. the marinara sauce was well seasoned and not too sweet or sour. also, we shared one and it was fine for our stomachs! tbh it just was an experience too. the cramped space was quite a show."
5009,"Oversized and expensive Italian sandwiches in the West Village. This was a highly oversized experience that makes you think you are getting a good deal when in fact you are not.The meats are delicious, there is no denying that. I believe the issue lies within the bread. It tastes stale and melds in too much with the sandwich. Like the best sub shops, the secret to a great sub is the bread. If it is delicious, the rest of the sandwich elevates to another plane of greatness. If it lacks, the whole sandwich falls apart quickly.That is what happens here.If not for the bread this would be a four, maybe a five star review. Instead, I deduct points because you need good bread to make it work; they failed here.Try Pisillo in FiDi over this one and you will see what I mean."
5010,"Look at this meat in the muffuletta hero!!! Yes, it may cost you a few extra dollars, but this sub is HUGE. Best sandwich/sub place you'll find in NYC. Go try it!"
5011,"I had the roast beef sandwich with bacon and cheddar. There was a generous portion of cold, under cooked roast beef (there was blood on the bread). The texture was unpleasant with warm crispy bacon. Further, the man at the front door was not wearing a mask (though very friendly) and greeted every person that entered the store. Not worth $18 a sandwich."
5012,Chicken pesto sandwich is up there with top sandwiches in NYCAlso can't go wrong with the chicken parm and Italian hero
5013,Really great sandwiches but found plastic in the sandwich the second time I ordered it.
5014,The sandwiches here were so good!  I got the chicken cutlet and the Italian.  Both were amazing and would be ordered again.  The service was great and felt authentic.  I will be back next time I am in the area for sure.
5015,"We were in the mood for Italian sandwiches and ended up here on a Saturday afternoon. Only permits six people at a time for safety measures given the current pandemic. We ordered two sandwiches ($15 each):  the chicken, mozzarella and pesto and the chicken parm on a whole wheat hero. You can easily share one sandwich between two people given the generous portion. We loved both of our sandwiches and will be coming here soon!"
5016,"Faicco's is a Village institution and has been so for over 100 years. They've been doing something right and it shows.Inside there's wall to wall displays filled with perfectly butchered meat ready for your Nonna's Sunday sauce, American and Italian cold cuts, fresh cheeses, and Italian specialties. On my most recent visit I had to get me a salami and mozzarella hero. The bread was typical Italian bread you'd find in an Italian deli and was fresh. Everything moves quick in this place and doesn't sit around. My hero was loaded with about half a pound of meat and cheese and was generously topped with red peppers. $14 for my hero and I could barely manage to eat it all.I will warn you though when you enter a place like this it is very easy to spend with your eyes and go overboard so try not to go too hungry!"
5017,"there is a reason this place usually has a line out the door. it is INSANE. i've only tried their sandwiches though they offer other italian fare and groceries. the chicken cutlet, pesto, mozz sandwich is to die for. three chicken cutlets are more than enough to fill you for the day. & the italian sandwich is out of this world. good luck trying to wrap your mouth around either sandwich but you'll be glad you did."
5018,"We came here because we were looking into some sausages to get for our pasta. The place was a bit crowded as they were having buy 1 get 1 free on some of their cakes from the holidays. Normally when you enter you can get a number and they will call it, but when we went I guess it was less crowded than usual as we just went up and ordered.We got a pound or so (~6 sausages) of the Sweet Italian Plain Sausage. There is a spicy version and one with fennel which we'll probably have to try out next time. After we brought it home and cooked it, the sausage tasted of pretty good quality, equivalent to the ones you can get at Trader Joe's, though a little milder on the taste.Will probably be back some time and try the different sausages as well as the sandwiches! Sandwiches seemed like the most popular ordered item."
5019,"Best sandwiches in NYC. No higher praise than that. Quality meats, cheeses, toppings, and bread. Huge. Made right."
5020,"- the staff are all attentive and charming- the sandwiches are enough for at least a couple of meals (making the cost worth it) - will certainly be back to pick up some of their fresh made sausage and the meatball parm - tried the italian ($18) and the american ($15), both piled high with quality ingredients on soft chewy bread- prices range from around $15-20, depending on the sandwich"
5021,Love this place. The staff was awesome. If you're ever in NYC stop by for sure. You won't be disappointed.
5022,"This place has great subs, incredible rice balls, and the best imported selection. Taking one star off since last time I went my sub had some 'bad' chicken- it had that glossy look when the meat is spoiled and undercooked. First time in 12 years that I got bad food."
5023,"Fantastic place. Quick service, amazing prices and don't discriminate on race, sex, creed, or elective medical procedures ;). Stay woke"
5024,Good Service.Great Sandwich. Mostly Meat & Pretty Big.Worth $15? Not Really But Its Cool To Try Once. I Would Go Back. I Love Sandwiches.
5025,This place has incredible Italian sandwiches. They also don't discriminate against their customers. This is an amazing establishment all around and other businesses should take note.
5026,"Great Italian specialty shop in the heart of the village! The food is fresh and delicious, the staff is fast and friendly, and the overall experience is great. I go for the sandwiches... they are pricey, mind you, but you get what you pay for- a gigantic sandwich that is up there with the best sandwiches I've had. One of my go tos is roast turkey with fresh mozz, pesto, and hot peppers. It is mind blowing. But the thing is, you can't really go wrong with anything! If you love sandwiches, take a trip to Faicco's! You'll thank me later!"
5027,"Waited in line a couple weekends back to grab hoagies (subs, whatever) and walk the high line. We tried a hot chicken parm and a classic Italian cold cut and WOW THESE ARE HUGE. Def lasted for 2 meals... and while the chicken parm was good, it was a little drier than I'd hoped, and so because of that, the Italian meats won my heart. But seriously there were so many options that I will absolutely be back next time I'm craving a good old Italian hoagie."
5028,"This place was the WINNER for the food portion of our 2019 trip.When I lived in California, I used to go this little Italian market every weekend and shop a bit, buy a sandwich from the counter, talk to the meat guys, who got to know me over time. When I moved back to DFW it was one of the things I missed the most. We don't have anything like that here. Which is why I was so deeply happy to stumble upon Faicco's while researching NYC food. Because Faicco's is that place, but ten times better, because New York.The store itself is everything I want out of an Italian market - fabulous selection, super friendly and helpful counter guys who obviously care about their work, items you can't find anywhere else. If I lived there, you better believe I would be there every weekend, stocking up.But alongside the market goods, they also have a large sandwich menu with some of the best sandwiches I have ever had in my life. And I am SUCH a sandwich person. This was bliss. Italian special (perfection, and not overly oily or vinegary!), chicken parm (three massive pieces of chicken in there!), meatball parm (ugh the meatballs!). We also tried a stromboli (delicious), spinach stuffed bread (omg so much spinach, hooray!), prosciutto ball and rice ball (mmmm balls).Everything was... I don't have the superlatives. We went on Sunday and had to come back on Wednesday to try more - and I still missed out on ordering an Italian parm. I would have killed to taste their in-house Italian sausage. An oversight to correct next time - and there will be a next time because I can promise you I will go here every time I am in NYC.This place is the best and I will be raving about it place for a long, long time to come. Faicco's I love you.(Side note: the prices for the sandwiches may seem high but trust me, I am A BIG EATER and even I could only eat half at one meal. So this is a two-meal price you're looking at on the board. Worth it!)"
5029,Get the Italian sub. Best I've ever had. Actually big enough for two people. The most satisfying sandwich.
5030,"We walked in on a Friday night and it looked packed! Nevertheless, we were able to be seated immediately at a table all the way in the back. It was a little dark in the restaurant, but it matched the mood that I think the restaurant was going for. We had a dozen oysters, Bulgolgi buns, Pork belly, soy garlic wings, tuna tartare, tiger roll, Bulgolgi tacos, and the Beeline cocktail. My favorite was the tuna tartare! They serve bread on the side that you use to dip into the tartare. Drinking Beeline, a lavender infused vodka drink, was also interesting. The waiters were nice, but it seemed like they couldn't get back to us in a timely matter because the restaurant was busy. It took a while to finally flag a waiter down and get the bill. Overall, it is a good place to get korean food in the Union Square area."
5031,Came here for brunch with my girlfriends. I apparently didn't take photos of the food because I was so hungry and it was so good! We had the crunchy tofu with spicy sauce and the seafood Korean pancakes to start. I was expecting the pancakes to be thinner...these were a little thicker than I expected but still good. Packed with filling and had a great sauce to go with it. We all had the sizzling stone bowls for our mains. I tried the bulgogi and my friends had the spicy pork. Both were excellent! The hot stone bowl crisps up the rice a bit for an extra layer of texture with every bite.
5032,"4.5Came on a Saturday afternoon (12:30 pm) and the inside was pretty empty, maybe 2-3 more parties. By the time I left at 1:30, definitely more people came in. I ordered the wings (soy & garlic) and the Tiger roll. Honestly, I'm really impressed. 6 wings came out & the breading tasted really good, the chicken was definitely meaty..but I feel like I got sick of the marinade/flavor after 3 wings so I'd definitely recommend them to be shared. Then I had the Tiger Roll which was AMAZING. Literally every single bite was a new flavor & the sauce they serve with it is beyond refreshing and perfect for the roll. I can see why it's one of their signature dishes. Otherwise, the ambiance of the restaurant is beautiful & the service was really good too. Only other thing is that the prices are quite steep but I think it's worth it for some menu items. But definitely keep the huge price in mind! I loved being able to finally check out Barn Joo!"
5033,"We had a lovely lunch and enjoyed the sunshine at Barn Joo. We split a few dishes and had a cocktail. The fried calamari was crispy and tender. The roll was mouth watering and I want more of it. The bun was all very good and we ate it so fast we didn't get a picture. It was a nice day to sit outside, the place was at Union Square but it felt secluded and relaxing. Overall, lovely lunch. Would go back again."
5034,"This is my fav Barn Joo besides the Barn Joo 35 one. Everything I get here is always so PERFECT! Yesterday I came here with my colleague and we ordered: Definitely need to come back sooner! Fish Baos 5/5 DELICIOUS every single time I've gotten this. The fish is fried soo good and the flavor it has is superb! It almost tastes like a fish Big Mac bao Soy Garlic Chicken Wings 5/5 Staple Korean food! Fried really well, and very delicious! Nicely paired with the hot sauce Shrimp Udon Pasta 5/5 Flavor was so delicious, shrimp tasted so good, and everything was SUPERB. The oysters inside of the pasta were not fishy, and were also very soft. The sauce was creamy, and the additional crunch on top of the pasta elevated the entire experience!"
5035,"Barn Joo's is such a surprising place. Based on how it looks outside, i would of never expected to walk into such a large space. Its so beautiful in here. I'm obsessed with the decor, colors and the way they choiced to set things up. They have dividers in place and shields to section off the tables. There's different seating. I've been lucky enough to try it all. Each time you get a different view of the restaurant and its beautiful from every angle.They offer indoor and outdoor dining. In order to sit inside you must be vaccinated and show proof. They do check here.I've come here three times for lunch. It's never been packed. There's usually people but not an obscene amount. I've even seen people WORKING here, with their laptops and papers up, etc. Its legit very peaceful here. I would recommend it to anyone looking for some peace and solitude for a few minutes. I'm not sure how it is at other times but between 12:30 to 2pm, its nice and quite.The service in here has been great. I cannot complain. During my first visit i did feel like the waitress took a while to acknowledge me but once I ordered and got my items she seemed really attentive. That particular day there was a few people in the restaurant. At least five to six tables filled. During my second visit i was in there alone for the first 15mins. Then two tables were occupied. The service was 1 on 1 so no complaints here. It was great. My third time here great as well. The service was quick.Each time I come i always get Oysters. They taste fresh and are really tasty. You can't beat the $1.75 price. I have also gotten the shrimp cocktail. I have tried the steamed buns with beef. I liked them but it was a little dry. It needed more sauce. I also dont think the quinoa was needed. It got stuck in my teeth and just didnt help. But i loved the pickles veggies on the side. So good. Overall i love it here and I'll continue to visit. I highly recommend it. The service has always great and so has the food."
5036,"This place has been on my list for a while. My friends and I loved the food! I got the Bee Line during happy hour. Can't say it was my favorite. The lavender taste was quite strong. Other than that, the food was amazing!"
5037,"I have to leave a new review for this location. I have been to the 35th street one pre pandemic.This location is bigger and able to adhere to spacing requirements.It's easy to get too. As a matter fact, I have passed this place by several times and did not know it was here.We had dinner reservations for 6 people. It was Friday night and the restaurant didn't feel super crowded. We had those Plexiglass dividers between our table and the next. It was nice because it added a bit of privacy for each patron.My friend took the liberty of ordering for the table. Everything was wonderful. I remembered some of the items from years back but there were a few new things we didn't have before.My favorites were prob the Tuna Tartare dish, tacos (I believe we had thr Bulgogi), I enjoyed the Japchae this time around, and fried asparagus.Only thing I would add is they beef up their tea supply. It was winter and we wanted some after dinner tea or coffee but they weren't really equipped for all that. They gave us some tea bags but it was like meh. But they tried. The waiter said they use to have more offerings but it wasn't a big hit I guess.Oh can't forget dessert. The churro and ice cream was the best out of the 3. Other was bread pudding and chocolate mousse type cake. Good but the churro was the best."
5038,"Once again they are packed!!! I was seated immediately to a high top table so it wasn't too bad! I came here before pandemic and remember their drinks being absolutely amazing! It still is! I just didn't come to their happy hour this time; make sure you do! They have a great selection of cocktails for happy hour for a better price! I tried their bulgogi rice cakes this time and it was BOMB!!! However, they definitely cheaped out on the truffle fries and the soy garlic wings were not fully marinated through. Otherwise, it's a great place with a group of friends for a variety of Korean small plates and bbq!!"
5039,"Nice fusion gastropub in Union Square Overall: 4/5 Food: 4.5/5Drinks: 4/5 Value: 4/5 Shared a number of dishes here including the bibimbap ($22), tiger roll ($11 for 4 pieces), galbi jjim / braised short ribs ($38). Many of the dishes are Korean or fusion; flavors were quite good and portion sizes were big. Prices were a bit on the higher side for comparable food at other spots but portions size were good to compensate a bit. Had the Beeline drink and it was good but not outstanding. Overall nice spot with chill gastropub vibes."
5040,"was really excited for here. Great atmosphere. happy hour wasn't the best deal (drinks $12) but I appreciated that it existed on the weekend. absolutely loved the drink Charlie Collins.  we ordered some cold apps of shrimp and oysters, an order of chicken wings which were good but not spectacular, and then the short ribs (amazing) and seafood stew (pretty tasty) The portions were appropriate for one person however I would say the prices were rather high for what you got. Service was prompt but one of those situations where you were dealing with multiple servers and didn't really have a consistent one"
5041,"Pretty decent place to grab drinks and food with friends! Even during happy hours, prices are still pretty high ): Service was okay; they accidentally gave us a dish we didn't order and took it away later, but they did check up on us pretty frequently. Food was decent! Really enjoyed the fries and uni bibimbap, but definitely the portion sizes were smaller than we expected.. Thought it was interesting that the army stew had cheese, which gave a creamier texture compared to the usual Korean stews that have a kick and spice to it. The cocktails were pretty good and it is very spacious inside!"
5042,Great Korean food spot with a mix of KBBQ that you cook at your table and an extensive standard dinner menu. We got a whole bunch of appetizers to share and the food came out quickly and was super tasty!
5043,Wow! Between the Uni bibimbap and oysters I will definitely be back again for both these dishes! Also the interior design of this restaurant is super woodsy and got a really nice ambiance to it! Thanks Barn Joo! I'll be back soon :)
5044,"Headed to the Banksy exhibit and decided on lunch beforehand. I love  coming here for the tuna burrito. It's still as good as ever! It's a large portion-see photo. It comes with their delicious truffle fries and a free soda. They are taking excellent covid precautions; staff all wearing masks, seats separated by plastic shields (whatever that's worth-but at least they are trying!) I appreciate all the precautions. My Diet Coke was fresh and not flat. (Hey-all of it matters lol!) My craving for a tuna burrito was satisfied! Thank you and happy new year!"
5045,"Great spot we found while walking back after doing some sight seeing . We stopped by for some drinks and appetizers . The drinks were delicious, highly recommend ! I got a margarita , we also tried cooked octopus that was very impressive and highly recommend . Would love to go back and check out the rest of their menu!"
5046,"Came here for HH, it's a beautiful space, food was very tasty, love the bar area, the price is a little higher than the most HH places, over all it was great."
5047,"Had bulgogi bibimbap as lunch take out. It's the special purple rice. Generous portion of the beef. Need to add more flavor tho. Without the sauce, it's a little blend. But overall very good dish. Staff is very helpful and friendly. Def will come back to try other items."
5048,"Food was really good! We got the bibimpap with tofu, crunchy tofu, and shishito peppers with mushroom. I am vegetarian, and this place was super accommodating! Not something I find all the time haha :') We also barely made it on time for happy hour (thank you to our server for letting us know) and ordered the drink, Bee Line. Overall super fun place to grab some small bites!"
5049,"We called to make a reservation for a group of 8 on a Friday night and were easily accommodated! Barn Joo is and fun and trendy place near union square with Korean-inspired dishes. Unfortunately, service was extremely slow, and we waited nearly an hour after ordering our food and had to check in with a waiter to see where our orders were. The truffle fries, braised short ribs, and Korean army stew were delicious. However, one person in our group ordered the marinated chicken bbq and received unseasoned, plain raw chicken. Other KBBQ restaurants traditionally have servers who cook your meat for you, so we were a little shocked to see this at Barn Joo, given the high price point and small portion sizes.The interior was pretty loud and tables were packed, so patrons had to shout to be heard."
5050,"We were looking for a place to eat dinner at and called the restaurant in advance to see if we could be seated. Thankfully, we were eating a early dinner ~6PM and were able to be seated immediately after arrival. When we called ahead, the server had mentioned at 7PM, the restaurant would be packed and that was true. For three people, we ordered a large pork kbbq combo and crunchy tofu. The crunchy tofu was delicious. Even though their numbers were small, it packed a flavorful punch! I loved how crunchy the tofu was, even after sitting in the sauce for the whole duration of us barbecuing meat. Wished there were more! The meat was good quality and I really enjoyed the assortment of meats that came with the combo. The banchans on the side were also a nice touch. The combo even comes with steamed egg and corn cheese! Unfortunately you can't get refills on those but other banchans were able to be refilled as needed. Our server was very attentive and we had a wonderful time eating our fill. Overall pricey meal but you get what you pay for!"
5051,"I went to Barn Joo for dinner and ordered the Japchae with Bulgogi. The Japchae noodles were some of the chewiest that I've ever had (in a good way). Aside from the noodles, the rest of the dish was pretty standard. It could have used a bit more Bulgogi. The $25 price seemed kind of steep for this one dish.The restaurant itself is decorated tastefully with an interesting wall of ropes separating the first floor tables from the bar area. The lighting is a little dim to give a slightly more intimate atmosphere, though it can get a bit loud because of the number of other customers dining in (I was there on a Saturday night). The service speed is fast and the staff members were friendly and very attentive.Overall, Barn Joo is a great spot for Korean food, located right next to Union Square Park. I would definitely recommend it if you're looking for Korean food in the area."
5052,The drinks are definately strong and good. They also look beautiful. I would not say the food was bad but just not my taste. It had a weird combination for me. I ordered the braised short rib which comes in a cast iron pan . However it was cold which was very odd because the did take a long time to come but ofcourse like everywhere else I'm sure they are understaffed and it was a Wednesday night. The waiter took the food back to heat it up once I told him it was cold which was great. My boyfriend ordered the pork belly and he said he liked it and it was good. Besides that it was a cool place. Cool ambiance and decor. Waiter was also great and helped with our pictures. I might give it a second chance one day and try something else.
5053,"Delicious, well sectioned out , spacious , clean and great service . Highly recommend food is fusion twist to it but it is descent to authentic Korean and has the swag to meet up with your buds live everywhere , trains off union square plusMM"
5054,Let's just talk about the service ! 100 out of 100!The apps if you love Umatilla the mushrooms are out of this world. And the tuna cones why not. But be sure to top it off with the lychee martini and lavender cocktail
5055,Garlic soy chicken and calamari are excellent. Bibimbap was so-so. Cute dark place good for drinks & semi loud distracting music.
5056,"The food here was absolutely bomb! The service was less so, but honestly that didn't ruin the experience. The cocktails were super good, we also got an entrée to share, which was the octopus and it was just absolutely to die for! All of the meat we ordered was great and we cooked that well, but my favorite was definitely the shrimp. I would highly recommend going to this spot, and almost anything on the menu was delicious, we also got one roll that was done very well, so I would recommend the sushi too. Try and make a reservation at this place gets very busy"
5057,"Barn Joo serves more modern, fusion Korean cuisine compared to more traditional-style restaurants such as Her Name is Han or BCD. The Union Square location has two floors, with the second dedicated to Korean BBQ, but we opted to go for share plates instead. For three people, we had two tapas, one main, and one noodle dish. We had initially thought the portions were meager, but were surprisingly full at the end of the meal. My favorite dish of the night was the Bulgogi Spicy Rice Cake. The rice cakes were deep-fried to give a crunchy layer that was a perfect foil to the chewy interior. The gochujang gave the beef and onions a sweet and spicy kick, while the kabocha squash was a sweet side. Korean Army Stew came in a medium-sized stone bowl filled with ramen, spam, vegetables, and topped with melted mozzarella cheese. The melted cheese gave the overall broth a creamier texture compared to traditional Korean stews. Japchae and Popcorn Chicken were more standard fare, albeit still enjoyable."
5058,I came here on a Monday night because I heard good things about this place. I made it to happy hour which ends at 6:30pm. I saw the reviews posted on this place in this specific location on Yelp to get ideas on what to order. I ordered the following for happy hour: Beeline cocktail and Charlie Collins cocktail at $12 each. For food I order the Tiger Roll appetizer $11 and braised short ribs $37. Both dishes were to die for and so worth getting. I took the other half of the braised short ribs home to go. To end the evening I had to try the bread pudding which was the icing on the cake. The bread pudding is a must get. I was so full that I took the other half home minus the ice cream. The next day my other half devoured the bread pudding and wants me to replicate the dish. Service was also great. This place is worth going to because they have a prettier outdoor dining ambiance. Happy hour is worth checking out if you can make it before 6:30pm.
5059,"I feel like for a few years, this place was synonymous with the trendiest Korean food in the city (perhaps second only to Her Name Is Han and Take31). Unfortunately I think I have come here too late when they have succumbed to being a faded gem. Definitely not terrible but something of a disappointment.In terms of vibe, the outdoor seating is fairly bare bones, nothing extravagant. At the time of writing the interior had reopened as well, but did not quite live up to the ""clubby"" atmosphere advertised. Service was somewhat slow and inattentive.We ordered the scallion pancake, spicy tofu, and tteok with cheese. Tteok with cheese was the best - basically Mac and cheese with tteok substituted for pasta. The spicy tofu was a bit one note with the gochujang glaze and not much by way of texture contrast. They accidentally gave us a seafood pancake instead of scallion (I'm vegetarian) - I had a bite before realizing, it was just alright."
5060,"What a delicious and unexpected find on union Square. My husband and I enjoyed a lunch of tuna tartare and a sashimi bowl . The sashimi bowl was like a piece of surrealist art. Taste: phenomenal. Service was ... great, when it came. Note: We were unprepared with the touch-free payment and using a credit card took too much time."
5061,"My work team and I came here for dinner after a team building event. This is definitely a hip Korean restaurant that has 2 floors. There is a bar on the first floor and dining tables on the second floor. The chicken wings in soy garlic and hot & spicy and the truffle are delicious. I enjoyed the Umi Bibimbop. My colleagues loved the paella. The cocktails are great as well - try Beeline, Charlie Collins and Anejo Old Fashioned. I would definitely recommend Barn Joo for dinner with friends & family."
5062,"Everything here was really good. Came out fast and hot, we got the chicken wings, the sweet potato noodles with veggies, and fried pancake with veggies. It was all tasty, the noodles had an umami taste, couldn't stop eating those, the pancake was surprisingly good. Thought it would be sweet but it was savory and big, enough for two people. Also got eel roll which was also good"
5063,"Pretty decent Korean fusion joint in Union Square. Service was very good and the food was enjoyable as well. We ordered Fishermen's Noodle, Stonebowl Bibambap with Bulgogi and one the more strangely composed restaurant meals I've ever eaten, and I've eaten jellied duck tongues. Korean Army Stew...and I believe te recipe came from an army mess crew running out of options at the end of the week...basically a empty the pantry dish. It had sausage and sliced ham, rice and ramen noodles with beef broth, add kimchi and baked beans, top with melted cheese and an over easy fried egg. Obviously, I have a decent food tolerance and sense of culinary adventure...but it wasn't bad, strange composition but alright...like the Korean army mess crew tried to make their version of an British  breakfast without having ever been to the UK."
5064,Yukgaejang ramen was full of flavor with a kick. Good portion of meat and veggies in the bowl. Could have used a little more noodles. Broth itself was satisfying.Slower service than usual but server was kind and checked on the kitchen without my asking when the table beside mine got appetizers and drinks then started moving to additional dishes without a thing in sight for me.
5065,"Awesome service and solid food. We had reservations for dinner on a friday night for outdoor dining. The tables are a LITTLE close but they did temperature checks and they provided hand sanitizer at every table. The rundown:Crunchy tofu - fried tofu with spicy sauce. Nice crunch, sauce isn't too spicy. it's got a sweet and spicy flavor profile. tasty!Fried asparagus - good texture, large asparagus spears and yummy dipping sauce. The portion felt a bit small considering the cost $13 for about 5 pieces. Uni Bibimbap - big portion, lots of different veggies and pickles. Nice addition with the egg on top. Wish there was more uni, but I can never have enough of uni... Braised short ribs - fall off the bone short ribs with pine-nuts, chestnuts, mushroom, peppers, squash, and a bowl of rice. They give a lot of meat in this entree. Can definitely share it. Love how homey this dish feels with the veggies and bowl of rice. yum!Bourbon bread pudding - this is some of the best bread pudding i've ever had. I'm not a fan of soggy bread pudding, and this place does it right. It's got a crunch on some pieces on the edge, with good density to slop up the ice cream and bourbon sauce. needs a bit more blackberries or other fruit to brighten up the dessert but overall, delish!"
5066,"Cozy atmosphere with decent Korean-American fare. The rustic interior and high bar walls are truly a sight to see! My party appreciated how quickly the staff seated and served us throughout our stay.We ordered the large beef combo (prime short ribs / skirt steak / ribeye / marinated short ribs) and bulgolgi japchae. We're generously served endless banchan on the side and 3 sauces (soy / miso / salt). Every cut of meat was tender to the bite and paired so well with any side dish. The only issue - underwhelming portion size.Given that I'm from out of state and native to other koreatown's, the price point of the beef combo ($139) rivals that of high-end Japanese grills or 4 people at all-you-can-eat Kbbq. If price of food isn't a concern, then the ambiance will surely meet its worth."
5067,"I mean, if you're in the city and are in the mood for some bougie, uniquely plated Korean food, then this is your type of eatery.Decor is beautiful but they've got some serious Manhattan prices. $22+ for lunch special items is usually a little steep for me but I was in Union Square on business so, luckily I was able to expense it.My coworkers and I had:Uni Bibimbap - plated in a typical Korean doshirak (lunch box) tin box which made no sense. You're not able to shake it which is the whole point. They ended up mixing it with their metal spons which made a lot of clanging sound. There wasn't much seasoning and the Uni taste was really strong but had a lot of fresh veggies.Sashimi bibimbap - again, came in a tin box that you can neither shake to mix nor enough room to mix freely (typically served in a large bowl with high sides so you can mix the damn thing!). I think this was much tastier than thr Uni bibimbap. Burger - this was a delicious American burger. Nothing Korean about it but came with a spicy aoli sauce and crispy truffle fries.Seafood pajeon - $24 for this appetizer which we were told would come out first but came when we had already started our meal so a lot of our party didn't even touch.Flavor was good and the burgers came with its own homemade hibiscus lemonade which was really good but may go to K-Town for some good Korean food.Service was good and were waited on promptly but it took a little time for the food to come but we arrived after rush hour lunch.Giving it 4 stars for ambience, fancy plating and some of the dishes were really tasty."
5068,"We went for HH (4-7pm). Though it's not a fantastic deal. But hey, any money saved is still money saved. The lavender cocktail is really good! The spicy Serrano margarita is one of the spiciest margaritas I've had in Manhattan. They have oysters at this location! It's not necessarily the case at the other locations. Prices are on par with other Korean restaurants, though it's kinda small portions here. Think: upscale and modern bar. The spicy Korean fried chicken wings were good (7.5/10). Not the best I've had but it's fried chicken, and it's crispy and spicy. No complaints. The tteok and cheese was really good. Basically Asian Mac and cheese. They say it's rice flour gnocchi in cheese sauce. And it's exactly that. Slightly chewier like mochi. Get this if you want comfort food. Truffle fries were good. It was what it was. Truffle oil and crispy fries. The sad thing is that I went for the Uni Bibimbap but they didn't have uni. So I guess I will have to go back to try that. Huge space and good ambiance. So definitely bring friends!"
5069,"My boyfriend and I stumped upon this place when we were tired and hungry, to a point we were about to break up. Then we sat here, ate some appetizers and some drinks, then we were happy again  Great ambience, very chill at the bar, decent appetizers. I would come here and chill again!"
5070,"I went to Barn Joo with a friend after work. We ordered the truffle fries, the tiger roll, and veggie japchai. The food and atmosphere was great, the only downside was the service. The service was very slow. Our food came out within 15-20 min of us ordering, but it took about 45 min to flag down a waiter for the check."
5071,"I come for BBQ this time. It is sad to see many businesses suffer from COVID 19. This restaurant used to be crowded most of the time. I never have BBQ at this place before. Normally I go for some small plates, oysters and drinks. After having BBQ my friends and I agreed that we are not crazy about taste and quality of meat. We have a small size beef combo. Service is ok but our waitress only come one in a while so we kindda wait long time to get something."
5072,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to eat for dinner and have drinks and I've been wanting to check this place out. We didn't need to make reservations and we were seated immediately. We had a high top table and it was not too crowded. If it was, you can tell the tables were spaced apart which I definitely appreciated. We got soju bottles (2), and ordered their wings and fries, and sushi. All the food was delicious and the servers were very nice. This is a kind of spot you would go to for happy hour, after work drinks, a weekend bar or a spot for a date. My boyfriend and I had a great time! I would love to come back here and try more on their menu."
5073,"This spot is a great date night or a nice location to have drinks and amazing food. Had a great time talking smack and enjoying these dishes. They have COVID check when entering and they have outside dinning. The old fashion drink was excellent... I'm definitely coming back here again. Live, love and laugh - Sha M."
5074,Really good place for happy hour and a quick bite. Randomly stopped by with my friend and had a great time enjoying the draft.Food was great! The spicy wings and truffle fries were a great combination. Highly recommend stopping by!
5075,"I like this place a lot. One of my dear friends took me here and treat me for birthday lunch. It was a beautiful day so we get to sit outside, but I peeked at the interior as I went to the bathroom and it was nice too. Excellent service. Staffs are hospitable and professional. Food come in timely manner. I ordered the uni bibimbap and it was such a beautifully plated and colorful dish. the amount of uni is not as much as I would like it to be but oh well we all know how expensive uni is and for the price I think it's reasonable. Aside from visual, it tastes good and refreshing. There was a lot of healthy component in the dish, which was another plus point because my friend surprised with me dessert afterwards. It was breadpudding topped with ice cream and strawberry. The bread was soaked and soft, the spices were sweetly fragrant, the ice cream add extra boost both in flavor and texture plus a nice contrast of temperature and strawbs gave the sour kick to finish off the dish. it was delicous!"
5076,"Food 5/5 - The food was a little pricey but everything we ordered was pretty good. We liked the pork belly and fisherman's soup ramen a lot. Soy garlic wings were also pretty tasty. Service 3/5 - food took a while to come, and I'm 99% sure they forgot one of our dishes. We had literally finished everything else and our fisherman soup ramen didn't come, so we asked about it again, and it came way later. Not much service overall. ALSO, I wanted to make a reservation specifically for outdoor dining, but their website doesnt let you pick between indoor vs outdoor. I called around noon the day before to ask if I could specific request a reservation for outdoor dining. The guy who picked up said ok and asked me to hold for a moment. I then waited for 8 !!! minutes!!!! and then they hung up on me!!! They had just opened for lunch so I don't think they could have been that busy? But if they can't take the request they should have just told me, rather than put me on hold for so long and then forget about me and hang up on me..."
5077,Back here for the first time in awhile ( pre-covid) food was spot on.  Shared the Paella and it was more than sufficient. Service and drinks were very good too. I'll be back for sure. It's a can't miss if your in the Union Square area.
5078,"Really happy that I stopped by for lunch here. I was craving Korean food for a really long time so j came by for lunch and got the duck steamed buns, kimchi fried rice and chicken bibimbap. Let me tell you - the duck steamed buns were SOOOO good. It has coleslaw and pickle in it, which gave the buns so much flavor but didn't over power the duck and the buns were so soft and fluffy. The kimchi fried rice was really good and flavorful. I was actually surprised that there was cheese in the fried rice because I've actually never had kimchi fried rice with cheese in it before and I'm surprised more people don't add cheese on it more often! The bibimbap was good, wasn't anything special but it as tasty so I can't complain. It was actually really good portions of food too and I took some home for later and it was just as good too. I ended up buying a tuna burrito from the lunch menu to bring home to my fiancé and he said that it was delicious! My only caveat was the service. I went on a weekday around 2 PM and the restaurant wasn't nearly full and it took several minutes to get a waiter's attention. They also forgot about my order for home and took around an extra half an hour to get it for me. It did make me upset but I won't knock a star off for that since the food is actually really good and I'd like to go back to have their BBQ!"
5079,"Great food, great cocktails. Unfortunately, when I stopped in yesterday for a quick, late lunch, I witnessed the bartender be  unnecessarily rude to one of the servers. It was really tacky, inappropriate in front of customers and screamed of entitlement and racism. The bartender should be canned. Otherwise, wonderful meal. I won't go back, however. Not if that behavior is tolerated."
5080,"{covid} outdoor dining, was a hot day out. Been here a few times; overall i really do like the menu and food is quite good and i particularly appreciate how the flavors are not overexaggerated like most korean places. I find the prices on the more expensive side, however, which is why i don't frequent it often and only go whenever someone in my party wants to (hence the three stars)We got:- oysters ($1.5) 8/10: i think normally it's a happy hour deal but it seemed like it was all day for the time being- (cocktail) charlie collins ($12) 10/10: soju cocktail, v yummy exactly the kind of flavor profile i enjoy -- light and fruity w slight citrus- yukgaejang ramen ($24) 8/10: yummmmy but came out not piping hot. If i was to order again i'd ask for it to be extra spicy bc there was virtually no spice. - bibimbap ($22) 8/10: also v delicious, the rice gets very crispy and i enjoyed it slightly more than the yukgaejang but the bulgogi was not very good -- wasn't very bulgogi-like nor was the meat very tender."
5081,"Made a reservation with a friend for a Friday night and had to wait about 10 minutes before a table was available. Not a huge deal. This place has a ton of outdoor seating (appropriately distanced). The servers were incredibly attentive, constantly refilling our water glasses when they were just half full.I ordered the spicy pork steamed buns, and they were just okay. I've had some amazing bao, and these really fell short for me. The dough was soft but flavorless. There were pickles, but they tasted like jarred, rather than homemade, pickles. Now, I like pickles, but it was a little off-putting to crunch into some steamed bao with Vlassic inside. The spicy pork was good but unmemorable. The amount of food for $20 is not such a great value. I think this dish should be about $15 (especially when you consider that it's supposed to be an appetizer).My friend got the bulgogi burrito and said that the bulgogi just tasted like steak and wasn't that well seasoned. It was a decent amount of food, however, especially since it came with a small basket of fries. Probably worth the $20 in NYC, in terms of amount of food. Overall, it would have been more palatable at $16/$17.I probably won't be back here, since there are so many restaurant options in NYC. It wasn't the worst meal I've had. It just didn't stand out very much. The best part about this place is the service. They thanked us for supporting them and gave us each a free shot of whiskey! Now that's service."
5082,More like 3 and half stars. Came for lunch ago it seemed a bit quiet. I got the soy garlic chicken wings which was delicious. It was crispy and full of flavor. The little daikon pieces is refreshing. So I always get the uni bibimbap which used to come is a bowl but now it's in a tiny tin square box can. Hmmm... it still tasted good but the portion is smaller. Not sure it's worth $26.
5083,"Had the pork belly set, uni bibimbap, and truffle gnocchiPersonally the Uni Bibimbap was mediocre because the Uni had a weird salty ocean flavor that wasn't enjoyable. In addition its cold which isnt appetizing.The pork belly set was great but nothing to write home aboutI think the truffle Gnocchi was probsbly the best thing we had"
5084,"Second time back and my opinion still stand. If this is the only place open around and if you must go, do yourself a favor and order the tiger roll. Hands down the best thing on the menu, we ordered a second! (although I've only tried like 5 things..) oh and some truffle fries.Soy chicken is solid, with a beer in.Bulgogi tacos were dried and lacked in favors.To the owner:Please take the Uni Bimbap Paella off the menu. I appreciate the 'trying' creativity and you got me! But please, take it off. Thank you.Ambience is nice with friendly servers though (:"
5085,Delicious! Amazing spot to go try fusion style Korean food. Everything was fresh and so good. The ambiance was really nice - they gave us a closed area in the back of the restaurant. Good COVID measures taken and the staff were super friendly and helpful. Would definitely come here again whenever I can!
5086,"Over the top decorations , okay service. Food only tastes good if you're really hungry, otherwise its sub par. Come in if you want to eat Korean fusion food thats caked with cheese and ""truffle"" powder while watching Spanish telemundo news channel.If not, taking the 6 train or N train uptown from Union sq to 34 st to get to K-town is a better option."
5087,"We came to this place because of reviews and location and dine in ability, however we regretted this choice even before the food came. The kitchen was backed up and even though we ordered before our neighbors our food came after all the people that came after us. We waited for food 50+ min after we ordered. I wish we knew the wait time beforehand so we could have made an informed decision. The tea we ordered was pretty good. I recommend you go somewhere else if you want to eat in an hour.The waiter did come by and apologized said that they didn't expect it, but if they are so busy why did other people get their food!?"
5088,"I love their Jap Chae - the flavor is sublime - and their Tiger Roll - it's a party in a roll! The folks who work here are always great, and the room is gorgeous. Thank you, Barn Joo!"
5089,They have great staff and it's a really good experience for you and your family and kids because you can cook your own meals and get some form the kitchen and food is excellent-Mhari Feeney age 10 HOPE YOU COME
5090,"Came here during the holiday break to grab lunch.  Fortunately I had ordered via the app so by the timeI got there, my food was ready for pick up otherwise I would have had to line up for ages. There was a staff at the front door greeting people and handing out menus as they lined up. She was nice enough to walk in and grab my pick up as I had a stroller on me. I ordered the standard burger, fries and nuggets. Can't go wrong really other than having to find a spot to eat it at as the place was way too packed. My tip is to order ahead via the app if you are heading in during lunch period."
5091,"Halfway through our AMNH visit we were absolutely starving and ready for some quick, greasy food. We popped out and hit up Shake Shack around the corner. This place was SLAMMED. Like ZERO seating slammed. The line was super long, but it moved at a decent pace. After I placed my order I waited about 10 minutes for our Togo order. We ended up eating on a bench outside of the restaurant. We got the usual... burgers, fries, and hotdogs. Everything was soooo good. Definitely a good spot for a quick bite!"
5092,"Our Yelp Crew consisted of Robert C. and his wife Janeen when we headed north on Columbus Avenue today with me as guide. Naturally it was close to my eating time so I started to suggest places. Robert had a list. It's easier to spot something and obtain a consensus for lunch. I took the lead. I spotted the Shake Shack and saw people eating their hamburgers in the window. They looked so juicy so I stopped and turned to Robert with this as a suggestion. I was surprised to see a smile on his face. Janeen immediately said he wanted to try Shake Shake but it's far from their home. That got me excited. I like to see people get things off their bucket list! I got excited and I'm not much of a burger lover!They open early so it was perfect timing. The employees were smiling and friendly. I felt welcome. Robert asked one nice young lady employee to take a group photo of us. She gladly humored us and even took two. Janeen had Smoke Shack, Robert had Shack Burger and I had a burger with lettuce and cheese. I'm still full. It's a good burger. The bun is soft and fresh. I'm not a huge fan of meat but today this satisfied me. Robert will review their feelings about the food. They weren't as hungry as I was!! If you come to NYC go to Shake Shack and get a burger, fries, and a shake. It's a New York Company. Eat it in the city that made it famous."
5093,"East meets West.  Wife and I from Silicon Valley, CA met Yelper Marianne W of New York for the 4th time since May 2017, and came here for lunch.  Surprised that they were even open for lunch at 10:45am on a Tuesday.There are only two shake shacks in the entire 9 million people San Francisco Bay Area, and here in NYC there are at least 50 listed in Yelp.  So when we walked by this place, just had to come inside to try their burgers.Wife ordered the $7.39 smoke shack, me a $5.29 burger, and Marianne the $5.89 cheeseburger.Service is leisurely.  I pick up the food when the beeper rings, so no tipping required.The shackburger is a cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato and shacksauce.  Only Marianne defers on the tomato.  Next time I will volunteer to eat her tomato.The smokeshack is a cheeseburger with bacon, cherry pepper and shacksauce.  Wife didn't finish hers, so I ate it, minus the cheese and hot cherry peppers.  Sauce never did arrive.  The bacon costs $1.79 as a side addition, but comes standard on the smokeshack.  My hamburger comes with lettuce, tomato, pickle and onion.  No cheese on my burgers.  The bun is fresh and soft, but a bit on the small side between a slider and a full size hamburger.  Lots of slices of raw onions just the way I like them, rivaling the ""In and Out"" hamburgers both in onions and shake shack sauce, which tastes like the special sauce of ""In and Out"".  Decent amount of beef patty, but pricey at $5.29, double the price of an ""In and Out"" burger.  But, hey, it's New York, and there are no ""In and Outs"" east of Texas.No drinks except for tap water, and no fries.  We get out of there with three burgers for $20.22.  As we are leaving, I meet up with a lady staffer Sarah, who not only doesn't mind having her picture taken, but smiles in the picture.  Would we come here again?  We walk Marianne home, and along the way she points out ""Good Enough To Eat"" and Gabriela's restaurants.  Next  April or October when we come back to New York, we can meet her there, perhaps with some women's size 7 Hoka One One's for a lady who walks 1500 miles a year.  SOS for my wife's burger means sauce on the side.  It can also literally mean SOS if you eat those cherry peppers too quickly!"
5094,"My first shake shack experience did not disappoint! I got the cheeseburger, fries and a shake."
5095,"Love this place. The milkshakes are thick and creamy. Fries perfectly seasoned and crisp. Burger hits the spot without feeling overwhelming. You can taste the quality, which I appreciate."
5096,Great staff & location that is near the museum. Maybe mgt. should rethink the water available to customers. Putting a used bottle directly on something used by everyone was a bad idea before COVID.
5097,Came for the truffle burger special. Super good even though I was skeptical of it just being a truffle sauce. Exceeded expectations.
5098,"I deserve this,you deserve this! A man's burger or a woman's burger! It's a Burger Double from Shake Shack. I ate the fries and Chicken Bites first. I wanted to enjoy them while they were hot. Shake Shack a great place to indulge in your guilty pleasures!"
5099,"I hate leaving a bad review, especially during this time when I know restaurants are struggling, but... I was so excited to try the new limited-time Korean FRIED chicken sandwich tonight, which sounded delicious. I don't think I could be more disappointed. The only crunchy element on this sandwich was the slaw. The sandwich was basically the equivalent of boiled chicken with sauce. The sauce was good, but this was not what I was expecting nor what is advertised. I've eaten at this shake shack for years and honestly if I had done Yelp reviews from every order each would probably range anywhere from 2-5 because the customer experience and food varies that much, sadly. This time was so different and disappointing that I had to leave a review. This is a special for Korean-style FRIED chicken sandwich. It's a special. It's limited. It's supposed to be FRIED (aka. Crispy). How do you get that so wrong? Even the fries were ice cold despite the delivery taking less than 10 mins to get delivered. I don't expect steaming hot fries for delivery in January (even with an insulated delivery bag), but they were inedible. And you know there is no reheating fries... The only redeeming quality is that the burger was done to order and delicious. Glad I had a backup burger because the chicken sandwich and fries got tossed in the garbage."
5100,"The best breakfast we had in New York, went back two more times. You can't beat it. The signature sandwiches are fantastic, didn't have any I didn't enjoy! Only recommendation is better beverage pricing, I hit up a deli or 7/11 between coming here instead."
5101,"Another GREAT experience! This time we brought the kids. Our son has a physical disability and uses a chair to get around. Johnny was quick to find a spot for us to put his chair while we ate. The food was great, as usual! We will always stop here when in the city. The Hines Fam"
5102,"Loved this place on so many levels!The food is amazing, of course. That's what you really go for. It's a tiny luncheonette which consists of a counter for about 10 people, and two tables in the back that seat 4 and 2. The service is so personal, you feel like you walked into your grandmother's kitchen (my apologies to all grandfathers). Everything is made to order, mostly on the grill right at the front of the shop. The workers execute what looks like a beautifully choreographed dance as they efficiently make and serve every order (they also do a huge take-out business). The ambiance is wonderful, the service is warm and friendly, but you go for the food. I had the king kong french toast even though I knew I could only eat a third. Still, it was worth it. My partner had the farmer's omelette which was also delicious. I saw great looking pancakes. They don't try to trick you into thinking their juice is freshly squeezed, it's listed as Tropicana. Their coffee is good and comes with the breakfast plates. As I left, I told them that if I lived in NYC, I would come work there. I was told that I was hired for $1/hr, no lunch. I said I'd take it. Hey, it's family!"
5103,"While heading out for breakfast, my husband and I found that our initial breakfast choice was closed so we turned around and came across Johny's. What a blessing in disguise! While it's a cozy little spot with limited seating, we were able to snag two stools before a line formed outside, and we quickly found out why. The food was traditional diner food and oh so yummy! I had the French toast with bacon and my husband had the salami and egg on a roll. The food is made to order, the coffee is hot and the service/owner was wonderful and extremely friendly and accommodating. This is a place we would definitely visit again before leaving this beautiful city! Check it out if you're in the area....you won't be disappointed."
5104,I  ordered the Mexican eggs for take out and they might be my new favorite breakfast dish. I'll definitely be one of their more frequent customers from here on out.
5105,"A small welcoming hole in the wall, but boy am I glad we caught it! Such kind staff and friendly cooks! Delicious food and extremely affordable, will walk in WHENEVER i pass by empty tummy or not lol"
5106,"Cute NYC diner spot. Think a less frenzied Waffle House, but definitely a well oiled machine. Loved that they check all identification and vaccination cards.Each meal comes with coffee which I don't drink , but my husband had mine because they do charge for refills which is also fine. Breakfast potatoes were good, but I should have asked for crispy. Bacon was terribly flabby, but I definitely believe it was because I didn't give any information on what I wanted so that was my problem, not the cooks.Eggs were perfect because I did make specific requests there. So keep that in mind. It's a tiny spot and the gentlemen running it are on point. They do a booming take out business. It was fun to watch them do their thing. Just be specific in how you want things cooked. Best prices for breakfast in the entire city!!"
5107,"Friendly cooks, delicious food, and free coffee if you order a breakfast sandwich. What more do you want? Had the fried salami breakfast sandwich w/ onions, bell peppers, and some coffee. Girlfriend had banana pancakes. Definitely recommend both."
5108,This place is amazing! We come here for breakfast all the time. Sometimes there is a wait but it's ok! I'm willing to wait for good food. The people who work here are very nice too! Always making people smile. This restaurant is truly a gem worth visiting several times!
5109,The classic Breakfast place. Fast friendly hot food at a reasonable price . We really loved watching the food made in front of us on a grill.
5110,"Delicious pancakes! This is such a cozy NY gem. It's very tiny so be prepared to wait. I assume the person working is Johny, he's a one man show, takes the orders, cooks and mans the register. It's great just watching him handle everything with such ease and pleasantry. My friend had the pancakes, I had a few bites.... mmmhmmm just as delicious as people have stated. I decided to go with the Farmers omelette it has onions, mushrooms and tomatoes and comes with potatoes and toast. I will definitely be stopping by in the future to try the lunch menu. Also to add, he's got the ""good"" bacon, ya know the one that's crunchy, crispy and tender all at the same time! Enjoy!"
5111,"Great, Freshly made diner style food packed in a small location!    Searching for a breakfast location I found this place and went in specifically for the King Kong. It's a little bit of everything you love for breakfast. It's a little sweet, and savory.  The King Kong is ""French Toast on a hero with 3 eggs, Bacon, Bananas, and Cinnamon"" It is absolutely delicious!!! I also ordered a side if home fries, which were good and well seasoned.  Service was impeccable!  The entire staff was friendly!For such a small space, They run like a well oiled machine. You can tell customer service is first priority. To-go orders are processed through the outside window, which eliminates excess people from waiting inside. You can order via phone, in-person, or online for simple easy pickup. We chose to dine in. There was someone in front of us and We had to wait outside, but the guy was pretty accurate with the timing. Seating is somewhat limited, but I enjoy my breakfasts hot and fresh, so we chose to wait.!I know it's a luncheonette (Hopefully diner isn't offensive), but I wish larger diners would take-notes from Johny's, because This is how you do it well! A good staff and good food!!!"
5112,What a fantastic spot for breakfast! We were in the city for the day and stopped here first. A couple of breakfast sandwiches made fresh. It was a very cold day but these hit the spot and kept us warm while we walked downtown. Highly recommend eating in or picking up from Johnny's!
5113,"You might have read in other reviews or blog posts or articles that claim a fancy, expensive restaurant has the ""best pancakes in NYC."" I regret to inform you that they are mistaken, because that glorious designation can only go to Johny's.I have been coming here since I happened upon Johny's for my first birthday breakfast in NYC 5 years ago. The absolute best way to experience Johny's is to get a seat at the counter, not a table, so you can watch the cooking process. Come alone, come with friends- Johny's is perfect for either.The pancakes are perfect, the eggs are always made exactly to order, and the bacon is the perfect amount of crisp. Want cream with your coffee? They'll hand you the entire carton. Although I have never strayed from the reliable pancakes, my friends assure me their breakfast sandwiches and grilled cheese are equally delicious.My one complaint is I live too far for delivery, and they don't have outdoor seating right now! But that is okay- Johny's is worth the trip and I will freeze my butt off at nearby Madison Square Park if it means I get a bite of their banana chocolate chip pancakes."
5114,"We stopped in here for breakfast after arriving in NYC.  It was a VERY small little restaurant, but good things come in small packages.  The food was inexpensive, quick, and hit the spot!  I had the breakfast burrito & my husband had the French toast.  Glad we stopped in!"
5115,"Thanks for reaching out. It's the menu on here. When you scroll from the top down there is no distinction between where breakfast ends and lunch begins. Right under the bagels are burgers so it looks like you have those at breakfast. Btw, we had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed our visit, even without a burger :)"
5116,"Love this place!  Great food, delicious mocha!  Good company (owner & staff are friendly, cheerful).  Can order takeout at outside window, a few people can socially distance inside at the counter & couple of tables.  Such a great energy to this place!  (Good for your health!). They are careful to keep customers safe.  Good people, who care about the food they make gor their customers.  A lot of repeat customers:  a clear sign they're doing it right!LOVE THIS PLACE!"
5117,"I had such high hopes for this place because of the incredible Yelp reviews, but it was a complete disaster. I ordered two omelets for brunch for pickup. We got there on time for our pickup time and we had to wait an additional 20 minutes. Not only was this inconvenient, but the staff was incredibly rude and unapologetic. It was a 'cheap eat' so we let it go. I started to eat the omelet and noticed it was completely inedible. My partner ordered the ham omelet and everything was undercooked. After a few bites, I noticed TWO HAIRS in my potatoes. To say I was absolutely disgusted was an understatement. I immediately called the restaurant because clearly there are food violations here and don't want anyone else to get sick. They politely said they would refund the order which I appreciated. Almost a week later and they have yet to refund the order. Not only was this a traumatic, disgusting situation but they didn't keep their word. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
5118,Probably one of my absolute favorite places! Johnny himself was wonderful! Food was amazing! I wish I was able to go here more but my husband ended up in the hospital instead so we had to move hotels. Hopefully I can get back there. I had a huge breakfast and it was so good!
5119,"the luncheonette / diner scene has been fading from the memories and mouths of New Yorkers for the last two decades. thankfully, Johny's Luncheonette is keeping the experience alive and filling hungry stomachs accordingly with delicious calories since 1995. the space is superclean, brightly lit, and possesses a simple welcoming vibe and decor. most seats are at the counter bar with a few tables in the back. Johny's does takeout as well as delivery via food apps, too. it is a small space, so there might be a wait during busier eating hours--open from 8 am to 3:30 pm. i was here around 11ish on a weekday...no wait at all. order at the counter, your eats are made practically in front of you, eat away, and pay at the counter. recently got a bacon, eggs, and cheese sandwich (2 eggs--protein bruh)--it comes with one cup of coffee. the bacon was plentiful and cooked to crispness with some give, which is really how all bacon should be cooked, the eggs were fully cooked through, but nice and soft (not rubbery), the cheese was melty, and the roll was pillowy and tasted fresh (not old). the breakfast sandwich was satisfying, had all those savory elements, and was the comfort food that i needed as a late breakfast. normally i ask for the roll to be toasted and salt and pepper, perhaps next time i will...but the breakfast sandwich was everything you want--protein, dairy, and fat, wrapped in carbs. the coffee was a solid cup of hot caffeine--nothing special but nothing lacking either. the menu is a mix of other breakfast sandwiches and platters, lots of lunch items from the grill, cold food options as well and more. the menu does have a lot of variety without being too overwhelming. simple ingredients transformed into simply tasty options. my bacon, egg, and cheese sando with coffee was $5.25 + tax + tip.the service is friendly and chatty. it's a good vibe and provides a much needed element that's been lost in dining rooms nowadays. so after i paid, i realized i was charged wrong for my meal. mistakes happen (got charged $6,25 + tax + tip) and i ended up paying a little more for my meal because i paid in cash not by card and i guess the dude who settled my check misread a ""5"" for a ""6."" no biggie, as a little extra going to a local business is not a bad thing, but it is a reminder that they do have a $10 minimum on credit/debit...hence why i still carry cash.drops mic cuz i'm back to the grill againi outzzz"
5120,"Delicious food! We got the breakfast burrito (yummy but has a lot of hot sauce, so be ware if you don't have a high spicy tolerance), and the basic egg/potatoes/toast. we went twice and the first time the line was at-least an hour wait. If your hotel is nearby ID recommend ordering online, and taking it back to your hotel. Don't miss out on this gem!!!!"
5121,"I was not expecting much from this place, found it on Yelp as it was close by my hotel and decided to check out. The place itself is small, the owner sat us in the middle and social distanced us leaving two empty seats next to my friend and I. As we ordered, I got to watch him prepare the food, an order of chocolate chip pancakes and some eggs. Wow those eggs were so good and I've had a craving for chocolate chip pancakes ever since. It was so delicious!!!! He got our food out right away too, not too long of a wait. He was running the place alone, taking orders, cooking and closing out the checks.He was so nice too and I felt like it was so typical New York (accent and all). I felt like I was in a movie scene lol.Seriously been thinking about this place and how good it was. Too bad I live thousand of miles away, I'd be a regular. I for sure will visit sometime soon and come back! Check it out if you're the area, you won't be disappointed."
5122,"Worth the wait. Nice breakfast before venturing out with family to look around NYC. Josh was really nice, order was done well and exactly to one's liking. Coffee was perfect"
5123,"Quick service. Great prices. Tasty food. I live nearby so I'll be coming here frequently. Very extensive menu, so the only problem is choosing what to get. Great experience"
5124,"We were in the city visiting  from Houston, TC. Restaurant is small but has a home feel to it. Staff is really great and attentive. My gf and I felt very welcomed and taken care of and the food was delicious!"
5125,"This is a tiny, traditional, counter (like 10 seats) only restaurant. We were hungry and wanted the basic American breakfast. It's not the place for fancy eats -- this is standard lunch counter fare. But it's good quality, reasonably priced, and fast. Our cook/server was cheerful and helpful. Although -- he is not the mysterious ""Johnny,"" who we were told is the owner.I din't have the mushroom omelette -- but I pose a question to other Yelpers...is the menu description accurate?"
5126,Got the egg white vegetable wrap. No spinach added when the menu mentioned it. Not worth the $7 (with seamless taxes). I didn't contact the restaurant about the issue though. Didn't have the time to go back to the restaurant. But they should get their order/ingredients right the first time. Especially when it was not busy at all during the time I picked up the order. Will give the restaurant another try though since it has many good reviews.
5127,"Super delicious food and helpful staff. They are good at what they do. Keep in mind this is a bar-type seating arangement, not a room of tables . Total of probably 15 customers maximum inside at a time. Gotta wait in line for your seat if the place is busy. We had to wait outside maybe 30 min before being allowed in and seated (sunday morning 9:30) , but the food is made quickly. A fun and yummy experience. Plus a free cup of coffee with entres. Check it out for great pancakes and scrambled eggs"
5128,"Delicious breakfast sandwiches. It brought back memories, from when I used to leave in NY. A nice egg, bacon and cheese sandwich in a Kiser roll. Soooo good. Love it. As to the service Josh was excellent, great servers Fe. Thank you Josh."
5129,"Probably my favorite place to eat in NYC so far. I got some crazy concoction of french toast with bacon, bananas, and cinnamon. Including unlimited coffee, the total came out to be about $10.25. Honestly, they should be charging a little bit more.Johny's staff was very helpful and kept serving me coffee. My only complaint was that they were showing Fox News on TV. If I lived in NYC, I'd go here every other day."
5130,Great food and service.  Worth the short wait.  It was everything I read about online and more.
5131,"It's a small spot with less than 20 seats. The service was quick, and super intimate due to the small space. I got the breakfast platter and it was exactly what you need in the morning. Will definetly come back on our next trip to NYC."
5132,"This place is truly great. If I worked in the area I would come here more often but I only stumbled upon it on Yelp looking for breakfast one day. I grabbed a seat at the counter and ordered up a Western Omelette and OJ. The food certainly did not disappoint. The eggs were delicious, the potatoes were moist and the toast was perfectly buttered. I honestly couldn't have asked for anything more from such a simple meal.The guy behind the counter (unclear of his role) was very friendly and welcoming. In the short time that I was sitting there, he greeted at least 4 customers by name and it was visible that they are regulars. If I ever owned a restaurant this would be the epitome of what I would want. Great food, warm atmosphere and superb customer service. I highly recommend!"
5133,"I liked the friendly staff & atmosphere. However, the small omelette & coffee charged by the cup (or we were overcharged) was a disappointment. Also, the menu we saw online had breakfast bagel sandwiches- which my wife wanted, but they weren't on the menu or anywhere to be seen at the restaurant."
5134,"A small luncheonette counter but worth the wait.  Omelette , Pancakes and good coffee. Friendly staff not Too expensive. Have cash , credit card machine was down .   Next time I visit New York.  I will come back"
5135,"Love this place! Delicious food, friendly service, convenient location. My go to for breakfast every time I stay in the city. Try to get there a little after they open as it does get crowded."
5136,"Been wanting to try this place since ever! Unfortunately it's always packed, the seats are so limited, I was in a rush, or some people are just impatient, so I just can't make it happen. Until one day the long awaited day arrived.i love the ambience right when we walk in. no frill, hole in the wall, authentic diner vibe. me and my sister sit at the end of the counter and shared Big Man Breakfast and French Toast because we want both pancake & french toast. took awhile for the food to come out but the kitchen before us is always hustling & bustling as they prepare food for the packed restaurant and also takeouts order.  we didn't mind though because me & my sis get to talk and chill while wait for the food to come out.food came out in decent portion and smells amazing. comforting and scrumptious too. note: their pancake is the chewy type rather than airy.. french toast was good. crispy bacon. sausage and potatoes were perfectly cooked as welll. even the toast on the side has perfect texture. reasonably priced too!service was great! heads up to the guy who served us. don't know his name but he has tattoo on his left forearm and he was great! great experience!"
5137,Excellent service.. good was delivered quickly and the variety is immense which is great.  Good is freshly prepared and not one of 8 hot drinks was spilled.. will order again.
5138,"We stumbled across Johnny's on Yelp on our last day in NYC before flying home to Texas. We love eating what the locals recommend so we were super excited to give it a try. We showed up knowing seating is very limited but we were happy to see we were able to seat right away, of course after temp checks and what not. The little restaurant is so stinking cute, I love the nostalgia of it, and it's also super clean! There were so many items on the menus to choose from, definitely had great variety. I chose to go simple with blueberry banana pancakes and sausage links and, oh my goodness, they were amazing!! My friends chose the King Kong and they also loved their choice! Johnny, the owner, was very friendly. He and his staff are certainly hard workers and work great as a team. I 100% recommended this place to absolutely everyone! We are already planning our second trip to NYC in the fall and this will definitely be our go-to for breakfast. Thanks Johnny for such an awesome experience!"
5139,A diner breakfast spot where you're able to watch them cook which is cool. It was honestly just average food.
5140,Pancakes were amazing! The staff was super friendly and made sure you were taken care of.
5141,"AMAZING PLACE!! My boyfriend and I went 08/30 morning to get breakfast, and from the service to the food it was all awesome. I got the jersey shore and my bf got the lumberjack pancakes. 10/10! Recommend and looking forward to going back"
5142,Great little joint for hearty breakfast.  Coffee was good and service excellent.  Get the big man breakfast it will not disappoint.
5143,Family of 5 accommodated in this small place was an ease. Customer service was superb. Food was fast and delicious. Great place to have breakfast. Oh and must try the pancakes.
5144,Best breakfast in town. Johny is amazing and makes you feel welcome. My sister got her wisdom teeth removed before we visited and he let her build her own meal (of soft foods) with no hesitation. LOVE this place!
5145,"I would give it a 5 star because the food was AMAZING! However, the restaurant stated it closed at 3 arrived 2:06 we weren't allowed inside because they were ""about to close"" . The cook was a bit rude about it. Served one more person after me and then told everyone else they were closed already. Other than that, the food was fire! I ordered a breakfast burrito and a breakfast sandwich ."
5146,Delicious and affordable! So glad I stumbled upon this small spot during my last stay. Btw - it's so small and easy to walk past. Order ahead if it's the weekend or busier time of day. The line is long on Saturday mornings.
5147,"truly one of my favorite places! johny's is a small restaurant so we typically get it to go and eat at home because it is super close to our apartment. their breakfast is unrealllllll - the breakfast burrito is probably the best ive found in NY, and the pancakes are incredible and taste just like your mom made them on a nice sunday morning. today we got johny's for lunch for the first time and we were not disappointed! i got the cuban sandwich with fries. it was so delicious and big enough i was able to have half for lunch and the other half for dinner!"
5148,Total rip-off. A $5 (with tax) egg and bacon roll consisted of a single egg valiantly trying and failing to cover the roll.
5149,This place is amazing! You need to check it out if you're ever in New York. Delicious pancakes!
5150,Stopped by for their Saturday brunch. I tried - - huevas rancheros : this was so flavorful and egg was cooked perfectly The guacamole was rich and creamy. My friend also liked heir cauliflower tacos. Drinks were strong here and the music was great!! Can't wait to be back to do their bottomless brunch.
5151,"Vida Verde is a super fun, trendy and lively restaurant! I went here with my boyfriend on a Saturday for lunch around 2:30pm and we didn't have to wait, we were seated right away. The music is so fun and makes you want to dance out of your seat, even in the middle of the day. Servers do wear masks, and theres glass between tables inside. Service overall was pretty fast, the got us waters right away and someone came promptly to check in on us. The food and drinks here are amazing! We got the nachos and it came with pinto bean puree (which tasted sooooo fresh, you could tell it wasn't canned or at least did not taste like it), picked jalapenos, pickled onions, pico de gallo and jalapeno cilantro crema (my FAVORITE part). I hope that description made you hungry because typing that did the job for me. Overall, the nachos were AMAZING, 10/10. They were $15 and it was the only thing we ordered to share since we weren't too hungry. But it is a pretty large portion! If we had ordered this as an app on a regular day, we definitely wouldn't have been able to eat much else. We also wouldn't have been able to resist eating the nachos and saving room for the entree, it was THAT good!For drinks, we also got one to share and it was the Juan punch wonder. It's a punch bowl that comes with a cute little rubber duck and flower petals in it. Honestly, its adorable! There's a hint of passion fruit, lemon and cinnamon which I loved. It was the perfect amount of sweet and easily sharable between two people. The punch bowl was $20, so at $10 a person this is really a steal. I would definitely come back on another day and try something new. I'm interested to see how this place would be for brunch or for dinner. It seems like it would be a fun time for a day out with friends or a date! I give it a 5/5."
5152,"Me and the wife were looking for a place to grab a quick drink before heading back to our hotel. We ended up giving Vida Verde a shot and it did not disappoint. Perhaps the reason was the vibes and the atmosphere was great. We wanted to check out their rooftop bar. I was under the impression it would be much higher so you can have a view of the city but it wasn't. So we decided to go back downstairs to the second floor and it was probably for the best.We found a couple seats at the bar and it turned out to be a great night . Our bartender , I believe his name was Abraham. He was great! Great vibe and energy. We started off with two drinks and the party started. Abraham took care of us. The drinks were great! Shoutout to him and the waiter, I didn't catch his name. Super friendly guys. Kudos to y'all. It was what we were looking for. That great New York hospitality."
5153,This review is only for takeout!!!!I got the shrimp quesadilla and the shrimp was flavorful. The delivery was fast but the presentation was not good. Kind of sloppy and you'll see in the pictures. The avocado salsa was incredible! Only problem was it was barely half full (the container). I just thought the quesadilla was all cheese and not much shrimp. It was pretty greasy too even though it was delivered quick. I ordered to my hotel because I was tired from the travel into the city and needed to eat late. The micro greens were more like a tiny chopped salad and good. I've heard really amazing things about this place and Im sure the presentation is much better in person. I wouldn't order takeout from here again but would definitely give it a shot in person. The flavors were on point :)
5154,"This is a fun place to go with friends! I liked the ambience and it's a great place to grab drinks. My friends and I ordered food only, and I got a birria quesadilla, which was so tasty. It came with a spicy sauce on the side which went well with the quesadilla. The price point is pretty reasonable for what you get and I would recommend this as a good Latin restaurant!"
5155,"Heard about this place from instagram, decided to go for brunch and wow I'm impressed.The menu is amazing The DJ is incredible The service was excellent"
5156,Came here on a Saturday night and had a lot of fun.  The music was great and there was space to dance.  No cover either.  Margaritas were also tasty.
5157,"First time and definitely not disappointed. Came here with my girlfriends for valentine and had a great time. The vibe, the music and the staff where amazing. The drinks where also good, definitely recommend the punch bowl and the watermelon margarita for food the brisket empanadas were amazing"
5158,"Great place to celebrate special events such  as a promotion, anniversary, engagement or birthday. Fun drinks and environment"
5159,"Saw this place on Tik Tok and had to try it out! Overall, I was a little disappointed on the vibe--we sat upstairs at a very small table with shaky stools and it was unpleasant. However, the food was very good!! The empanadas were so soft and delicious and the Birria quesadilla was out of this world! The only complaint about the food that we had was the Esquites. It was way too runny and too spicy and we didn't care for it. The taste of the food made up for the vibe and esquites so I definitely recommend!"
5160,We came for brunch on a Sunday. The place is beautiful! I love the colorful vibes and look to the place. The music was also really awesome and that really made the place for us. The food was pretty good! I enjoyed the crispy fish tacos a lot! The French toast was okay to me! We had bottomless mimosas and I kept drinking! Service was awesome and Nicole took care of us really well! She filled our cups even without us asking! I would definitely come back!
5161,"This was the perfect spot to kick off our NYC weekend. Everyone on here is absolutely correct in saying it is dark and loud - I definitely was yelling as soon as we left and headed out to the street following our amazing mealWe were promptly greeted by the hostess who took our ID and vaccination cards and checked in on our reservation. We were 10 mins early for it, but she seated us right away. This place was full when we sat for a 7pm reservation on a Thursday, so definitely book ahead on Resy. Anthony was a fantastic server - he knew the menu and was happy to give great suggestions. We went a bit overboard and ordered salsa, guac and queso fundido for our apps, but all were amazing. It was the best queso fundido my mom and I ever had, and we order any melted cheese appetizer we see, so that's saying something.I got the seasonal special frozen margarita (pomegranate hibiscus) and it was amazing and fresh and STRONG. I got two of them. My mom tried two drinks Anthony suggested and enjoyed both.For dinner my mom got a chicken quesadilla and I got Anthony's suggested steak tacos - both amazing! This chicken quesadilla actually had seasoning and flavor.. definitely worth trying. The steak tacos were full and had enough filling I had to use chips to finish it off!A manager came over to see how we were doing and take away empty glasses, something I always appreciate.Thanks to Anthony and the whole team for a fantastic experience! Definitely come here for a night in nyc - first date, this may be a bit loud, but anything else? This is the cool, delicious place to be!"
5162,"We found this place since initially we were looking for a roof top bar, we decided to stay downstairs since u can't get food upstairs.  Drinks to start we got a pitcher of the White Sangria , not bad Also tried the Blueberry coconut margarita good taste wise but not worth the $45 dollar price tag for the SMALL pitchers they give u way too overpriced.  On the food we tried a few items Wings , not bad delicious Yuca Fries not enough of the sauces for dipping, very good Shrimp empanadas , the Bistec tacos were decent as well & finally very good Chorizo nachos they were tasty great tasting meat good combo. after dinner we made our way upstairs to check out the roof top, wait .. what roof top? ahh it's a pretty small space with no view better off hanging downstairs. Nice looking place over all , fun decorations , good music playing .. service was good price wise for the drinks could be better aside from this we enjyed our time here."
5163,"Ordered the nachos, burrito and margarita. Let me start by saying that the vibe of this restaurant is very cool. Perfect hang out for a date or a afterwork thing. Perfect music and bar area is awesome to hang out. Nachos were great as well. Did not get any meat on it. Now the burrito depends on your taste. I am not big fan of too much seasoning. I could taste too much cumin on the meat. Maybe the chef was having an off night but I am willing to give this place a try again. Also downside idk if this is a thing but they only had one flavor of frozen margarita which is odd in a Mexican restaurant but the margarita was amazing top notch. Definitely will come back here. Also have deals during the week that sound amazing."
5164,Quick bite after Broadway. Food and drinks were great. Good vibes and music for friends.
5165,"I celebrated my birthday at Vida Verde with a big group and we all opted in for bottomless brunch. I loved the decor and wall murals. The food was okay (needed to put hot sauce in my meal) but the portions were huge! I ordered the chilaquiles and Only ate half of it. Since we were a huge group and almost all of us were drinking mimosas, I was expecting the waiter to provide mimosa pitchers but the restaurant has a policy where the waiters can only serve a glass at a time. It was a little hectic trying to find the waiter every time we needed a refill. The music was okay too, the DJ was playing a lot of old school pop/rock that wasn't fitting our brunch vibes but overall we all had a good experience."
5166,This place is gorgeous! Walking in I felt transported to the streets of Mexico during a colorful festival. My friend and I were seated right away and staff was very welcoming. There are temperature checks taken before you are seated.I ordered the shrimp quesadillas and a sangria. The sangria was amazing! It was just the right amount of fruity and sweet. I was very pleased. The shrimp quesadillas were very good as well. We also shared a plate of chips and guac which was very fresh and delicious. I like this place a lot and definitely would return to try some other things on the menu. My only complaint was that the place was very chilly and I didn't feel much heat on.
5167,I went to Vida Verda for a friends birthday brunch. We have a party of 20 but drinks were never empty. Our server was Anthony and he was absolutely awesome! We ordered guac for the table and it was DELICIOUS. I had the chorizo & eggs sliders and I'm still thinking of it. Highly recommend & seriously Anthony you were great and made the experience so fun!
5168,"Fantastic spot for happy hour! Came here on a Tuesday with a few friends and had a great time. There's a rooftop section available and the server we had was very friendly. For drinks, I had their hibiscus and passionfruit frozen margaritas were delicious. Since we also happened to visit on Taco Tuesday I got the Pollo Adobado tacos, which were fantastic. Will definitely be back for another happy hour!"
5169,"I would say this is a really good place for the group. The beverages are overflowing and the music is so good. The food was fine but it wasn't the best tacos/guacamole I've had. I personally had the tacos and did not love it, but I tried the brunch sliders and they were so much better. If you're coming for a boozy brunch, this is definitely a good visit but if you're coming for amazing food, I'd probably go somewhere else"
5170,"Overall vibes are nice. Went there for the team drink. Because expecting to precipitate, the rooftop was not open, it is first come first serve basis, no reservation is taken, and 90'mins per table. We were required to move to the bar after the 90 mins.The drinks are nice. Chips are good as well. Both the margarita and sangria are tasty. The pitcher is much smaller than I thought. If you are served the cup for water, it is like 4 servings with the ice."
5171,"Vida Verde is a good spot to go if you're looking for drinks and apps with an almost club-like vibe. While I think it's on the loud side for what it is, Vida Verde has a cool, laidback atmosphere with casual but solid service.That said, nothing about it is particularly exceptional (the food, the drinks, decor, etc). I probably would only go back again for very particular circumstances."
5172,"Located in midtown west, this Mexican spot brings a packed crowd with great music. Customer service was great when I made a reservation however, the service provided at the restaurant was below mediocre. It was a Thursday night, right before Xmas eve so the spot began to fill up quickly. Although the music is a bit loud and can't hear each other without shouting, we were feeling the music. However, we were disappointed by the service provided by our waiter Ralph. We waited a while until my friend had to get his attention to take our order and his reason for the  delay was ""I saw you guys talking so didn't want to bother"" which was a lie bc two couples next to us were also conversing, but he took their orders quickly.  Also, one of the food server was rude when I asked him to bring hot sauce. He simply stated ""wait for your server and you can tell him!"" Now for the food, the esquites and steak tacos were good but the fish tacos had a very strong, fishy smell that was unbearable. So, I decided to douse it with lots of hot sauce. Overall, it's a nice spot to have some drinks and enjoy the music but I'm not too sure about the food. I hope their service improves with time and they receive proper training  on how to serve customers! Maybe it's a different vibe in the Summer (I hope!)."
5173,"Great drink, my fave Blueberry Coconut margarita made by bartender Abraham. Will come in my next visit!!!"
5174,"I came to Vida Verde on a Saturday night with a group of 6 people. We made a reservation a few days in advance and the staff was very understanding about accommodating a larger group (we changed the party size a few times.) We arrived on time and had our IDs and COVID vaccine cards checked, then we were promptly seated in a long high rise table with stools. The ambiance was very lively, with good music, nice lighting reminiscent of a club and even a large disco ball! We ordered a bowl of tortilla chips with salsa while we waited for our drinks and nachos. The tortilla chips were warm and perfectly salted, and the salsa was also very fresh and not too spicy. For our drinks we got a margarita pitcher as well as a red wine sangria pitcher. The drinks were okay. I think the size of the pitcher was a bit small for the price and the alcohol content seemed a little weak. The nachos on the other hand were actually fantastic: oh my god ! These were loaded with delicious melted cheese, refried beans, crema, Pico de Gallo, pickled onions and small pieces of jalapeño. I never seek out nachos but these gave me a pretty good insight as to why people are really into them! Even though it seems like that might be too much to put over tortilla chips the flavors were perfectly balanced and it was a pretty filling and satisfying snack split between a group of 6. I'm another note, the music can be a bit loud so, if you are looking for a quiet date spot, this might not be the place to be but it's certainly a good place to come with friends on a weekend night! Overall I had a good experience here. Would not come back for the drinks but would come back in the future for nachos and the disco ball."
5175,"The food was good and our waiter was very nice. It was very loud and not a lot of space to move around. The Punch Bowl Drink in the picture is supposed to be for 2, but really only for 1 person. We also had the Yuca Fries & Guacamole which were good."
5176,This spot first and foremost is beautiful inside the ambiance is very soothing if you go on a Tuesday it's taco Tuesday the cauliflower tacos are delicious I tried a fish one which is cool but for a healthier eating go with the veggie and there yucca fries omg  the punch bowl was good with a splash of sprite on the side the mule over Mexico amazing I mean this place did it for me I will definitely be returning can't wait to experience the rooftop this place is really nice
5177,"First time been in here, searched by Yelp. We didn't have reservations, but the host still seat as promptly. The atmosphere here is very fun, all the lights and good music. We just ordered few things simple, my husband got the chicken taco and I had the crispy fish taco, both are delicious, slightly spicy in a very good way. The chips and salsa was really good too, the chips taste fresh and crispy, love the salsa mix too. Overall, a good find, will definitely come again when we are in the neighborhood. I think it is a great after work drink/get together place too."
5178,The brisket tacos and guacamole were SO good. Haven't had anything here I didn't like. Definitely a favorite spot I order from regularly. No additional notes - just get it. ;)
5179,"Ambiance inside  I didn't get to see outside.  Music  Food  Drinks .   I thoroughly enjoyed all the food.   The Yuca fries were thee best version of fries I've ever had.  Hands down.  The fries come with 4 sauces.  2 are great, (orange, purple) the dark orange one is terrible and the other was ok.   Their fries are stacked so cute as well.  I can drink,  but my drink was so strong I had to send it back.... I'm not complaining.  I'm just saying, be prepared.  The music was cute and upbeat, loud enough to enjoy but not so loud I couldn't carry on a conversation.   Due to how the walls and tables are set up the restaurant feels cozy, especially with the dim lighting."
5180,"Really great vibes and service! Chips/salsa - really good, I love warm chips and salsa. The bestChicken enchiladas - delicious! No complaints, coming from a Texan Tamarind margaritas - this was ok, not much flavor Sangria - it was pretty good! I'd come back :)"
5181,"Absolutely love Vida Verde! Pre-Covid for sure, but even during this adjusted and limited capacity of indoor dining!  The food tastes fresh, is delicious and can be reasonably customized.  Service is always very friendly and prompt. Our food came out shortly after our drinks and appetizers. Our host, Archie, was a good sport with our medium sized group.  They offer a nice assortment of tequila, some mezcal and a full bar.The place is immaculately maintained, has great ambiance and is festively decorated with good music.  A very nice place to meet up with friends and take pictures (this place is very social media friendly).  This place would also be fun for a date.  Pre-COVID there was access to their rooftop which is a nice social spot. Currently:1) Temp scans, masks required, contact info collected, social distancing enforced, and limited capacity are enforced. 2) 90 minutes time limit for each table3) As Pre-COVID, they will only seat complete parties4) They offer mezcal!5) Seating at the bar is closed off but is very nice if we ever get to experience that again."
5182,"I'd heard a lot about Vida Verde from before COVID, and was excited to check this place out since it's much less crowded and easier to get into now, and the outdoor terrace space is a great option for when you don't want to dine indoors but also don't want to be out on the street or sidewalk.  The decor both indoors and out is really colorful and fun, and I appreciated the plastic partitions in between the tables.  The food here is very tasty, but I was a little surprised by how limited the menu was... maybe because of COVID?  I don't know.We shared an single order of guac ($15), which was a tasty start to the meal.  For my entree, I had the carnitas burrito ($18), which according to the menu is supposed to be served with plantains, but all I got was the burrito.  When I asked the waiter about it, he said the plantains were inside the burrito... huh??  There were no plantains in my burrito.  An $18 burrito with no side is def a bit steep, but at least it was tasty.  Pair that with a $14 classic margarita, and you've got a delicious, albeit pricey, Mexican meal."
5183,"I went to Vida Verde on a Saturday afternoon with a bunch of friends for a birthday brunch. We were seated immediately and the interior of this location was decorated nicely. It had a ""Dia de Los Muertos"" vibe to it. We did the boozy brunch and stuck to mimosas all day long, although there were options like bellini's available. The drinks were okay, but I think they were very watered down a bit. I ordered the chicken tacos and they were okay in taste, nothing that will blow you away. My girlfriend ordered the Chilaquiles (not pictured) and they were a bit underwhelming in taste. We found the DJ to be very hit or miss with his music selection. Overall a good time given we had a big group with us, but i'm not sure if I will return to this location. With a few upgrades and enhancements, Vida Verde has an opportunity to become a go-to brunch destination."
5184,"Everything about this eclectic restaurant is 5 stars!! It is not your typical Mexican restaurant, but BETTER! Once you step inside the energy is amazing; the ambiance, the decor and bright colors mixed with amazing music all make for an unique upbeat dining experience. Everyone working here we interacted with was super friendly and made the evening more enjoyable. The menu reads amazing, it took forever to decide what we wanted and the food did not disappoint, it was honestly so freaking good!! Such great flavors, nicely cooked, large portions and beautifully plated and presented. The tamarind margarita, which are hard to find, was the best I have ever had. I left highly satisfied and cannot wait to return."
5185,"I've been here a few times but needed to rave about this past visit. The food has always been amazing, as well as the drinks (which is what keeps me going back) but then you add some great service and it tops off the whole experience. The bartender, Abraham, was so lovely! He definitely was super busy but he still took time to answer our questions and have a small conversation while making drinks. Of course I'll be back!"
5186,"I have very mixed emotions on this place. First we showed up (with a reservation) and they tried to seat us at the corner on shaky stools. Meanwhile, the entire restaurant is empty because it just opened and there are empty gorgeous booths. We asked to be moved and they allowed us to so I guess that's good. Then we try to order bottomless brunch and we ask them, assuming we each get a brunch entree, can we also order apps from the rest of the menu. I asked this at least two or three times. They said yes each time. Then we tried to do that and they said only off the brunch menu... ok. Then we order guac off the brunch menu and we got two since there were 6 people and it was 52 dollars.... Never in my life have I seen or ordered two small plates of guacamole for 26 dollars each. That's just absurd. The ONLY reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is the food we ordered was really delicious and the drinks were good. They do mean bottomless here and the drinks are plentiful and filled to the brim. It is a very pretty restaurant but the service/menu system needs some work. I would consider going again."
5187,"We came for the beautiful rooftop setting, but it was closed.We were pleasantly surprised. The food was AMAZING! We got off to a slow start. The wings weren't crispy, but we sent them back and they did them right.The tacos are like no other. Cool variation. The cheese is melted in a thin layer on top of the tortilla. (That's a bad description, you just have to try it).The burrito has the plantain diced inside, never had that before. It was wonderful."
5188,"This place is good and love that they were very spacious with tables spread out. Ordered the guacamole, nachos, and yucca fries. All is a must! They were so good! Nachos were by favorite of the three. Tried the fish tacos. They were good. Prob preferred the fish to be a little on the crispy side but was still good. Staff was super nice. And love the decor!! Will def come back to try other dishes."
5189,"I was told great things about this place but the service was kinda disappointing. Not everyone's food came out at the same time so we all couldn't eat until everyone had their food. Also it was very hard to get the attention of someone for help. I understand Saturday's are probably very busy, but at the same time if people make reservations then you should be able to prepare for the amount of customers coming in. I would not recommend a friend to come here unless it's a slow day during the week. Will also add the food was good, but definitely not worth the waiting and confusion."
5190,"My girl friends and I came here to celebrate a birthday and it was the perfect place for good vibes and even better food! Definitely need to make a reservation online through their website especially on the weekends.We started off with drinks and loved the winx and hulk smash for something more light and refreshing.For the food we each got the butchers choice which is $54/person and comes with two soups, rice, egg soufflé and some pickled veggies. It was definitely worth it as the meat was high quality and the wagyu cut tasted like butter (yum!).I definitely recommend coming here for a special night out and look forward to coming back!"
5191,"I'd like to give this spot one star just like their one michelin star achievement. First of all, I would like to point out that I completely disagree with the michelin star achievement and pretty confused on how they were to receive a star. This place made me question the whole michelin star achievement criteria and its scoring system. Once you enter the reservation you will be entering into a complete chaos. There is no order but everyone just all over the place waiting for their table. There is a bar right in the middle where everyone is hovered around with no real area for you to wait - I felt very claustrophobic and uncomfortable. I understand their bottleneck structure as its to get people to order drinks while they wait but for those who don't drink is given an unpleasant waiting experience from the get go. We were seated 10 mins after our reserved time FYI so don't expect to be seated any time earlier than your scheduled reservation. The food was okay. Nothing special. But for the price of the Butcher's set in NYC its pretty cheap so you cant expect much. I am not sure if the food was supposed to be a ""fusion"", ""interpretation"" or authentic Korean BBQ experience. But was quiet surprised when one of the server called the Korean Kimchi - specifically kkakdugi (pickled spicy Korean radish) daikon radish. First of all Daikon MEANS radish so you're literally saying the same thing twice - radish radish. And the word daikon is mainly used in Japan or used to express Japanese radish as an ingredient. As many aware people should know that there has been sensitivity going around Kimchi as other countries have been trying to claim it as their traditional dish when its Korean. So using a Japanese word to explain a Korean is just plain ignorant and the establishment has provided lack of training for their employees working there. We ordered the somyun - the noodle soup and the noodles were prepared so in advance before pouring in the soup that the noodles were stuck to each other. It was evident the noodles just sat there prepared way too early. How is this good quality - let alone a michelin recommended restaurant?Because the server was too slow at cooking our meat for us we did it ourselves. If we didn't the meat was going to just burn there. The server also offered additional rounds of sides and those came almost at the end of our meal. What a waste. Then they provided four small pieces of almost dead and completely dried strawberries - Don't offer at all if you're going to provide such poor quality items. The taste of the food in general was ok. Nothing outstanding or even that memorable. I would absolutely not recommend this spot to anyone or ever return. If you like non-authentic Korean BBQ spot and want to dine in a super loud place, this is going to be your place to go."
5192,My favorite kbbq spot for the quality of meats and great sides. I am honestly very picky with my sides and I can actually eat most of it. My favorite side is the souffle eggs! They are so fluffy and divine. Also a prefect end to the evening was the icecream.The butcher's feast set with a side of the A5 Japanese wagyu is the prefect amount of foods for a table of four.I went multiple times and one of the first time we also got the wagyu paella. It was decent but that was just too much foods by the end of the night. They also have a great drink menu!
5193,"we made reservations at 9 PM for my friend's birthday and showed up about 10 minutes early. we were told the table wasn't ready so we went to the bar and ordered a few drinks. the bar is really nice with greenery and plants (real ones!!) on the walls. finally at 9:30, we were seated. they apologized for the delay - we didn't mind too much since they had the bar but it was a little upsetting since our reservation was at 9. but let's talk about the food. we ordered the butcher's feast which is priced 64/person. It comes with this amazing scallion salad that I was addicted to as well as a soft creamy egg souffle and two soups. the stews were nothing special but nice to have. the butcher's feast came with 4 meats including wagyu and some others. meat is super tender and they cook on the grill for you. dessert is included and it is this spectacular soy sauce ice cream. basically vanilla ice cream with a soy sauce caramel of sorts - never knew how much I needed this in my life!!on top of that we ordered some oysters, paella, and ""steak and eggs"".  the paella was a little too heavy for my taste as there was a lot of fat and oil along with the heavy egg yolk. oysters were super fresh and yummy but the real star of the show was the steak and eggs. this is a MUST ORDER!!!! the steak is extremely tender while the milk toast adds the perfect crunch and the caviar is the perfect touch of salt and a little pop. still thinking about how delicious it was their drinks are pricey as expected and my friends didnt enjoy theirs too much (friesling, pink star) but I ordered the ferdinand which was quite easy to drink. very pricey spot but such a fun dining experience and I can't wait to come back. I was a little irked that they didn't do anything special for my friends birthday other than a candle in the ice cream but alas"
5194,"When you walk in, greeted for proof of vaccinations and offers to check in your coat, the dimly lit hallway seems almost like a club. You can tell the ambiance is as meticulously curated as the food -- you're paying for an ~ experience ~ people!As we were a party for 2, we were only able to get reservations for the first couple of seatings or the last -- we went for an early din and got promptly seated at 5:15pm on a Wednesday. They leave you with the drink menu to sit with for a couple moments -- peruse and decide what appeals to you. In the end, we were just anxious to eat. We ordered the steak tartare to start. It was so delicious and rich! The crunchy fry of the tendon puffs topped with the dressed raw steak was the perfect mix of textures -- what a delight, honestly!Next, we got the butcher's feast for 2. We were debating between this and the omakase, but scrolled the reviews and decided to go with the option with the most sides. From the hanger steak to the aged ribeye to the american wagyu to the somewhat sweet marinated galbi -- they have perfected the order of this meal! The servers explain everything, grill everything perfectly medium rare for you and ensure that you have the best meal ever. Each cut was just so good -- rich and flavorful and wonderfully juicy.The butcher's feast also comes with 2 soups, 2 bowls of white rice, various kimchi plates, lettuce and ssam-jang to wrap your meat in, and scallion salad. It's an extraordinary amount of food for 2 people and you will surely leave full.We were told to order the kimchi wagyu paella as well -- which he mixed up for us and came out to be just about 2 bowls worth of rice. The beef was super tender and rich and the kimchi cut against its richness. Because of the sheer amount of food, we ended up taking it home as leftovers and reheating it with a fried egg on top. Made for an amazing meal for the next day! The butcher's feast ends with a soft serve with caramel sauce and it honestly stood its own. Was super good along with everything else in this meal! I'd definitely come here again and highly recommend everyone who's interested to try this place :)"
5195,"My friend tells me this place is very difficult to get a reservation at, so I jumped at the chance to dine with her on a Monday night for dinner. The restaurant was already buzzing when we arrived - there was a cool modern bar area where a couple people were grabbing just drinks. We were seated fairly quickly by a lovely gentleman at the front desk who initiated a pleasant conversation with us in the short time that we waited. However, I thought our hosts / hostesses (yes, there were multiple throughout the night) were less warm - they were still nice and attentive, but just more ""commercial"", I thought.As for the food, at the suggestion of the host we ordered the steak tartare appetizer on top of the Butcher's Feast. They actually suggested we order another savoury dish on top of the Butcher's Feast, but I was glad we did not do this on the outset because there were more than enough food in the Feast alone - we couldn't finish everything! The meat was good quality but portion was not that much - rather, you get filled up on the other dishes in the feast (kimchi stew, dwen-jeng stew with rice, salad and various side dishes). We had beers with our meal - there were only 2 on the menu I recall, so I wish they had a more extensive beer menu - especially Korean beers which would go so well with the BBQ.Bottom line, I would probably wait a while before I come back for dinner again as there are many other good Korean BBQ places in Manhattan, but it was a decent experience nonetheless."
5196,"My friends and I have tried to get a reservation a couple of times and it was impossible--I finally had to use the American Express Concierge service to help us get the reservation! We still had to book it 2 weeks in advance. If you have never had a Michelin 1 star Korean BBQ place, then this is the place to be. We ended up getting the Butcher's feast. It comes with four cuts of meat, banchan, rice, and soups. The cuts of meat were hanger steak, dry-aged rib eye, American Wagyu, and galbi. We felt satisfied after our meal. The meats were cooked to perfection. I liked the sides and the banchan as well. It completes the Korean BBQ experience.You can also order other fancier cuts of meat. We considered doing the steak omakase, but we thought the Butcher's feast was a good deal for $64 pp. I did my research before coming here and watched some YouTube videos. Their Fisherman's Welcome looks really appetizing as well, I will try that next time I visit. They also have an extensive wine list. I recommend trying their wines to pair with your delicious meal.One highlight of their restaurant is the service, which was superb. I thought it was a little loud in the restaurant though, so it was difficult at times to hear what the server was saying.  Overall, I recommend giving this place a try if you ever visit New York City or you live in the area!"
5197,"Dined with 3 friends and shared two appetizers: Steak Tartare, and Korean ""Bacon"". I enjoyed the tendon puffs with the tartare, but my friends unanimously agreed that the ""bacon"" was the more unique dish. While the appetizers were tasty, they were quite small and expensive, so I'd probably skip out on them if I were to go back. For our entree, we got the Butcher's Feast for 4 ($64/p). The Butcher's Feast featured four different cuts of meats, an egg soufflé, stews and ice cream! Our server cooked our meats to a perfect medium rare, and I enjoyed all the cuts. Unfortunately, he had seasoned one of our cuts a little too salty, but paired with the side dishes, it was still good!My Korean friend told me that all the ban-chan and stews were very authentic. While we weren't terribly hungry, it ended up being enough food for us, but do note there's not a lot of meat. If you eat a lot, I would consider getting an additional meat or two. The soft serve was the perfect way to end the meal, and the soy sauce caramel is one of the most unique flavors that I've had. Super pricy (even for KBBQ!) place, but a pretty nice way to celebrate a special occasion."
5198,"Came to Cote last month and it started off rough with our reservation but management took care of us and the rest of the night was history :) I'll explain...Cote opens up reservations a month in advance! They have a few time slots but if your party is 4 or less, you're only allowed to book 5,5:15 or 10,10:15 so FYI. I had booked an indoor reservation for 5:15 and when my party and I arrived, we were told the reservation was only available for the outside. This was rather disappointing for a few reasons. 1) it was like 40 degrees.. 2) we were about to pay $200+ to sit outside 3) we booked an indoor reservation. I was pretty down but after 30 ish min of shuffling, the manager was able to get us a table inside. I know how hard it is when unexpected issues come up and I felt like they handled everything with such grace and respect. Food was amazing. Hard to think about Korean bbq as being fancy but that's exactly what Cote is. The kimchi paella was bomb, and I was so full by the end of the meal that I could barely walk. Def worth checking out if you're in NY and have something to celebrate. Drinks are good too :)"
5199,"I love Korean bbq so when I heard there is a 1 star Michelin krn bbq.. well I had to try it!!!We booked a 9 o'clock cause that's all that was available and my kids sleep at 8:30.. BUT... NO REGRETS When on vacation schedules go out the window. There is a cool meat locker downstairs  with age dried meat that my husband thought was so cool.Every piece of meat was delicious. The salad was sooooooooo good! My kids enjoyed it to, I think we ordered to much food. I wish they had a better choice of dessert but everything else (drinks, food, etc.) was good!And of course one of the most important things for me- the bathrooms were clean! Service was good and everyone was attentive and polite! They took my coat and greater us and gave my kids cool little glow up rings.During these wacky times, you do have to show your vaccine cards."
5200,"My family was in from out of town last week and were referred to Hometown for dinner.  The ordering process was a little sloppy but the food was outstanding.  Brisket was very tender and juicy, probably the best sausage I've ever had.  The chicken and sides were top notch.  I love BBQ and have had it all over the country, and I would put this at the top.  My kids don't love it as much and all were asking if we could go back."
5201,"Visited on weekday night. Place was lightly packed. Plenty of street parkings available. The waiter checked our vaccination card. This place is pretty self-service restaurant. Low-key, southern style interior.I grew up in Texas, up to undergrad. I really have to say... that this place is better than most of bbq places in Texas. I visited Texas a week after visiting here. I still think this place is better than most of them. Brisket was so tender and juicy. Baby rack rib was incredibly good. Well cooked, very well spiced. Sausage was okay but im not a fan of sausages, so i cant comment too much on the sausage. Mac and cheese and cole slaw was mediocre. My mac and cheese was kind of hard. Cornbread was very good. It's not one of those ultra sweet cornbreadI would definitely recommend to visit."
5202,"Food 4.0/5.0Service 3.5/5.0Value 3.0/5.0Decor 3.0/5.0Overall 4.0/5.0Really good BBQ. Everything was done well -- importantly, including the brisket. The wings were interesting. Service at the counter. Everything felt like I was in TX, aside from the prices (I don't mind, just keep it going!). Curious about why the Asian/Korean-inspired items. Would come back."
5203,"My opinion is 3/10. NYC bbq unfortunately fails to compare to the south. Most good bbq places offer a slice show off there product even for a $2-4 a slice. Amazing places will show you there product for free . Here at Hometown that is not the case. If you just want the meat the minimum buy in is $15  for 1/2 lbs.I luckily got cool customer service and got them to give me a 1/4 lbs for $10 don't expect that all the time.  The meat is super moist, but the meat tasted bland and unseasoned no flavor from the grill or smoker lol, as you should in BBQ. It tasted more like roast beef then brisket . (Usually a sign of bad BBQ )Check out my in depth video reviews on any of the platforms below.

5204,"Not going to lie, I'm pretty frustrated with this place. We were at a bar down the street and decided after our last round of drinks that BBQ sounded delightful. I called ahead to see how busy they were at the time and the person on the phone urged us to come immediately to secure a spot for 5 people. We dashed over here, literally within 5-10 minutes after our call as we were literally a block away. Upon arrival, we were told by a guy at the door that they were completely out of meat/food. Let me repeat that: They were out. of. food. I'm sorry, but it is 7:30pm on a Saturday night and you're telling me you're completely out of food? Not only that but we were instructed to run over here to dine. I find it hard to believe you had food when I called 10 minutes prior. Why would you even tell us to come? We then had a conversation with one of the staff who advised that this happens WEEKLY. It is just completely baffling to me that a restaurant like this would be so ill prepared on such a regular basis- especially on a Saturday night?! Shouldn't that be one of the best paying nights for restaurants? How is this a successful business model? I do hope to try the food, once they actually have some for us to try- but as for now I'm just left with this bitter taste in my mouth. 2/5"
5205,"Overpriced and overrated, sorry,I gave them multiple chances but still, it's just not good.$13 for three wings. No.The wings were overcooked, dry, and it felt like they were thawed from a deep freezer.Never again."
5206,"Some of the best barbecue I've ever had! If you're coming for the first time the employees are really helpful and friendly. Let them know what you're interested in and they will give you really good suggestions on what to order. I went with the pulled pork sandwich, a side of Mac and cheese and their banana pudding for dessert. You order first and then grab a table with a number so your food can come when it's ready. The sides are ready and given to you at the register, but your main dishes may take some time since it's made fresh. We came soon after they opened and there was still a short line. The line moves fast, but sometimes it may get busy. The food was all delicious and their sticky sauce is truly one of a kind."
5207,"So many great spots in Brooklyn and having had the best in Texas had to check this BBQ spot out.  Also, saw the Lamb Banh Mi on Burgers, Brews and Que and was curious.Rustic spot with a laid back vibe.  A good size bar area with added tables in the back & plenty of outdoor seating.  They were semi busy on a Friday afternoon around1:00.   Order at the counter and they call you when your food is ready.  Unfortunately call-in for pickup or online ordering are not available at this location.  Decided to have the Banh Mi on-site and ordered some Brisket and Sausage to go.As a Banh Mi fan I wasn't sure about Lamb as the protein.  That said, the Lamb Belly didn't disappoint-had just the right bite & smoke without being gamey.  Veggies with the pickled Daikon and Hot/sweet sauce take it over the top.  Nicely balanced sandwich and so rich I could only eat half.  A must try!Paired it with the Threes Vliet (local Pilsner) which was crisp & refreshing.Brisket (got the fatty) and Billy's House made Sausage were both excellent and on par with some of the Texas spots I've enjoyed.  Corn bread was buttery and tasty.Service at the counter was friendly and the lady at the bar was upbeat & helpful with the beer selections.I would imagine they can get quite busy especially when the weather is good but it was a rainy day when I visited.   Will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.  Don't miss the ""one of a kind"" Lamb Banh Mi!"
5208,Very expensive! Best way to order if your in a group is for the table and let everyone share $50+ for this food. Also I WAITED IN LINE FOR 1 HOUR AND 45 MINUTES
5209,"Is it punishable by law that I've never written a review for Hometown? It's quite possible. However there's much more illegal things I've done and gotten away with so this can slide too. As someone whose traveled around the country looking for amazing barbecue, I can attest that this is easily the best in New York City. Hands down. It's on par with some places in Texas. I'm not saying better, but could be as good as some. Let's not get crazy here. What to get? Everything. The pork belly and brisket are musts. The sides are fantastic too, but if you're going for the first time and deciding between more meat and a side, go for the meat. Pre pandemic I highly recommended you think about what time you want to eat and arrive an hour before hand. You can get drinks while you wait in line. Unless you're by yourself, which is cool too, but you won't have anyone to hold your spot. Nowadays you place your order for pickup. Not sure if it's staying this way or what ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, but with winter coming they're gonna have to figure that out. But the choice of where to go to for barbecue in NYC should be an easy one. It's Hometown or nothing."
5210,"One of the best hidden spots in town. Always recommend non-NYC residents to come here if they could. It's a bit aways down in the bungalows of Red Hook. But if you make it you it, please try the whole menu... It's all good!All the meats have great smoke and great flavor. My faves are the brisket, mac and cheese, collard greens and corn bread. Generally those are my go-to's at a BBQ joint too. Bring a large group too because there is a lot of dishes worth savoring Cheers"
5211,"This place is amazing!! We ended up here yesterday for a late lunch and omg I am so impressed. They have the menu up on the wall, and there are great selections, a variety but not too much as to where you would be concerned with freshness.I had the htbc sandwich and it slaps as the kids say. Smoked turkey, jam, tomatoes, lettuce and Mayo on Texas toast. I hossed so much of this tasty sandwich.We also had some awesome sides, the coleslaw was flavorful and crunchy, the cornbread was perfect and slathered in a honey butter, the potato salad was awesome and had something slightly vinegary about it which I loved, the greens were cooked to perfection! I tried the pulled pork sandwich it was awesome, with just the right amount of sauce, also had some bites of the lamb bah mi, and a bbq version of lamb is awesome.Had to have cocktails because Sunday, and I had the house margarita which was fresh and not with that mix that kills your stomach and also had a vodka martini that was very tasty.All around great experience and this is a place I would certainly visit again given the chance."
5212,"We got the spare ribs and the pastrami sandwich. Prices are definitely on the high side, and they only do online ordering so be prepared to order in advance. Also, quite frankly they are in the middle of nowhere. But the food...it's good.The pastrami sandwich is arguably better than Katz's because the bread is heavily buttered and toasted and the pastrami is fattier. The spare ribs were just good quality ribs, nothing special -if you're used to Texas BBQ you will be heavily disappointed. Still the best ribs I have had in the city.Mild annoyance with the service -they had some picnic tables marked as reserved, but nobody was sitting there, so lots of people including us sat down as the tables were in the shade. After we were halfway through eating someone came by and made everyone clear out. Also, there's no bathroom, just a port a potty."
5213,"Some standout items, to be sure -- but I'd honestly been hoping for a little more out of my first experience at Hometown. Waited for about an hour which seems like the standard, before ultimately getting to try a number items from the menu with the party we were with. My favorites were the spare ribs and the Italian sausage (surprisingly). Wanted a bit more from the brisket and queso  -- the former of which was tasty, but like a lot of the by-the-pound items we ordered, quite cold when the served them to us."
5214,"es they have the Trinity of smoked meats, but it's the outside the box food concepts that ends up being the real treat. Who would have guessed the best taco I'd ever eaten was at a BBQ joint in Brooklyn! It's pretty clear that the owner, Billy, takes a lot of pride in his restaurants because we saw him go out of his way to make guests comfortable AND the place was close to spotless. I'm sure seating was tough for a little while, but the outdoor spaces they created were perfect. Back to the food, it's a ton of amazing flavor mixed with backstory. You eat a kimchi taco because that food meant something to Billy growing up. All his plates have a story like that and it's 100% worth it to ask him about them if you catch him. Great stories with even greater tastes. Don't go in expecting only smoked meats and don't pass up the charge to try something you hadn't planned to, because it's ALL GREAT!When your done eating, go down to RedHook Tavern for a drink and incredible dessert. If you're lucky, Rebecca and Daniel will be working when you go in. They are awesome.Needles to say, Billy's restaurants are more than worth the price of admission. Our evening eating at both places and meeting the awesome team at both locations was one of our favorite dining experiences we've ever had. Just take a couple minutes to look around and notice how well done every little thing is. Billy and his team have countless history lessons for you about the restaurants, the incredible renovation of Red Hook Tavern, and the history of their foods (this was really cool).I'm really glad we got to go spend time in Billy Durney's Brooklyn Restaurants. I can't  recommend enough that you do the same!"
5215,"Place is a little pricey, but the meat is great for the most part. We got the brisket, turkey and lamb sandwich. The brisket had a lot of extra fat which none of us wanted to eat. The turkey was amazing light, soft and flavorful. The lamb sandwich was mouth watering. Also had some non alcoholic beer since I was driving."
5216,"One of those places that I consistently visit when meeting with friends or when spending time with family. I really like their food, also drinks, without further ado, just amazing! The atmosphere is also great, the service is also great, some compliments. But guys, I ask you, please do something with the price tag for some items, sometimes I look at them and feel that this is an overprice!"
5217,"I've been here several times over the years and now believe that this place has gone far downhill at an accelerating pace. Absurdly small portions (pastrami sandwiches) of greasy, fatty pastrami for $28 each. They used to serve better quality, more reasonably portioned meals, but now you order yourself via your phone and pick it up at their stand in the doorway and they seem to hide behind that relative anonymity of the situation and not having customers interact with a server who'd bring you a plate with the underwhelming fare on it. Very disappointed. Recommend seeking out the alternative BBQ joints at this point."
5218,"I will preface this review with a disclaimer: I fell in love with midwestern style BBQ while in the Mecca of sorts, Kansas City, MO! Once you have had that level of smoky, juicy goodness, one's palate is automatically changed, even elevated. Consequently, Hometown Bar-B-Que did not quite hit the mark.I went on a beautifully sunny afternoon where there was no wait and the staff was super attentive more-so than at other restaurants that were offering grab-and-go type outdoor dining. Even given those pluses, I was underwhelmed. We ordered both fatty and lean brisket cuts which were quite juicy but missing rich smoky flavor that I have grown accustomed to. The Mac & cheese and collard greens were bland as well. There was no black pepper or hot sauce on hand so everything had to be eaten as is.I would hope that I caught them on a day where they were  running low on seasoning and had to be sparse with everything as a result. Though it seems like I may have had this restaurant bookmarked for too long and missed them at their peak a couple years ago."
5219,"We stopped by this restaurant for lunch before heading to IKEA -- the IKEA ferry dropped us off in Red Hook and I'd say it was about a 10 minute walk over to Hometown. It was a Saturday, so understandably, all the tables were full.  There were two huge coolers available with ice cold water, which I appreciated! You can also pick up plastic silverware and napkins (as well as wet wipes).Pro tip: Definitely order ahead for pick-up so you don't have to wait for your food. Another pro tip: Find a table (they all have umbrellas to block the sun) before you pick up your food! I almost settled for sitting on a bench (at least it was under the shade), but it definitely would not have worked out because barbecue is messyyy.I ordered a chicken taco and a small side of mac & cheese. The taco was pretty tasty as well as the mac! I tried a bit of the baby back ribs, and they were decent! They come with a smattering of green onions on the bottom though, which was an interesting flavor (not my fave). If you are in the area, this is a solid spot for a meal, but I can't say I'd go out of my way to come to Red Hook for it!"
5220,"They have turned online dining to omnichannel experience. You purchase everything online visit and they bring out food upon arrival. I went in early December on a mid 50s day and it perfect for outdoor eating. The service was extremely good and the staff was kind. Even finding park nearby was a breeze. The food was really good BBQ. Not one complaint. My friend thought the corn bread was tough but thats my preference. The Mac and cheese with queso conceptually sounded crazy but it really worked! The brisket was by far my favorite, melted in your mouth upon contact. Only thing stopping myself from a perfect rating is the portable bathrooms. They don't allow you inside to their restrooms. It's just a horrid experience to have before eating at your establishment."
5221,"We always love going to this restaurant when we visit our family in New York. The food is just amazing and taste so fresh and just made. The brisket is my favorite, it is just unlike any brisket I've ever had. I love the sides and unfortunately this time the collard greens had sold out. We love the collard greens and really haven't found any tasted like theirs. The pastrami bacon it was just so so good. The only problem is, especially when you have children with you, is the wait time. 45 minutes in line is pretty long. I wish that they could improve that."
5222,"Eaten here a few times and it was excellent. The brisket and baked beans were my favorite. The corn bread was pretty delicious and huge, 2 people can totally share one piece. Pulled pork, pastrami and jerk ribs were very good. Also really enjoyed the collard greens, sorry vegetarians there's a ton of pork in them. Nice atmosphere and good drink selection, all around thumbs up!"
5223,"The brisket. I dream about the brisket. The brisket is my friend, my enemy, my everything.They have other dishes, don't get me wrong. But THE BRISKET.Now for the fine print:I actually prefer the smaller location in Industry City.If you go to this location, you'll get awesome views, and more selection for food, but you'll have a long wait. Could be 50 min, could be forever.You can get the same *amazing* brisket, at their smaller location in Industry city. Sure, you'll miss out on the beef rib, but the wait will be cut in half. Half the time, twice the brisket, right?Debating between Korean Sticky Ribs and the ""regular"" spare ribs? I prefer the ""regular"" ones. They slid right off.I'll go to bed dreaming about this brisket again, like every night."
5224,"Another amazing meal. Too bad they were out of the wonderful cornbread (basically honey sweetened, corny fluffy cakes). Don't make the mistake of going in person before ordering. Orders are ONLY taken through the Toast Takeout app (as of August 2021). Then come pick up in 25+ minutes as specified. Buy some drinks at the cashier (card only) and chow down at a picnic table. @ lamb banh mi - meat was tasty, like pulled lamb, and pickled veges are nice, but probably not worth the price especially with the brisket on the menu@ brisket - if there was one reason to come here, it's this (and the cornbread). Love the fatty bits, so tender and lovingly smoked. Goes perfectly with the bbq and hot sauce, both a bit sweet, flavorful, nothing like the typical bottled versions.@ boyland rootbeer and ginger ale - beverage selection was a big lacking if you're not looking for a beer or specialty carbonated drinkWalk around the area, take a look at the statue of liberty, walk 10 minutes to IKEA."
5225,"We had another great meal here. We came with a group of four and ordered way too much: a pound of brisket, a beef rib, 1/2 pound of pulled pork, two slices of pastrami bacon, cauliflower, mac & cheese, pinto beans, collard greens, and corn bread. I'm sure I will doubt myself on this next time around, but we all agreed we don't need brisket next time -- the beef rib is by far my favorite item here, and it's absolutely enormous, and my wife loves the pulled pork, so the brisket almost felt superfluous. The beef rib is really incredible -- among the best BBQ items I've had anywhere. On the sides -- mac & cheese is a must, and the the cauliflower is maybe the very best one. The beans and corn bread are great too. I really liked the bacon as well."
5226,"Flavorless, cold Brisket and Pulled pork, both had to be drowned with their BBQ sauces to be fit for human consumption.""Korean Ribs"" was an abomination - dry and salty. Chili was good as well as the mac and cheese. BBQ in the midwest and south is tough to beat."
5227,"The brisket here is still the best I've had in the NYC area and that's from a former Texan. The other things here are not so good, at least not in 2020. I could eat a ton of this brisket and the cornbread too but the queso Mac and cheese was a little off and the banana pudding tasted like 2020, sour and like it's overstayed it's welcome.Despite that disappointment in sides (and that lil banana pudding sets you back twice more than a ""delicious bakery"" banana pudding of the same size) I'll order this again when I have my brisket craving once more. It happens, especially since I can't actually visit Texas so safely right now.Definitely a go for the meats here."
5228,"WOW! Worth the hype and drive from jersey! We ordered online (took around 30 min), picked up right at the door, and ate in the car. If you are eating in the car, be sure to grab the plates, forks and napkins that they have out! (Pack some wet wipes!) The brisket was out of this world! Super tender and soft. The Mac and cheese with queso was delicious! My husband loved his brisket sandwich. He said the bread was also delicious. The cornbread tasted like generic cornbread. Will definitely be back!!!"
5229,"Come. Onnnn. This barbecue absolutely SLAPS!A friend and I were in Red Hook last weekend and originally wanted to try the Red Hook Lobster Pound. After us realizing it was a 2 hour wait, she suggested this spot as the best BBQ in New York - so of course I was game. You order online and pick it up. Our order took 1 hour. We got the Half Roasted Chicken and also the Brisket. HOT DAMN! FLAVOR! TENDERNESS! SMOKINESS! Just an absolute pleasure to eat.I loved that the chicken came with an incredible zingy green sauce (ask for extra) and pickled red onions. What a great pairing! The 3 different BBQ sauces that came with our brisket were very good but I usually prefer a super duper spicy one so I know I'm just an oddball there. However all the meats were truly above average. But overall I'm just dying to go back! Best barbecue I've ever had in my entire life."
5230,"3.5 stars, got a brisket taco and lamb belly banh mi delivered. The brisket taco was not good, there was barely anything in it and wasn't juicy at all (see pic). However, the lamb belly banh mi was delicious. There was so much meat and the meat was super juicy and flavorful."
5231,"Returned here for the first time in a few years and I'm sorry to say that it was disappointing. I don't know if it's gone downhill, or if it's because of the pandemic. I started with smoked turkey. Suffice to say that while it was tender, it had absolutely zero taste of smoke in it at all and I've had many a smoked turkey in my life. I then had the brisket, which at this place has always been to die for. While it also was tender, it also lacked the usual smokiness and the herbs and spices in the bark that I always remembered. Just a mediocre brisket.Lastly, had a spare ribs. Also tender so they had been in the smoker for an adequate time, but again lacking in taste. You could see by looking at them that they lacked very much bark. I will probably return at some point because maybe this was just an off day, but for me this is over an hour drive."
5232,"Turned into a food truck Order on their website  only , and wait 1.5 hours for your food and sit on a picnic table and piss in a poets potty But at least everyone is very safe from Covid after vaccine shots"
5233,"Pro tip: outdoor dining requires an online order anyway, so order an hour or so before you plan on eating. They will text you when the pickup is ready.Friends have raved about this place, and while there are a couple of dishes that I wish I could have tried (lamb bahn mi), I think I got enough of their standards that leave me confused to the ravings. Sausage: this was a unique combination of flavors, and one flavor note seems to be cheese (pimento). It's not the classic fat-bursting sausage, so just be prepared for that.Brisket: very tender and worth getting, but probably needs the accompanied sauces, which is very tasty (BBQ sauce and what seems like a mango habanero sauce)Korean Ribs: tender and flavorful, worth getting but not a must-haveMac & Cheese with queso: personally, I didn't think the queso added much to the mac & cheese, and this falls in line with the mediocre mac & cheese in NYColeslaw: this was perhaps the most disappointing, barely any flavor involved in this side"
5234,"This is a review for what's currently their outdoor seating area.CONS:Off the bat, really disappointed that they do not have any indoor dining at all. That was not made clear at all on the website, and I wouldn't have chosen to eat here after a long day on Governor's Island if I had known that. During the middle of a heat wave, the last thing I wanted was to sit in the beating sun with a big group and just a little bit of shade covering the tables. The wooden picnic tables were burning hot. When I asked about indoor seating, I was told after Labor Day. Not sure what excuse they have for not providing indoor seating during the peak of NYC summer.Indoor bathrooms at least? Forget about it. They literally have a blockade of tables and coolers so no one walks past the door into their extremely air conditioned lobby area. Instead, I was pointed in the direction of two port-a-pottys. Port-a-pottys in 90 degree heat in NYC? I would rather wait it out until my bladder burst than step inside there. Again, wasn't really given a clear excuse. Was just told after Labor Day. This, I have to say is inexcusable. Even peak pandemic of last summer, most places had the decency to let patrons use indoor bathrooms. Not this one.In terms of the food, the $14 watery canned rosé I had was not worth the price along with the $6 soggy slaw.PROS:The turkey sandwich was well seasoned and the bread was crispy. Was a solid sandwich, but honestly could only eat half because I was melting just sitting there. Saved the other half for dinner.--Overall, not worth the hype, and especially not worth it right now. Not sure if I would even go back when indoor dining there does open up because the staff had such a lackluster attitude when I expressed my disappointment. I don't really write reviews unless I feel strongly about a place, and I definitely felt that way about Hometown. All around, just a disappointment."
5235,"First time visiting New York & first time eating at Hometown.. I've had Texas BBQ before, so I wasn't expecting much, just good BBQ.. Man, was I wrong!! Hometown BBQ was on point!! Their brisket, ribs & homemade sausages was so delicious, u can easily compare it to Texas BBQ.. If u are ever in Brooklyn, definitely hit up Hometown.. U won't be disappointed!!"
5236,"So after my initial review I was contacted by Hometown Bar-B-Que and they wanted me to give them another shot. I'm glad I did because honestly the first time really made me sad, I frequent Fairway a lot and for HT-BBQ to be right there I can always swing by and grab some food. Luckily I took Mitchell up on his offer and I have to tell you the food was some of the juiciest, freshest BBQ I've had. This time the meat was succulent, oozing with juice and steaming hot when I got it, The Brisket was so tender that you could break it up with a spoon. Oozing with juices and smokiness it was the perfect combination of fatty smokey meats. The Whole smoked chicken was plump, juicy and hot, the Korean BBQ Ribs really shone this time, lots of meat and sauce. These were done right and weren't bone dry. I would order these again. Corn bread was delicious. At $5 a square It seems a bit pricy but its the quality you're paying for. I highly recommend it. Mac N Cheese was good as well, although it could use a bit more cheese. This time the macaroni was cooked all the way through and the textures really were amazing. The Bacon really was a winner in my book, perfectly smokey and salty it was a perfect appetizer. juicy fatty pieces with lots of porky flavor it was one of my favorites. All in all Hometown BBQ does BBQ well, they don't overly salt their food and let the smoke shine through. BBQ can't be mass produced so the prices reflect the work and effort that goes into each item. You will pay a bit more for Hometown but the craftsmanship and devotion to each bite you take is the reason for it. _______________________________________________"
5237,"ALL of the food is amazing. The brisket was super tender and fatty, the lamb banh mi was packed with meat, the jerk ribs were perfectly seasoned, the mac and cheese is creamy, and the corn bread is (of course) the perfect BBQ side. The sandwiches are ENORMOUS and filled with meat. There is a great selection of beer/wine/ciders and a few mixed drinks; the spiked Arnold Palmer was tasty and refreshing, but a little weak for $13. We came for lunch on a Saturday and got here a few minutes before they opened at noon; definitely a good call because the tables filled up right when they opened."
5238,Quite bullshit when you can cancel an order at 9:52 for a pick up at 10. Especially when you're an obscure place and people need to make arrangements ahead of time to make a pick up. Bullshit ownership. Bullshit management.
5239,"There are good reasons why you shouldn't trust the review of any one particular yelper for any one particular restaurant, but I'm confident that my review of Hometown BBQ is the last opinion you'll need.I'm a huge Texas BBQ fan and have tried all the well-known BBQ places in NYC (plus a few others in the tri-state area), as well as Dallas and Austin.In NYC, Hometown BBQ is #1, not close.First, let's look at the other BBQ places in NYC. If Hometown BBQ is a 10, here's how it would compare to all the other BBQ joints:Mighty Quinn: 6 - Beef rib here is great and cheaper than other places, but brisket can be dry. The fatty brisket does not have the fat interwoven into the meat, it's just clumps of fat sitting on top of fairly dry brisket.Blue Smoke: 5 - Quite good, though nothing really stands out, also quite expensive, plus the decor and style is not your typical BBQ restaurant, more of a sit-down full service dining experience.Fette Sau: 4 - Why would you ever leave your brisket out in the open, basking under a freaking lamp?! and not surprisingly, DRY brisket.Dinosaur BBQ: 4 - Again DRY brisket.The Strand: 4 - Like Fette Sau, why would you ever leave your brisket out in the open, basking under a freaking lamp?! and not surprisingly, DRY brisket.Hill Country BBQ: 3 - Not bad overall, but again DRY brisket.Dallas BBQ: -3 - Not a typo, this place deserve a negative 3, you literally can't pay me to eat here.As you might have noticed, you judge a Texas BBQ joint by how good their brisket is, because it is so damn hard to cook a good brisket!It's a cheap meat that is extremely prone to drying out, and most restaurant f it up royally. And yet, somehow, Hometown has done it, in Brooklyn of all places. The brisket here is moist, juicy, with marbling still interwoven in the meat (a sign that the brisket is not just fatty, but also tender). You can tug on the brisket without it falling apart, but also has a nice bounce to it. The meat is tightly packaged and taken out momentarily to be sliced and put back right away to maintain the moisture. Oh yeah, and everything else there is pretty good too.Unfortunately, they are currently still not open for in-door dining, and for the full experience, you really need to order at the counter where they give you free samples cut right off the brisket (that first bite is heavenly). The way they do it now, wrapping it up like a take out really takes away from the experience quite a bit."
5240,"Not the best Mexican out there, but great value for a Michelin star restaurant and the flavors are certainly unique. Nestled in an unassuming storefront off Vernon Blvd, only the periodic lines outside would give away the bustling scene inside. The interior is quite plain and lacks the intimate sophistication for a true date spot, but the taco spices and the sauce in the Mole de Piaxtla make up for it. Small portions, so make sure to get some Guac and ceviche to share!"
5241,"We came here at 5:20PM on a Sunday, and it was already packed (opening at 5PM). We were getting quoted an hour wait, but they were able to find counter seating for the two of us. They start off with 3 salsas and the Mexican snacks that's airy and deep-fried - I don't know the name of it, but it's the ones that are sold everywhere in Mexican supermarkets and by the carts in LA/NYC.We got the ceviche de pescado ($21), tostadas de jaiba ($21), and mole de piaxtla ($25), along with the two desserts available - flan and tres leches, both for $9 each.The ceviche comes with 5-6 tortilla chips and is extremely limey, which was a nice palette cleanser to the mole. My girlfriend really liked it, and she has more of a taste for sour flavors than I do. The tostadas de jaiba came in a portion of 3, and the crab top was also refreshing, although I was slightly disappointed because I was expecting something more indulgent/mayo-based (my own fault though).We got the mole entree (vs. the enchilada, but the waitress told us it's pretty much the same thing). The chicken was spectacularly tender for both the white and dark meat, and the mole was deeply flavored although I think Ruta Oaxaca's mole is better, but their chicken is much, much drier compared to Casa Enrique. The entree comes with seasoned rice as well.BUT THE BEST WAS YET TO COME. The desserts exceeded all of the dishes that we had. I'm a big fan of both tres leches and flan, and these two were definitely some of the best I've ever had. The tres leches was sufficiently drowning in liquid, and there was a slight alcohol (tequila?) taste that complemented the creamy, milky sweetness. The flan had the perfect texture, and the flavor was custardy as you would want (I have to reconsider the flan in Lety's Bakery in Jackson Heights as to whether it's the best in NYC)."
5242,"An authentic Mexican joint in the cute little neighborhood of Long Island City that also happens to have a Michelin star? And they serve brunch?!? Casa Enrique knocked it out of the park!No reservations for brunch but we were first in line at 10:45 (opens at 11) and were greeted and seated promptly at 11. They really utilized their outdoor seating space well and it was fun to watch the people of the neighborhood walk by as we devoured our meals.Highly recommend starting with the guacamole. I used some of the house salsas (served in mild, medium and hot) to spice my bites up a bit and it was awesome.For brunch they serve a nice mix of Mexican style brunch items. Someone in our group went for the chorizo and egg torta and said it was outstanding. I stole a bite and concurred. I went to the lunch side of brunch and did the chicken verde enchiladas. The handmade tortillas were so great and the homemade verde sauce had tons of flavor.Finished off the meal with a cafe con leche that was expertly made and pepped me up for our afternoon of wandering around LIC. Can't recommend this place enough and I haven't even tried dinner service yet!"
5243,"Casa Enrique has been on my list for a good amount of time! I'm glad to have been able to come here with a few friends this past week!Casa Enrique is a no reservations, first-come first serve seating. That being said, you should expect to wait a bit for a table if you come during peak dinner hours. (also having a michelin star for 5 years doesn't make it any easier :P)We came here around 6:30 on a Wednesday night and waited around 1.5 hours before being seated. They have a bar that you could stay at while you wait for a table. Here's a list of what we ordered w/ pictures to go along with them:Guacamole - really fresh and delicious. One of the best guacamole I've ever had.Sopecitos de Chorizo - not bad! Great as a starter.Ostiones Empanizados - fried oyster with chili mayo. Also an excellent starter! Ceviche - Can never wrong with starting with ceviche. It's not as citrusy as the other ones I've had, but I personally liked it.Carne Asada - We got our made medium-rare. The dish was cooked perfectly! The flavors are not over/under seasoned, it was just the perfect amount.Brazino al Pastor - probably the best branzino I've ever had! Again the flavors were not overpowering, but rather it was just the right amount. Enchiladas de Pollo con Mole de Piaxtla - I haven't really had mole before all too much. It was a bit more on the flavorful side for me. Then again I believe moles are made for that very reason.Mole de Piaxtla - Similar to above the mole was a bit too much flavor for me. However the chicken and rice was great. Chicken was very tender.Drinks -Coconut MojitoMargarita on the Rocks Noches Buena MezcalI'm not usually one to like mojitos, but the coconut mojito here is definitely an exception! The margarita on the rocks is definitely a good standard straight forward drink. No less expectations! Noches Buena Mezcal also a good choice. No complaints really with any of the drinks.Overall a really good experience here at Casa Enrique. Highly recommend the carne asada and branzino al pastor. I wished we had tried the tacos they had but we already ordered so much. Definitely would be returning back for that. The service was also outstanding, I would not expect any less!"
5244,"TLDR: Great spot for elevated Mexican fare! 10/10 recommend trying their drinks. They're very refreshing and fun. We started off with the guacamole which I was surprised at how not spicy the ""hottest"" option was. But it was tasty nonetheless. The ceviche and fish tacos were the highlight of the meal for me. Both were made with high quality fish and felt very fresh. The tres leches was a solid dessert but felt like something was off about the texture."
5245,"Mannnnn this restaurant is so dope! Classy environment with affordable food. Michelin Star recipient for the past 7 years and well earned. We ordered Guac to start - asked for extra spicy and these guys delivered! Not just jalapeños sprinkled on top, rather a great overall kick. I had the Carne Asada and Fried Mahi Mahi Tacos. Both 5/5 - if you love Hot Sauce, highly recommend topping tacos off with there homemade sauce. I would buy the bottle if possible! I am not a fan of Chicken Mole but let me tell you this dish was the best I've had. Chicken cooked to perfection (slides off the bone) and mole sauce is a perfect addition to the Spanish rice. 5/5! Vegetarian MoleDona Blanca Enchiladas are sooo good! Mushrooms and a guacamole sauce on top! Not easy to make tasty vegetarian dishes but I would come here just for that - Amazing flavor. Try the Mozzarella Ice Cream for dessert. Very different. Definitely never had anything like it.  Service was great, drinks were good. At this price I you'll probably catch me here once a week from here on out. See y'all soon!"
5246,"I came to Casa Enrique last Friday and I can honestly say that this restaurant's 1 Michelin Star is definitely worth the ranking. Everything was absolutely on point and worth it (even if I am vegetarian).I arrived with my girlfriend around 8PM and it was already packed. Since they do not take reservations, I had to wait in the 90 degree weather outside until a table opened up. My girlfriend and I waited about 30 minutes for a table for 2 to open up. In that 30 min time frame, the line exponentially grew to about 15 people behind me.Once I got to my table, I was greeted by a very polite waiter. Really loved his service (5/5). We started with a couple of Pacifico beers and a Chips and Guacamole. I can honestly say that the Guacamole that was made fresh was delicious. I believe the chips were made in house and were so delicious. I highly recommend them.For the main course I had Chile Rolleno. All I can say is that the tomato sauce was absolutely delicious, the chihuahua cheese was amazing and I ate the whole thing so fast and am still craving it. 5/5 for sure in my books. My girlfriend had the Tacos Veganos. I had a bite and they were okay. I would give those a 3/5. For dessert we got their homemade coffee ice cream. It was very good and we thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a perfect finish to our meal on a hot summer night.I would recommend everyone to come to Casa Enrique as it is worth your time. Although the wait is a bit long, the staff is super nice and the food is superb. Can't wait to come back in the future for that Chile Rolleno and Chips and Guac!!!"
5247,"Casa Enrique remains flawless. My boyfriend and I arrived at around 7 pm on a Friday (no reservations as of early June) and waited about 45 minutes - so not too bad. We ordered:+ Frozen watermelon margarita - this was a special, amazing+ Guava caipirinha - also tasty  + Passionfruit mojito - great+ Chicken enchiladas - delicious + Pastor tacos - delicious x 2 + Carne Asada - perfect + Tres leches - great  Upping my rating to 5 stars!!"
5248,Best tres leche hands down. Really delicious (although limited) vegan options and you have to get some classic margaritas.
5249,"It's not easy to earn a Michelin star, and it seems Mexican restaurants have an even harder time breaking through that glass ceiling. But here's a notable exception. Enrique's checks all the boxes...great service, innovative cuisine, and lovely atmosphere. There were seven of us and they quickly accommodated our party by placing two tables together. We all ordered different menu items which gave us all a great indication of their offerings, and dare I say not one complaint left any of our lips. Indeed, only accolades and ooohs and ahhhs could be heard between bites. Or maybe I should say sips? The drinks are outstanding! I had a pomegranate coconut concoction that was to die for, and their margaritas are made with only the finest ingredients, with a flourish of chili pepper on the rim if spicy is your thing. I don't normally order chicken when dining out but decided on chicken with mole sauce which was divine! The sauce was quite simply, perfect. Ceviche was amazing and the tre leche arguably the best I've ever experienced, as was everything else we ordered. You can't go wrong here folks. If you enjoy authentic Mexican food run, don't walk to this fabulous restaurant which has surely earned its Michelin star.Well done!"
5250,"Okay I hate to be this B but HOW DOES THIS PLACE HAVE A MICHELIN STAR???? whew, okay, sorry had to get that off my chest. So I came here last night for dinner and the place was BUSY. We waited half an hour in line and got seated outside. Our servers were super nice and attentive so the stars given are for them. We ordered the sopecitos, ceviche, cochininito, mole plate, and the tres leches.The only thing out of all these I can say was really good was the ceviche. The rest sort of just got gradually worse as the dishes came out. The ceviche was fresh the the chips were crisp. The sopecitos tasted mostly like lettuce and sour cream- I feel like chorizo usually is so pungent and theirs just wasn't. It was also so damn mushy. Maybe I just like my chorizo a little more crisped than most people but this didn't do anything for me. We got our main dishes and the rice tasted like it was out of a zatarains box and the mole just tasted like a sort of bland sweet sauce which I feel like you have to TRY to make mole bland. The Cochinita had way too much vinegar. I just spent two months in the Yucatán and ate more of these same dishes than I care to admit and they just really missed the mark. Finally, the tres leches. Et tu, tres leches!? We are two people that not only have a huge sweet tooth but love this type of cake. We couldn't even get through half. It tasted (I'm assuming) and sort of looked like when cardboard gets really wet and becomes that thick mushy nonsense and then someone added condensed milk. It was worse than my local Mexican tiendas prepackaged cake. Maybe I'm too spoiled with Mexican food in LA and the Mexican food in, well, Mexico but holy moly why did I spend 200 dollars on this. I want my money and 2 hours back"
5251,Absolutely delicious! Limited vegetarian options but everything was fantastic! Only downside is the inability to reserve
5252,"Cuisine: 7Service: 6Decor: 7Value: 4Overall: 6Not sure what I think about this long time Mexican staple in the LIC area. One Michelin Star again in 2021? It's not bad, but how do you compare the quality to other one star peers like Gramercy Tavern, L'Appart, or River Cafe?To be completely honest, I have not been back here in over 5-6 years, simply because I can get better quality Mexican food that's more authentic for a fraction of the price. Case in point, dinner and a few drinks for three of us was $300. For Mexican food? Come on! Feel like I'm paying more for that Michelin star rather than unbelievable Mexican food.With that said, most of the food and drinks were good. I enjoy all the apps like Guacamole ($16), Fried Oysters ($21) and Crab Tostadas ($21), being washed down with a Coco Mojito ($14). Manhattan prices? Yup!Entrees were a bit more disappointing. The Skirt Steak actually tasty, but the portions should be so much bigger than what we got. However, the Chile Relleno sauce was way goo sweet, and the Lamb Shank could have used a different sauce altogether. Btw, they were all overpriced in my opinion.The restaurant looks nice, and the outdoor seating is set up nicely. However, the service on this day was a tad slow and lackadaisical. For the amount we paid, I would have expected Michelin quality service as well. Not sure how Casa Enrique keeps receiving a Michelin star when other great restaurants don't. I won't be giving them any more of my money going forward."
5253,"Came here on a Thursday evening for dinner, walked in with a party of 2 and were seated immediately, after vaccine card check. We were told the drinks specials and ordered the pineapple basil margarita which was SO GOOD. Everything balanced, just the right amount of alcohol, highly recommend.For our appetiser, we got spicy guacamole which left my mouth tingling. There are three salsas given on entry and those went great with the guac and chips as well as with our tacos. For our mains we ordered 3 sets of tacos (each order comes with a pair of tacos). I got the brisket (suadero) which was lovely, melt in your mouth and buttery, but I wish there were more things in the taco other than 1 pickled slice of carrot and radish and a smattering of onions and a leaf, maybe some guac or tomatoes? My friend got the fish (pescado) which she enjoyed. We then split the vegan tacos, which were great! I don't like vegetables masquerading as meat but these mushrooms were celebrated in their own right. Finally for dessert, my friend got the tres leches, which she loved, and I got the chocolate pot a creme, which I felt was super rich so i packed it to eat later. Our server was very attentive and nice. Overall would recommend!!"
5254,"Was excited to try this Michelin star rated Mexican restaurant for dinner! We had reservations so we were seated right away. Appealing ambiance and simple decorations -- white walls, tables, and chairs. Dim lighting in the evening. Every table is separated with clear dividers.De Pollo Con Mole De Piaxtla Enchiladas ($21) - one of their specialities- chicken breast rolled in corn tortilla doused mole sauce -- also included red onion, black beans, crema fresca, queso fresco and avocado- sauce made it sweet and nutty- Tasted okay but chicken was overcooked/dry- heavyPastel Trees Leches ($9)- Another one of their specialities- Sponge cake made of 3 kinds of milk, goat milk, and caramel drizzle- Spongy, buttery, and really sweet because the cake is super saturated with condensed milkTaste 3.5/5Service 5/5"
5255,"The atmosphere is bland and you probably wouldn't even know it was a Mexican place if you just walked in without knowing the name of the restaurant. Just plain white walls, little art or anything interesting. The food is decent. The mole enchiladas and the guacamole were both good but did not at all have the wow factor you would expect from the only Michelin starred restaurant in Queens. If you want solid Mexican food in Queens, make your way over to Viva Viva Taqueria in Astoria."
5256,"Somehow on a rainy Saturday morning we got a walk-in table for 5! Couldn't believe our luck. We opted for a boozy, delicious brunch, and Casa Enrique did not disappoint on food or drink.We started with some guacamole and tacos. The chips were surprisingly good and the salsas and guac were top notch. Out of the tacos, our favorite was the al pastor, but the lengua and brisket were also tasty. For me, the highlight was definitely the mole. I could've drank an entire bowl of it. It was amazing on the enchiladas and huevos, but our preference was actually for the huevos.Drinks wise, you can't go wrong. However, their special cocktails were especially memorable. The mango mojito and pineapple margarita were stand outs. Service was fast and friendly and we had a great time. Their outdoor dining space in front of the restaurant was lovely and provided a peaceful shelter from the spring rain."
5257,"Love the food here, so creative using local flavors from his home land. Recommend for a nice lunch and sharing in a group to try different dishes"
5258,"Almost two years since my first visit, Casa Enrique is even better than I remembered!They no longer take reservations (hopefully just temporary) and you must wait in line (no leaving your name!) so come close to 5pm if possible. I arrived around 5:30pm and had to wait about 5-10 minutes before getting seated, but the line got a lot longer by the time we left.Of course, I HAD to order the Mole de Piaxtla again. The flavor of the sauce is truly unique and so addicting. It's nutty and rich and creamy and chocolatey yet just lightly sweet and balanced and *insert allll the adjectives here.* It's the kind of tasty where your arms gotta flap to let out the expressive energy.The other two new dishes we ordered today were the crab tostadas and the lamb shank (Chamorro de Borrego). The crab dish was a refreshing appetizer but the real winner was the lamb. Ohhh my goodness. It reminded me of my favorite childhood dish - a Chinese spicy tomato-based beef noodle soup. Perhaps there were spices in common in the sauce, or perhaps it was just so good that it brought back childhood associations like that grumpy food critic in Ratatouille. Either way, the lamb shank became our second MUST ORDER. (It also came with beans and rice on the side, and the beans were lowkey a winner too.)And of course, we finished off with some flan and had plenty of leftovers to take home.Casa Enrique, I wish there weren't a body of water separating us! It is an absolute must visit - I'm looking at you, fellow Manhattanites."
5259,"They don't take reservations but we stopped by on a Tuesday night around 8 and didn't have any problems getting a table. We ordered the guacamole, sopecitos de chorizo, and tacos al pastor as well as tacos de carne asada. The tacos were amazing, flavors were spot on and the meats were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The sopecitos were also tasty but I just wish they were bigger. The only thing was a bit disappointing, especially coming from a Mexican restaurant was the guacamole. They don't use cilantro so it almost tasted a bit bland. For dessert they only have flan and tres leches cake, both pretty traditional and left me wishing for something more innovative or versatile. We tried the cake and it was fine, good but nothing out of this world. Nevertheless this is a solid spot for a laid back dinner."
5260,"Amazing, everything I had here was delicious, I ordered for takeout and it was also packaged very well, they Saran wrapped all the containers to prevent from spilling.The winner was the rasa Rajas Con Crema, with fresh corn tortilla, the second best was the Enchiladas De Pollo En Salsa Verde. I also got Cochinita Chiapaneco dish but the meat was not as tender as I hoped. The sauce was flavorful though. I look forward to eating this in house one day."
5261,"I have mixed reviews about the food. I went with a group so we ordered guacamole and the ceviche de pescado for appetizers. Both of the appetizers were tasty. For entrees, we got the carne asada, tacos de carne asada, and mole de piaxtla. The tacos were very basic tacos and nothing special. The carne asada was good but the mole de piaxtla wasn't exactly for my flavor palette. There was too much of a cinnamon kick. We didn't order drinks, but the drinks did look very aesthetic and unique. I might've also rated this place a bit higher, but our service was quite slow and they don't have a waitlist nor take reservations so we had to wait on a long line to be seated."
5262,"There was a major hold up in the kitchen when I dined here on Sunday 5 pm, but damn, the food was so good that whatever hanger that had been slowly rising in me went away.It took 45 minutes for the first appetizers to come out. I had the beet and jicama salad, the sopecitos de chorizo, and the crab tostadas. The beet and jicama salad was crisp, evenly julienned, and a refreshing joy to eat. It's a good salad but entirely skippable. The tortilla in the sopecitos de chorizo was so fluffy and thick, it felt like the chorizo on top of it was merely the medium to delivery delicious corn tortilla into my mouth. The crab tostada was fresh and crisp and good, but I didn't find the flavors mindblowing.Not nearly as mindblowing as the mole was. (And FYI, the entrees arrived about 20 minutes after the appetizers, which felt excruciatingly long since the appetizers had whet my appetite.) You can get their signature mole over an enchilada or over chicken and rice, and I did the latter. And rice is indeed the perfect medium to sop up all of that dark, smoky, sweet, spicy mole complexity. The dark chicken meat was perfectly tender, of course. The lamb shank also arrives in an impressively large hunk, doused in a red sauce. The meat is similarly fork-tender, and if you are daring enough, try to dig out for bone marrow in the shank.As a watcher of carbs, I never thought I'd ask for extra orders of rice, beans, and tortillas - but I did. The rice was fluffy and separated, the beans added moistness and savoriness to whatever bite you constructed, and the tortillas came warmed in a little covered pan.The meal wouldn't have been complete without the tres leches cake. It's long on the rum, which I'm not complaining about.To my delight, our server comped dessert due to the long wait."
5263,"We came here at 5pm when it just opened and it was already packed within minutes. Luckily we were able to grab a good seat indoors. We ordered the Rajas Con Crema, Suadero, tacos de pescado, and flan. It was definitely very filling. Price wise was a bit more expensive than other spots but the food presentation makes up for it."
5264,"That Michelin Star is well deserved. Fantastic food - guacamole, chips, jicama salad, mole items, flan, you name it. Great, balanced tequila- and mezcal-based cocktails. Also very good, attentive service. Not over-priced.The place is immaculately clean. They have an air purifier in their basement for the staff, even! Outdoor seating is great, indoors they placed plastic dividers between tables (in addition to requiring vaccination, of course). The past couple of months they do seem to be closed on the odd day, so I'd call to make sure their open before going - also no reservations are taken, I believe. Enjoy!"
5265,"Stumbled upon this place while looking for a restaurant to meet with friends on google, and it was a good find! There is plenty of outdoor seating, and the fans at each table really made the difference in the summer heat. Our server was attentive and knew the menu well. The drinks are great, and the guacamole was excellent. The food here is really outstanding. I had the vegan tacos, which may have been some of the best veg tacos I have ever had. They are mushroom based, and full of flavor. If you are in the area, I would definitely recommend coming here. At 5:45 on a Friday night, there was a 1 hr wait for inside, but we were seated outside immediately."
5266,5/5 for the actual food. 3/5 for the waaaaaait omgggg. It is like a club line just to get inside. $20-30 per plate is expected here for the quality of the food. The mole with chicken was really good and different - cinnamon-y! Steak was super good too. Came here for a friends bday.
5267,"Casa Enrique is a restaurant that lives up to expectations but doesn't necessarily exceed them. I had a wonderful meal but it was pricey!I came to Casa Enrique tonight with a colleague after reading about the restaurant for years. I collected recommendations from friends and Yelp and lined up with other patrons at 5pm. The restaurant seemed to get busy at 6-6:30pm.We ordered:Watermelon margaritasGuacamoleCrab tostada (was provided complementary due to ceviche delays)CevicheFish tacosLamb shankThe lamb shank was the star of the show! It was so soft and juicy - it fell right off the bone. It was served with corn tortillas, black beans, and rice. The portion was very large. This should be shared with a friend.I found the guacamole and ceviche to be good but to me, they were not the legendary items I had read about. The crab tostada was delicious too with a nice amount of lime. The fish tacos were tasty too. We were too full for dessert, so we'll have to try the tres leches cake next time. The meal came out to $150 after tax and tip. $75pp seems a bit steep - each item was definitely pricey.I understand that one Michelin star connotes a very good restaurant in its category. I'm just not sure that Casa Enrique is as special as other starred restaurants I have frequented. That being said, I would go back again in the future but I would not rush to return."
5268,"Thought I'd take a walk down memory lane and see how the dishes I fell in love with over half a decade ago are holding up.  Times are tough, but Casa Enrique is still managing to execute tremendous main dishes.  However, I feel some sides have declined in their excellence. One should always start with the most important thing: dessert.  The Pastel Tres Leches still stands apart as a unique take on (while truly honoring) the traditional dish.Moving on to apps, their Rajas con Crema remains the single best version of the dish I have yet to try.  Their De Pollo con Mole de Piaxtla Enchiladas are very good.  The mole starts off deceivingly sweet, then the bitter from the chocolate layers in, then the heat.  They really knock this dish out of the park.  Chamorro de Borrego al Huaxamole (lamb shank) is still out of this world, and easily makes for two meals.  The small portion of rice and black beans served leaves the dish slightly imbalanced.  However, not a loss on the evening I ordered (which could fairly have been an off night) since both sides were surprisingly bland.All in all, Case Enrique is still executing on a great level and well worth considering next time you want to treat yourself to a Michelin Star experience."
5269,"I've been looking forward to trying out Casa Enrique for some months, from it's Michelin accolades to bring in the Infatuation greatest hits list. I was pleasantly surprised to find no wait for a table for 2 at 1pm Sunday for brunch. We proceeded to order guac for the table and dove right into chicken tacos and the Mexican scrambled eggs entree. The food was all delicious and we couldn't help but overstuff ourselves so much so that we were sorry not to have room for their desserts. Looking forward to next time to fix that."
5270,"Marvelous Place  While we were walking looking  for a place to have an appetizer and a couple of drinks, we passed by this place and decided to give it a try. Wonderful choose, this place is cozy , charm and elegant.  The service is wonderful and fast, a very important quality for one hour lunch. We ordered acai bowls to eat and for drinks we ordered a couple to try.DrinksMimosa - Always good Sparkling prosecco - Very goodSangria- Homemade ! it was superbBellini - 5 of 5 !  Wonderful Taste !The place is small but very unique vibe , cozy and warm.  I will definitely come back !"
5271,"The Sandwich Matin, listed as one of their classics on the menu, was more about the bread than the fillings. So I applaud the brioche but the gruyere was less prominent than I hoped. The price tag of the smallish orange juice is by no means an outlier at $4.75, as the average diner probably charges more than a 64-ounce grocery container, but I found less sweet and more grapefruit-y than expected. I wouldn't be surprised is the coffee is first-rate, based on a brief glance of the indoor tables."
5272,"During the summer, we visited La Parisienne in Financial District for brunch. It was easy to find, as it was very popular, and saw many people dining or waiting for a table.They had tempting looking baked goods on the counter. We got Almond Croissant, Financier, and Canelé. Almond Croissant was tall and buttery. As for Financier, I thought it was a Madeleine...therefore, it was surprising to get the full almond flavor. It was not as soft as I wanted, but moist and sweet. Canelé had kind of tough exterior, which was unexpected. Blast of caramel flavor.With that much baked goods, we didn't feel the need to order two separate brunch dishes, so we ordered Croque Madam to share. We added a side of mixed greens.Croque Madam was cheesy goodness. The ham was thicker than some other ones we had, nice and meaty! The egg was cooked just right. It was filling and satisfying.Since it was such a nice brunch, we thought why not end it with some coffee and dessert? So, we ordered Cappuccino and Paris-Brest. The size of Paris-Brest was much bigger than expected, which was great. It had loads of cream filling! The cream was more solid than ""cream"" which made it easier to cut and eat. It was an excellent dessert!We had a nice, relaxing brunch here. The staff never rushed us, even though it was a popular spot. We enjoyed everything we ordered, and we were happy and full. Definitely a place we want to go back to in a future."
5273,"This is a nice little cafe with a unique menu.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype for me.  Read on for more details.The turmeric latte was super watered down. Tasted lik water and turmeric. No other flavor or milk. The cappuccino also tasted watered down.  Couldn't really taste any espresso. The forestier croque was an interesting dish. Some may like it, but I found it to be extremely greasy and oily. The avocado toast with egg was the only decent item we ordered.  There was just the right amount of avocado, the egg was poached just right, and the flavors came together great.  Would come back just to order this."
5274,"I can't get over how delicious the food is here. There's a reason why there's always a line, but it's well worth the wait. My boyfriend and I came here for brunch on our anniversary. I got a salmon brioche breakfast and he got a French toast. Yum to all the bread baked here. The egg yolk was perfect, not so runny that your hands get sticky but runny enough that you get that beautiful texture as you eat it. Smoked salmon was delicious and the fresh dill really brightened it up. The French toast was warm, had fresh fruit, and was doused in syrup, which I was worried about at first but it actually wasn't too sweet, which was a pleasant surprise ^^.Latte and wine were both excellent as well. We sat outdoors in the fall but the internal decor is charming, too.I highly recommend this place!"
5275,"Really good food and energy in the establishment, but the food is a tad pricey. Would come again! I liked their coffee hehe."
5276,"A Parisian cafe right in the heart of Wall Street district. Cool enough of an idea for us to wait in the freezing cold with two kiddies to take a peek. I'm glad we did! (Tip: Use Yelp to ""wait in line"").. but, we did receive a 10% off code for checking in, so I didn't feel too bad.Anyways, REALLY tiny place, but they were able to comfortably fit all 4 of us and our bags in (we were coming from our stay at the Marriott directly across the street). But, so quaint.. if I were a local, I'd make this my weekend spot to sip cafe with a croissant with my morning paper? No, some sort of romantic novel? Anyways.. Tonya was our server and she was nice and attentive. I ordered a much needed bellini.. to go with a VERY delicious and indulgent Sandwich Matin that came on a brioche bun with avocado, runny egg, proscuitto. HIGHLY recommended. My daughter demolished her French toast. They didn't care for their hot chocolates much.. probably not as sweet for 9 year old palates. We took chocolate croissants to go and though I haven't had much to compare it to, it was tasty enough.Nice experience!"
5277,"The best french toast I've ever had. It comes in 2 sizes - single for $10 and 2 pieces for $18. The toast is one of their signature dishes, served in an unconventional way - the bread is circular and puffy as opposed to the typical square/rectangular shape. It's made perfectly with a soft texture and the single serving is a good amount for a light - medium light breakfast. The one thing I would change next time is I'd ask for syrup on the side since I felt there was a little bit too much syrup poured on the toast.The plain croissant was not too special and the orange juice was good. The cafe itself has a small interior with a few tables (mostly for 2) and some bar seating. The bar seating is nice because you get to see how they prepare the dishes! If you come at peak brunch hours (10-12ish) you can expect a wait. Excited to visit again sometime!"
5278,"I celebrated my birthday with friends at La Parisienne Cafe downtown. Little French gem in the middle of Financial District. The place seemed very popular, and even though we had no reservations, we had a great experience. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The Cappuccino was delicious, the food as well. I had a Croque madame. It was terrific ."
5279,"This place has a beautiful and soft ambiance when you enter, and were seated indoors. The food was pretty good but definitely could have been more for the price paid- I ended up ordering a chia pudding bowl in addition to the main breakfast because I was hungry! Would recommend though:)"
5280,"Decent food but incredibly expensive. The portions are super small. I feel like I could only come here for a snack. My sandwich came really cold. The French toast was the best but so small. Avocado toast was pretty good. The chocolate croissant was ok but the almond one was good. Ambience is super cute and homey. I'm not sure id come again for the price. If it was cheaper, I would."
5281,Nice little eatery in the Financial district.  Grabbed a few lattes and some croissants on the way to One World Observatory.  The servers here were friendly and accommodating.  The ham and cheese croissant was very tasty.  Highly recommend!
5282,"I went here sort of on a whim and every since I cannot stop thinking about it. The food is amazing and really excites the pallet. Everything from the light salads and fruits to the hearty and rich sandwich was just *chef's kiss*. The latte that I had was delicious and creamy and I really enjoyed being able to watch them make it! But the best part? It wasn't the decor, although it was extremely cute and chic. It wasn't the size, but it's definitely a cozy spot great for a first date (or anniversary!). No, the best part of my entire experience was the staff. Everyone, from the greeter and waitress to the chef and barista, were absolutely amazing. The main chef was a woman who was very much like my own mother; a strong woman who knew how to lead. I had the absolute privilege of talking to her (in Spanish! It was so great to talk with another Latino) and it honestly made my entire week. The care and love that the staff put into this place was evident from speaking to her and her co-workers really set this place apart for me. I really cannot wait to go back. This place is a must!"
5283,"Dropped in for a late lunch around 2pm on a Thursday - the place is really small (cosy?) and there were only a few tables available at the time, but fortunately we were seated immediately. It's a cute space with some quirky decor, although my seat was rather uncomfortable - a bench-like row along the wall with too many pillows/cushions.For my meal I ordered a croque madame with a side of mixed greens. Croque madame was delicious - perfectly-toasted bread; gooey, flavourful gruyère; with just the right amount of béchamel complementing the rich ham. Egg on top was a nice touch, although I ended up eating it separately from the rest of the sandwich so I'm not sure if it was worth :PI actually don't usually order salads when eating out since I think it's usually not a great value, but I was really pleasantly surprised at both the quality and quantity of the side salad - fresh veggies tossed with a nice, clean dressing paired very well with the more savoury sandwich. I also ordered a glass of orange juice - not sure if I'd order again, as it was pretty expensive for its size, but it definitely was very fresh (as advertised) with just the right balance of sweetness and tartness.Anyway, overall very great value for its price, especially given both the quality of the food and the location. The menu has a lot of other yummy brunch-esque options, so I hope to be back soon to try them out!"
5284,"My daughter and I came here for lunch the other day after reading other Yelp reviews. The restaurant is a little small and, although there is outside seating along the sidewalk, it is located in a very noisy area so sitting inside was a more attractive option for us.  My first impression was that it is a cute place but the floors/baseboards could use some cleaning. Our server was kind and very attentive even though he seemed to be the only one working that day.My daughter ordered the Gaspacho and thought it was very tasty, and she also had the Salmon Brioche, which she thought was a little dry. I ordered the Croque Salmon which was surprisingly a bit bland for my tastes. I was thinking how much better it would have tasted had the tiny pieces of zucchini been some kind of pickle, instead."
5285,My mom was visiting in town and wanted to go to a French Cafe for breakfast one day. We were so happy with our experience at La Parisienne and mom was beaming the whole time. I had French toast and she had a ham and cheese croissant and it was all so good.
5286,La Parisienne was the first spot we dined at after checking into our hotel. Hands down the best spot we dined at for breakfast and brunch.*Iced Vanilla Latte with Oat Milk: Best iced latte I had in NYC! It was love at first sip which resulted in walking here every morning to grab a cup to go. I highly recommend it!*Plain Croissant & Pain au chocolat: Both were so fluffy and fresh!*Croque Monsieur: One of the best croques I've had since my Paris trip. The bechamel was so smooth and tucked in the sandwich instead of being smothered on top. I also loved the toasted sourdough bread it gave it a nice tangy twist. The hubby tried a bite and knew that this was my kind of croque. We ordered this again on our last day prior to heading to the airport. It traveled well.*Warm Goat Cheese Salad: anything with goat cheese is a winner with the hubby. He raved about his salad. We came here 3 times for food and also ordered coffee to-go on the other days. The food and drinks were always consistent.Customer service was top notch. Our server checked up on us frequently and even provided us with a complimentary pastry as we waited for our food due to issues in the kitchen. We even chatted with the owner who was super sweet and told us about her restaurant. I wish her nothing but the best as I cannot wait to stop by again when come back to NYC. Cheers!
5287,"The perfect spot to grab lunch. My husband and I were visiting the 9-11 memorial and came here for lunch afterwards. Such a cute European feel inside, and a delicious variety of foods and drinks. The sandwiches were delicious and we loved the croissant we had. Definitely recommend for a delicious lunch near the World Trade Center"
5288,"This is a cute little café right in the Financial District. I first found this place by using the Ritual app. They had a promotion for $1 iced coffees for the week. It was later in the day and La Parisienne was the closest location in my area. I followed Google Maps down Maiden Lane and ran into a waiter wearing a shirt with the name of the restaurant.I was immediately intrigued as I entered this place. It feels as if you are transported back to France with the small café interior with the French music playing in the background. My friend loved the outdoor signage of the girl eating chocolate and the imitation grass by the outdoor tables. They have several tables available for indoor and outdoor seating. There was a long line of people waiting for tables so we were not able to get a seat. Luckily, I was only ordering an iced espresso so it was not too much of a hassle.La Parisienne is one of those places that you probably would not notice unless you were specifically guided here. I worked here for the last couple of years and never noticed this side corner with several restaurants and stores. In that case thanks to the Ritual app for helping me find this place. I was not able to get a full meal here this time but I will be back again."
5289,"I've been here a couple times in the recent past and was always satisfied with my experience. Whether you're looking for dessert, a Cappuccino, quick bite, full meal or drinks, La Parisienne will transport you to feeling as though you're in a Paris Cafe. The interior is small but quaint. Round tables were available for outdoor seating and with the weather being so mild we did just that for a quick catch up drink.Service was good and I enjoyed my Aperol Spritz since it was well made. Not all are created equally  since it depends on the quality of Prosecco used.La Parisienne is a good place to consider if you want a low key, quiet and cute atmosphere with your meal."
5290,"TLDR: really cute spot for some healthier options in the city La Parisienne is a small little haven in the big city. They've got a good mix of outdoor and indoor seating. I got a table outdoors (note they are small but they fit everything that you need).Their menu has a good selection of drinks and healthier food options. I opted for a grapefruit juice which is freshly squeezed (you can taste bits of the pulp) and the warm green bowl, which was satisfying and healthy. All in all had a good experience here!"
5291,Wow oh wow. The French toast is my new fav French toast ever. I had never had brioche French toast before and it was the perfect amount of fluffiness and sweetness and the almonds was such a nice touch. The matin sandwich was good also and a nice light breakfast sandwich and the brioche bun was nice a fluffy. Overall highly recommend this place in the financial district. Such cute vibes also. It's a small place that fits mostly couples (1-2 people). Larger groups can be difficult
5292,"I live around the neighborhood and have been here a few times. It's a cute, quaint, little French style restaurant. I love sitting at the bar/counter area. You can come here alone or with friends. I've had the salads, salmon brioche, toast, matcha, coffee, latte here and they're all very good. Can't go wrong with any of the food. I'd love to try the French toast the next time I'm back. I love how they have non dairy options as well! I had the latte and salmon brioche today and the latte with oat milk and it was made perfectly, wouldn't change anything. The service is always great and I appreciate the staff. They're always busy, the place is SO popular. There's always a line long or short outside because everyone wants to come eat here! Such a cute instagrammable restaurant!"
5293,Amazing food and great service the place is small  very busy always but very French.  I went here for breakfast twice and food was excellent.  The portions are French but quality is great!
5294,Yelp wait list made seating so easy. I walked over and only waited 5 extra minutes. Was seated inside easily. Proof of vaccine required. Comfy seating inside. Food is fresh amd delicious. Enjoyed my dining experience and would return again. Cappuccino was so good. Eggplant sandwich was yummy. Will return when in the area again.t
5295,"This cafe is one of those places that transports you to another place even if you've never been to this place before. I've never been to France before but I feel like I've been given a little taste of it here. Of course, the decor is super cute and on top of that, the food (specifically, the Croque Forestier) is delicious! If you are a big mushroom fan, I highly recommend ordering this. The staff is also very friendly. I can't wait to come back and try their other sandwiches and drinks, just grateful its super close to work."
5296,"Been coming here since I started working in NYC and their Croque Madame never disappoints!Perfect place to come treat yourself to a nice breakfast when Starbucks and Dunkin get old, and you just want to chill back to listen to some nice Parisian music while eatingAlso, LOVE their coffees! This is a mocha in the pics, delicious! Not too sweet either"
5297,"Met a friend here for a ""quick"" brunch.  Thankfully we came here during a very off hour and so we didn't have to wait too long to get seated.  It was a very impromptu meet-up, and I didn't have too much time but wanted to catch up before she went out of town.  Thankfully she chose this spot which was only a 15min walk from where I live in BP.  I didn't get anything fancy, just a coffee and a croissant.  I feel like even the simplest things can really tell how well a place is.  Service was really good, I never really had to wait long for anything included the check.  It was clean, and we didn't have to wait for our order either.  (To note, I HAVE seen the line down the street, esp on weekends, during the brunch hour.)Croissant:PROS- very crispy outside, and soft inside.  Well baked.- came out slightly warm (I had asked to warm it a bit)- not stale, def felt fresh but I could be mistaken, not sure if they bake on premise)CONS- none, a nice standard croissant.Coffee:PROS:- generous portions- not diluted (like some Asian cafes)- not too strong (where it was stale and sitting on a hot plate or a warmer for a long period of time)CONS:- it isn't gourmet but depends on what you're going for.I can't say that this place WOW'd me so much that I would go back.  This is especially if there is a line and there are no reservations allowed (understandably of course because the place is SMALL).  I was in such a hurry that I forgot to take a picture of my croissant.  But as I read in another review, I will highly contemplate placing a to-go order."
5298,"La Parisienne is an adorable cafe with amazing food. I love their croissants and pain au chocolat for a quick breakfast, and my go to for lunch are the Mediterranean Quinoa Bowl or the Avocado Toast. Both outstanding. it is a rare gem in our neighborhood."
5299,"The French toast, mocha and service was excellent. I enjoyed the music and the bathroom is clean. I'll be back for sure."
5300,"Came by for breakfast as our hotel was nearby! Such a good call. The coffee was DELICIOUS, albeit a little expensive as we asked for a splash of oat milk and instead got charged for a full bell pitcher of it each. For food, we got the Salmon Brioche, Avocado Toast, and a bowl of fresh fruit. The brioche was incredibly fresh and fluffy, the spread and the salmon was delicious, and it was such a great combo overall. The avocado toast was also SO delicious! Fruits were fresh and sweet, but everything was just a bit overpriced which was unfortunate.Loved it here! Seriously, come try the coffee here."
5301,"I am leaning towards a 4 because of the great food, but honestly we are a little disappointed with the seating though there were overhead heaters. There is no real outdoor dining space and you're sitting directly on the sidewalk meaning pedestrians walk by your table all the time so it made us feel unsafe. Also the tent that covered the spot had collected water and it spilled directly onto where I was sitting.Otherwise we really enjoyed the croque madame and monsieur. The homemade French toast was very good, the top was crispy and inside had like a custard texture. Only drawback was the food got cold really quickly and so did my cappuccino. I would try to come back when indoor dining is available again for a better experience."
5302,Delicious avocado toast. Good service and friendly wait staff.  Tiny French style restaurant.
5303,"I reviewed this place 2 years ago when I was staying at a hotel nearby. Now, I live a block away! It's my favorite cafe in the area. Always good, and so cute."
5304,Very small place and there's a wait but for a good reason.  Food is outstanding and portions are huge.   Service was good.  There was a wait but we'll worth it.
5305,"We were there on the cold winter weekend afternoon since my husband craved for French cuisine. It was a lovely place but tiny. The drinks were fantastic, it were exactly what we needed for a shivering afternoon. Hot chocolate was smoother than my skin after a spa day.Food was tasty. We ordered what other people had on their table because we all knew the decision process, from screening through the menu to deciding on what to order, took the longest time for a brunch date. Service is decent. We only had one teeny tiny complaint was that our table were right by the door, it was chilly when people opened the door and kept bumping into your our seats.Overall, it was worth a visit!"
5306,"What a place  most likely there will be a wait, but this place feels like time travel, once you sit down you get carried away to a morning in France with chatter, nice music, calm lighting, forgetting your agenda for the day and enjoying a taste of france with your cappuccino."
5307,"Wonderful atmosphere, very cozy and local cafe great for brunch with a couple friends. We ordered the French toast and breakfast sandwich Matin which were both delicious. The French toast was steeped in just the right amount of sweetness from the syrup and cream and melts in your mouth along with the blueberries and bananas. The ingredients seem fresh and would definitely come again!"
5308,Not joke the BEST almond croissant I have ever had in my life. The Almond Milk latte was great too and was served in a large mug. Love the aesthetic/vibe of this place and the servers were so sweet and attentive. I work nearby now and will definitely be back!!
5309,"This is located in an area that parking is nearly impossible... so do not drive to come over here. The place is cute and it has a lot of character, the decor is pretty nice and the staff is friendly. The prices here are not cheap so be ready to sped a good amount of money in a very simple kind of meal time here, however it is pretty place to take someone to have a lunch date. They have mimosas and belinis and that is what I went for when I came over. Due to the COVID they have some outside sitting by the sidewalk, but I am not sure if that will be something permanent once things get back to normal, however they do have some sitting inside, they also have a bakery style service so you can go in grab and go. They are a French spot so they have a lot of French meals and sandwiches to pick from. BURRATA SALAD- we got a burrata and tomato salad and it comes with a side of bread, and this was a pretty good appetiser, the price was pretty spicy but it tasted amazing and we shared amongst 3 of us. I was pretty happy with it and I liked it a lot. the cheese was nice and fresh, the tomatoes as well san the sprouts and the balsamic made a lot of difference on the taste. CROQUETE MADAME- this was a huge let down for me. I usually have this plate at any place it is available so I dint not think twice to oder it once I saw it. however the biggest reason why I get this for the béchamel sauce that generally if on top of the sandwich and it is a sauce that I truly love and appreciate, however when I saw my order I could not spot where the béchamel was.... it looks like they either did not put any on it or if the did, they just spread it on the bread, which as I said it was a huge let down, I love plenty of béchamel on my croquet and this one did not do it for me.... also the fact that it was so expensive this was over 15 dollars to have not a drop of sauce anywhere to be found got me real disappointed. specially being a French restaurant I had expectations on their béchamel that I feel like I did not even taste on the sandwich. Overall we had a great time and the drink were good, but the fact that their croquet does not align with my taste I would probably not come back here to spend the amount of money I did to be disappointed again.I wold not say I do not recommend the place as I did not like it because of personal taste, but I would not recommend the croquet madame to anyone specially if they are like me and love their béchamel.MY REPLY TO BUSINESS COMMENT: I just wanna address how the business said I waited a few weeks to complaint about it...  I by no means said that their food is bad. I said that every other croquet madame I have ever had has always come with bechamel sauce at top of the sandwich. And by me telling them or asking them to put it on top of my sandwich would not necessarily mean that every customer would get the same meal. Making my review misleading if I posted a croquet madame with sauce on my review when everyone else would not get the same.... so the issue would not be resolved if I asked for the sauce. My review is based on the meal as the restaurant serve it, as it is not my place to modify their meals to fit my narrative and make misleading reviews as modifications are not the rule of the menu and won't be the same experience every other customerwill have. If their style of croquet madame is different from other stablishments it is their right to make those modifications. What is not right is to imply that a customer should have approached them to ask for something and imply that this review is a complaint and shift the blame at me when all I am doing is give my opinion on my experience... but anyways as I said, their style was different and not something I would come back to. If you guys try it let me know what u had and how u liked it."
5310,"The food was pleasant. Very small and quaint little spot. We had a party of 8. When we arrived the store was about 80% full. Was told our wait would be about 10 mins. After about 45 mins and many others parties of 2 seated bf us, we felt ignored. They didn't seat us until we complained and that didn't feel right. Professionalism in the service industry goes a long way and really matters to customers. Please reconsider how you approach these situations and take accounts of customers personal experiences with your business."
5311,"This is such a cute café. It's a neighborhood gem. Excellent coffee, fresh authentic French pastries and great breakfast sandwiches. I love the vibe and some of the French grocery items for sale. I have not had their lunch sandwiches but they look very fresh and tasty.."
5312,Excellent sandwich. I had the sandwich matin and it was a great sandwich. The flavor was great and bun also amazing but I did think the bun was a bit too big compared to the other parts of the sandwich. I also had the almond croissant which was just alright and tasted like an ordinary almond croissant
5313,"Perfect breakfast/brunch spot. They have cute patio chairs and tables for you to sit outside when its nice out. I got the madame croque and the avocado toast with salmon, it was delicious!"
5314,"Enjoyed it all  great coffee as well and macdalines  service was amazing, thank you. Good gluten free options, nice city view  5 stars all around"
5315,"The staff was very kind, the food was delicious. We ordered their French toast and OMG it was fantastic!!"
5316,"Their food was super good and everything that came out, came out with style. Super pretty, but still casual, presentation. We enjoyed our breakfast"
5317,This brunch spot is operating during covid and taking all precautions. The take your temperature and ask for your info incase they need to get ahold of you. The food was good. The service was good and the whole experience was good.
5318,"I'd for sure come back for breakfast, coffee, pastries and chocolate chip cookies! The service was amazing too!"
5319,Best french toast I've ever had! The croque madame was delicious too! Definitely recommend breakfast here!
5320,This restaurant is a staple and always can be depended on good service and good food. Their ropa vieja is outstanding as is their beans and rice as well as the cuban and chicken sandwich. Service is courteous and fast.  Plenty of cocktail options....and almost forgot about their street corn dish. it is 2 corn on the cob cut into 4 pieces. PACKED with toppings. The best part is the corn kernel comes off with just a slight tug from the gentle bite so you don't get corn stuck in your teeth!  don't know how they manage this but it was delish. could not gone for a 2nd order but we were in a rush.
5321,"Great food just off Times Square.    Authentic and nicely outfitted inside, plenty of space.  Quality of food is high, has full bar as well..."
5322,We loved everything we tried! Great service and food! We made reservations and were seated quickly on a Saturday evening. Our favorite was the camarones y arroz!
5323,"It was ok. They were able to seat us earlier than out reservations. They had live music which was awesome!! They were so good! I came here for the mofongo but when I asked if they had it they said only what's on the menu. Just a bit confusing because others posted pictures of mofongo. Waitress was a little rude. My son had garlic shrimp with rice. It was ok. I had a mojito, also ok. If you're in a bind I would recommend for the ambiance."
5324,WOW! This place did not disappoint! The food was amazing and the drinks were delicious! Not to mention we had the best customer service from our waitress Melany. She was on point and attended to our every need! This is definitely our new Friday after work spot! Thank you so much for great service and delicious Cuban food!
5325,"Latin music, good, and mojitos! Excellent piece of Cuba in the heart of time square. Loved it. Great service."
5326,"THIS PLACE IS TRULY HORRIFIC. NOTHING IS FRESH. I REPEAT - NOTHING IS FRESH. I was so upset about having to pay $150 for food we all disliked & I never care to pay for amazing food, I'm a foodie and never look at prices when it comes to food... but ew omg this food truly sucked. The tostones, tasted like they were the frozen GOYA packs and heated, the empanadas were not crispy at all and were flavorless.. tasted DAYS old. The ropa vieja was okay, but definitely not the way a ropa vieja should look/taste like. Only good things were the black beans and the maduros & even those are questionable. This restaurant has so much work to do. I literally have no idea how or why this place has such great reviews. I'm PERPLEXED and currently sitting in the fckin toilet with DIARRHEA (yes, because of this food!) as I write this! Ughhhh"
5327,"I'm visiting from the west coast and I wanted to try some Caribbean food, so I stumbled upon this restaurant that is located near Times Square. It was phenomenal. Seating is a little uncomfortable but their food and service is beyond excellent. I ordered 3 empanadas and they were amazing. I also ordered a skirt steak with a side of yellow rice and black beans. You will love it."
5328,"All Abuela's must be so upset with this so called Cuban cuisine.   This food is for people who don't know what real Cuban food tastes like.  With regard to service in a particular location,  my husband and I tried the Edison New Jersey location.  It was 9:30 pm and wasn't too busy.  Our server, Alexandra, although polite, was really not paying too much attention to what she was doing.  My martini was served without olives, and when I asked her, she said she'd bring a few for me.  Which she did not. Then we recvd someone else's appetizer, which we then sent back. When I told her, she said ""I saw it coming back to the kitchen.""  Then I requested the olives again to which she came back with a highball glass FILLED with olives and just slammed it down.  My salad was mediocre.  My tostones were hard.  My husbands Cuban sandwich was dry lacking flavor.  There was no Manager to be found.   I spoke to the server regarding  her attitude and such,  expressing that I understood how it feels to work on your feet all day and that's she's probably tired but what she did was insulting and unnecessary.  She apologized.  We will not return to this location or restaurant.   Do a Google search for authentic Cuban food if you desire.  But please don't waste your money here."
5329,Booked a happy hour for a table of 5 at 4:30pm. They check for vaccination cards & IDs. Be ready! My colleagues and I enjoyed all the foods. I say chicken empanadas and roja vieja empanadas are good! They have happy hour drink deals. A mojito is $5 with additional flavor for a $1. I really enjoyed the ribs & wings combo with yellow rice & beans. It was so good I took the leftovers home. Then I cooked it in a bbq sauce over a pan the next morning and it was still delicious. Service is quick and great. It gets busy in here fast!
5330,"This was a fantastic and perfect Thanksgiving meal(s) fit for royalty!  The salmon was prepared just right and tasted succulent to the palate with every bite.  The different shrimp presentations were DIVINE  /  juicy in how each menu item was prepared and tasted GREAT!  Tostones were fried, remained crisp, and moist without being too hard for consumption all by themselves.We ate the black beans with my personal Jasmine rice and saved Havana Central's rice(s) for all of the sauce(s) from the salmon  /  shrimp(s) meals.  Havana's meals just kept giving until every grain of rice  /  sauce(s) were no longer seen.  It was a food experience worth repeating  -  Happy 2021 Thanksgiving!  It is important to mention the service by Carla and Havana Central's team members should be commended."
5331,"This place takes reservations, but it's also first come first serve. Came here for dinner on a Saturday evening and the service was great. We didn't have a large appetite, so we ordered the Cuban Appetizer Sampler and the Salmón con Mango entree to share.Cuban Appetizer Sampler: This sampler is like a meal! It comes with chicken sofrito empanada, beef picadillo empanada, chicharrones de pollo, masitas, maduros & tostones, and is served with chimichurri. I found the masitas and tostones to be more on the drier side.Salmón con Mango: Omg! This dish was delicious and the flavor combo was just right. It comes with grilled Atlantic salmon finished with mango glaze & salsita, as well as a choice of yellow or white rice, and beans or salad.Coconut Mojito: It was really good. It tasted like piña colada and I ended up getting this drink twice. Cava: They didn't have Prosecco so I got Cava instead. It was cold and refreshing with a drop of cherry."
5332,"The food here was really something amazing and maybe some of the best sangria my fiancé has ever had! We started with the empanadas and ordered the shrimp, ground beef, and the shredded steak which was $1 extra. Unfortunately, we were given the chicken instead of the steak and were still charged the extra $1. It wasn't a huge deal to us and the chicken ended up being my favorite of the three although I would have loved to try the shredded beef. We also got the fried chicken thigh bites which came with a bbq sauce and a hot sauce- these were great! I dipped them in both sauces and it was the perfect balance of sweet and spice! For our entrees, I got the Cuban with rice and beans and the street corn. This was certainly a solid Cuban and I would recommend it. The pork usually makes or breaks this sandwich and it definitely made this one. The beans and rice were probably my favorite part of my meal. They were so perfect. My fiancé got (I don't remember the name of the meal) skirt steak with chimichurri and mango salsa. It was SO good. I kept stealing seconds off his plate. The service was okay, but nothing like we had at other restaurants around the city. The menu stated that gratuity is added to parties of 6 or more; however, she added it to our party of 2. Not a big deal, but I have worked in the restaurant industry for 10 years and I know what it means when servers choose to add gratuity. I never tip less than 25% so she ended up cheating herself by adding the 18%. Other than the two hiccups, this place was one of the highlights of our trip."
5333,"Great food, great drinks the Havana Moscow mule.   great location as well, around the corner from time square"
5334,"Havana Central is a good, solid choice for Cuban - even if it's the middle of Times Square. We both had the grande Vegetarian plate, and the Maduros, yellow rice, elote and salad were so good! Everything was fresh and delicious. We've been there twice before and will return."
5335,Great food and live entertainment / dancing. I like looking up what they have planned ahead of going. They make the best mojitos. The pineapple mojito is my favorite. It's a really great place for birthday celebrations.
5336,"Excellent Cuban food with five star service right in the theater district. I love the mojitos, especially the sugar cane for stirring. The food is always delicious. I love the Cuban sandwich and my wife loves the pernil. Good apps with empanadas and tostones being our favorites."
5337,"Fresh food. Great empanadas. Good grilled chicken on the salad.Ho-hum plantains. Mediocre ""specialty drinks""Very good service. Close walk to the theaters. Slightly older interior. We had lunch before a show. It's not mind-blowing, but it wasn't disappointing. Families and couples were there. Someone had a birthday and the staff sang to them. It's a friendly place. They care about their customers. My advice: grab a few empanadas and a couple drinks. Don't make this your main place for dinner."
5338,We had reservations and was seated less then 5min. They ask for vaccinations card for every guest over 5. The waiter was very nice and explained everything on menu. I order vaca frita which come with green rice and a fried egg(not Cuban). I've order vaca frita from plenty of Cuban restaurant and this is different. The vaca frita was ok( it's edible). My husband order pernil and come with white rice and black beans. Black bean is a staple Cuban dish and had no flavor. The pernil was ok we had better. The place is very commercial can really say the food has Cuban flavor. My Husband is Cuban and we are very familiar with Cuban dishes.
5339,"The bartender was welcoming, drinks perfect and the food was yummy!! This is a must visit restaurant every time I visit NYC!"
5340,"I'm giving this place four stars because the waiter was a doll, but I found the food mediocre and the cleanliness terrible. I'm talking about it being so dirty my shoes stuck to the floor, especially in the bathroom, and the floor in the dining area was littered with debris. There were four of us and we each ordered something different, plus appetizers and desserts (we had the $35 special). Chicken wings were good, Street corn was flavorful and empanadas were dry and probably too filling for an appetizer. I ordered the stuffed peppers and they were bland. They were accompanied by overly salted sides that were practically inedible. None of the entrees were outstanding. As for the desserts, the tre leche was way too sugary, but the flan and churros scored high marks. Not a great experience and wouldn't go back, but I'm giving them four stars because they were opened on a Monday night, had good service and let's face it, everyone is struggling right now. With a little tweaking they may just be able to earn the four stars."
5341,"This restaurant has the worst pernil I've ever tried in my life. The meat was dried and had no flavor, I felt like they just used the leftovers and threw it in a pot with water to give it a ""moist"" and ""soft"" texture. My friend ordered the asopao and it was okay. Disappointed"
5342,Food is fabulous! Best Cuban food I've had since being in Havana.Ropa Vieja is to die for!
5343,"Good place by Time Square for decent Cuban food. Ribs and crispy beef were good. It's definitely an enjoyable quick meal, but nothing out of the ordinary."
5344,Came here 2 times while on a visit to NYC that's how good it was. Drinks are on point and food looked and smelled even better. Music was bumping and we were dancing in our bar stools. Definitely try this place out
5345,Had appetizers and a salad  with a friend here! Service was Pretty good and so was good. Fishbowl cocktails are amazing....
5346,"I came here last night to celebrate a friend getting married and we had such a LIVELY experience. Ivan was our waiter and from the start, he had soooo much energy! He memorized the bride and groom name, and specifically made sure to ask them what they wanted to eat, drink first. He made us alll laugh, danced and truly showed his amazing personality! Now to the food/drinks--I ordered the Vaca Frita and also the ""Amazing"" Margarita. I would say the Margarita wasn't that amazing. I've had muchhhh better elsewhere, but it wasn't horrible either so I drank it. The food though was soooo good. The beans were perfect, the cilantro rice to my surprise was super super yummy and I love the green look. The crispy shredded steak was really great as wellll. Honestly the whole meal was put together really nice and they balanced each other out really well. I will definitely be back again, and make sure I get Ivan as my waiter!"
5347,Came from LA to celebrate my wife's  bday. Tried this location being that we are big fans of the mojitos. We've tried them all over the place this place didn't disappoint us.  Carlos our bartender did the best mojitos we've have tried ever. From Puerto Rico to Cuba hands down this guys knows what's he's doing. Very professional and made us feel like home. He's an example of true bartender.   We tried mojitos passion fruit and coconut 10+
5348,"This is best place to have great food and drinks it was great,  music was just right feels like in the Island, indeed coming back for sure"
5349,"Came here yesterday with my sister (our first stop during restaurant week). This was my second time here. Let me start by saying the staff are so nice and bubbly lol. Anyway we started out order wit drinks of course lol. A coconut margarita and coconut Mojito ( we looove coconut drinks lol). They were very good!  We then tried the empanadas all except the shrimp (allergy reasons). They were pretty good, a little greasy but good. For our on entree I had the mango glazed salmon with rice and beans. Initially I thought the glaze was too much but it turn really good. I would definitely have it again. My sister had the ropa veija with rice and beans. I guess it was good since she cleaned the plate lol. And last but not least for 2 of my favorites, Flan and churros . If your out looking for Cuban food be sure to check this place out. The atmosphere and food is great. If going during restaurant week be sure to ask for the restaurant week menu. ENJOY!"
5350,"I was there tonight with My 2 birthday girls, Jessica and Kelly. Ya Maria, Josephine and Me, Helga.  IVAN WAS A ROCKSTAR! He made us all feel so special. Thank You Ivan. The waiter took great care us too. The food and drinks were amazing. We will return soon. Thanks again,Las Chicas"
5351,"I had the worst experience here. I asked 3 times for my chicken well done, 3 times it was brought out raw!!! I refused to eat and paid for my appetizers, go to pee and Ofcourse nooooo toilet paper!!!!!the worst!!!,9"
5352,"The ambiance for a latin restaurant is nice. There's- Good upbeat music, servers/ hosts are welcoming, the seats are moderately comfortable... they have a happy hour. What more do you need?We had a mixed group of picky eaters, Latin lovers, and vegetarians. Which is a hard accommodation to suit everyone in the crowd.  The food portion is good and it is not heavily salted (we are accustomed to mom's cooking which I guess is salted / with more Sazon). It was filling. With just enough room for dessert several of our party got the tres leches and flan. The flan came with ice cream a nice treat... it was so good the plates were practically licked. I would visit again. It's a great location and for the price / location it's very reasonable."
5353,"I've been to this restaurant about 3 times before and it was great. This time around, it was not good at all. The only reason why it is getting 2 stars is because the service was okay and the drink that I ordered (coquito) was delicious. Now let's talk about the food. We ordered the chicharrones de pollo and 3 different empanadas for appetizers. The chicken was not cooked like ""chicharrones"" it was just soft chicken with a lot of fat on the skin. The empanadas we order was one chicken sofrito, one beef picadillo and one shrimp sofrito. The beef and shrimp filling was good but the actual patty that it is in was soft and not crispy at all. It was if it was put in a microwave. The chicken one was inedible.  On to our meals. I ordered the Ropa Vieja and my husband ordered the Cuban sandwich with no pickles and sweet potatoes fries as a side. My husband's meal had pickles on his sandwich and had regular fries. Now yes, you can ""pick off"" the pickles but as you know, once pickles sit on bread, the juice of the pickle seeps into the bread you can still taste it. The pork was so dry and bland. My dish was not good at all. The meat was super chewy. It started to have a gum feeling to it after chewing it for so long. It was not good at all. We both took one bite of our meal and left it there. We did not say anything to the waiter as it is NOT the waiters fault. We paid our bill and left. We took it as this is one restaurant we will never try again."
5354,We enjoyed everything about this place. The drinks were so good and the food? Oh the food is great! I appreciated the vaccine requirement and all the guests were spaced out well for an extra layer of safety. Service was FAST and the food was delivered hot....things I love and appreciate so much! We visited from out of state and chose Havana based on its reviews... they did NOT disappoint! We definitely plan to return :)
5355,The food here is so delicious.  Been here several time.  Both business and pleasure.  Today I took a friend and we both left very happy.  Will go back every time I'm in the area.
5356,"Everything about our experience was positive! From actually checking our vaccine cards at the host stand, to the wait staff professionalism and menu explanations and suggestions and the truly awesome tasting food! Great food! Great service! Great time!Definitely recommend and will go there again in the future! Reservations recommended."
5357,"We had the best time at Havana tonight. The food was amazing, absolutely delicious. The service was fantastic from the moment we checked in with the hostess. We are a family with two young kids (7&2) and they were very accommodating. Sang happy birthday to our daughter and gave both our children beautiful hats to take home. The ambiance was happy, great Latin music. Overall the best dining experience we've had in New York so far."
5358,"The location is convenient in Times Square, they have outdoor sitting also, the restroom was clean. Drinks were good and food was ok. Didn't try the dessert because we only saw the server one . Food came quick , but had to ask for Silverware‍. The service wasn't the best so I couldn't give it more point which is unfortunate because the table across from the us felt the same way."
5359,The appetizer sampler was the perfect lunch portion and perfect sampling of different dishes
5360,Yummy American BBQ in Queens! Fall off the bone ribs! Delicious burnt ends to die for! My waiter was very nice and made sure everything was going great superb service! Their burgers were so good I craving for it right now as i'm typing this review! Hahah!
5361,"Ok so like Stained sang, It's been awhile. So after moving to LIC a few years back I stopped writing.  Well this is the perfect reason to start back up. After tasting the worst food I've eaten in 3 years we see a black hair in the chicken sandwich container (pictures attacked). I've got brown hair and she has blonde.  Disgusting. I mean just gross. The chicken sandwich, with the hair, tasted like bun on bun no chicken flavor at all.  The fries that came with it were soggy and cold.  The ribs (pictured) had 1/2 the meat and 2 bones. Tasteless. The porkbelly (pictured) was pure fat.  Gross.  The pulled pork was wet and slimy.  I mean wet??  The Mac and cheese was like cardboard.  How??The slaw was the best part of the meal.  I really enjoyed it.  Note to the chef.....keep your hair out of the slaw because it was the only plus to that meal."
5362,"Ordered $69 worth of food for take outs . I was so excited for the food after seeing good reviews . But the food has no flavor at all .Fries is soggy , the brisket sandwich is super dry and flavorless. Burnt end is the best of all but except of a tad of sweetness and a slight smoky flavor it has no salt at all.Chicken wings I asked for sauce aside but the chicken wings itself has no seasoning at all.I'm super disappointed with the food and me and my husband end up eating instant ramen for dinner .""meat Candy"" Beef Burnt Ends"
5363,Stopped by for weekend brunch. We ordered the French toast and an omelet with 2 coffees. The food was pretty tasteful and the unlimited coffee was a great option. Our waitress was also very attentive and friendly. Minus 1 star because.. our French toast came with one strawberry that was quartered. We asked for a little more and they charged us an additional $2 for a strawberry.It's not really the price I'm upset about but some disclosure would have been appreciated. I dislike finding surprises on the bill.
5364,"Solid 3+ Happy to have this smoked meat and BBQ alternative in Queens. The beer on tap was fresh, and as it was a quiet evening, we had plenty of attention from the staff. Our dishes came out pretty quickly, hot and fresh: burnt ends, pulled pork, half racks and a combo plate. Everything was tasty. We were reminded that cornbread and slaw, included with most plates, are very good and relatively generous sides. You will not leave hungry - yes the food is heavy by nature, but portions are also generous. Our understanding is the owner is on premises, and this is a straight-up small business crafting a unique product and serving Astoria. Have recommended Butcher Bar and will continue to visit - go and enjoy!"
5365,"I think this is the most underrated brunch on 30th Ave. The Shady Lady two blocks away had too long of a wait so came here on a Sunday around 1:30 and it was empty.Let me tell you. The food is f**k*ng great. I had the hot and spicy benedict and it was MASSIVE and delicious. They use corn bread instead of English muffins and omg it's a game changer. Boyfriend had the quesadilla and he liked it. We also shared the brisket hash and burnt ends as our sides. Love. Amazing. All the meats. So good.Oh, and their bloodies aren't bad either."
5366,Place is awesome. The animal burger had me ready for bed. Great portions and big flavors. The Mac and cheese is a hit and made to order. Restaurant had a nice crowd and the staff was extremely friendly.
5367,"I lived in the Midwest for 8 years and have been on a quest to find some decent BBQ and Butcher Bar delivered!! First our cocktails were phenomenal- margaritas and lemonade was amazing. I haven't had cocktails these enjoyable in a while. I ordered the porky platter. It was enough to take home for seconds! The ribs were fall off the bone, juicy, finger licking good!!! Next was the pulled pork which was wonderfully seasoned and also moist. The pork belly was just okay. The corn bread pieces were moist and a good compliment to the dish. Standard cole slaw. The brussel sprouts with bacon were grilled to a nice crisp exterior, uneven salting!! But the bacon gave it a nice rich taste. I need to come back STAT!!Service was pretty bad for the outdoor dining, maybe they were busy inside!"
5368,Delicious barbecue place in NYC! (Or Astoria). As someone who loves brisket and most importantly sides it was hard to find a place in New York that served barbecue style food. It's just great barbecue. Typically I am picky about when it comes to wings but the wings here were so good! They were very meaty juicy while at the same crispy and crunchy on the outside. They have different options for the sauce but we got sweet and spicy which is my favorite kind of barbecue sauce. For my entree I got the beef lover entree but they were unfortunately out of the burnt ends for the evening so I substituted with the smoked turkey. The brisket was very tender and fall apart in your mouth. I was surprised at how juicy the Turkey was as well! The platter comes with your choice of a side and cornbread/ cole slaw/ pickles. The cornbread was very moist and sweet! For my side I got the creamy Mac and cheese and it was packed with flavor and the cheese sauce was delicious! I will be back for the burnt ends :)
5369,"Ordered delivery - first of all they charge .50 for every half ass filled little container of sauce... they forgot part of the order (pricey too).. the pulled chicken was dry. Dont see the hype. Not gonna order again.. too many other better places that offer better service, prices and product. Not impressed."
5370,I enjoyed the barbecue. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. My friend ordered the 1/2 lb brisket $15. I tried it and found it quite good. He also had a side of German Potato Salad which was excellent.  You sit at long tables with bench seating. The condiments are hot and sweet barbecue and hot mustard. I piled on the hot barbecue to moisten my sandwich. It was very hot but I discovered that the potato salad killed the sting. They have a full bar. I had wine my friend a craft beer. When you enter the place you see a case with the meet. The air is full of the smell of burnt ends . ( I  was not a fan of the smoky air. ) After you place your order which is ready immediately you take your  food  to your table. The bartender brings your drinks .I am not a lover of barbecue but if I was going to have barbecue I would return
5371,"Pretty much the best BBQ in NYC. Fette Sau has the right casual atmosphere and the right approach to smoking meats. Stand in line, order by the pound, and then grab a picnic table. As BBQ should be. Lines can get pretty long at peak times, but weeknights are pretty darn chill. I've been several times over the years.The food leans toward the Texas style of dry-rub beef and sausage, but it's not particularly stuck on any one regional style. The pulled pork is good, the specials are good, and the sides are good  too (although I wish they had some more of the traditional BBQ sides in addition to their excellent beans and sort of untraditional broccoli). There are several different sauces as well, so you'll definitely find something to suit whichever preferences you might have in terms of meat and regional style. Vinegar-based thin sauce for Carolina pulled pork? Check. Sweet sticky sauce suited for St Louis ribs? Check. Yellowish mustardy sauce for the sausage and whatever else? Check!How does it stack up to other places around NYC? Well you *could* go to Blue Smoke for some really good meat, but their atmosphere is all wrong, it's like an east coast steakhouse or something. It just ain't right. There's that place in Red Hook too, some people swear by it, but I can't remember what it's called, and it's not worth looking up because the meat isn't anything special. Most other places just give you oven-cooked meats slathered in sauce, which is honestly an insult to BBQ lovers everywhere.You can trust me. Fette Sau rocks. I grew up traveling around the northeast to check out BBQ competitions around with my family as a kid. My parents were BBQ fiends and we did plenty of backyard smoking ourselves as well. I live in Texas now, where BBQ is a religion. Fette Sau is up there with the best."
5372,It's delicious but I feel the portion is too small. They should be a little more generous with the ribs and brisket
5373,"A tasty BBQ joint when you need your Texas BBQ fix. The location of the restaurant is unassuming, almost like an alleyway. As you walk in, the open outdoor concept reminds me of BBQ places in Texas and also adds to the dining experience. I was invited here for an impromptu dinner with my BFs family. We ordered a variety of meats, from BBQ ribs, pulled pork, brisket & burnt ends. I have to say, aren't burnt ends everyone's fave? I really enjoyed the burnt ends mixed with beans, delicious! The BBQ ribs & brisket were on par and the sides complimented well with the meats. Ironically, I have dined at their Philadelphia location when I lived in Philly for graduate school and it is as good as I remembered. Consistency is A plus for me."
5374,"Wow what happened?I used to love this place.  My wife and I wanted BBQ, my favorite bbq place in NYC used to be Fette.  My friends and I would come here and gorge ourselves.Today we got ribs, brisket and pulled pork.The ribs were ok but very greasy.  The brisket was ok but a little dry.  Nothing special.The pulled pork was horrible.  Inedible.  I am not sure why they would even serve us what they served us.  It was a pile of gross, dry, grease.   86 an item if this what you are going to sell.Won't be back.  NYC luckily has plenty of other BBQ options."
5375,Staff are Frustrated -Angry rude transplants that are mad they can't keep up to the fast pace of New York
5376,"I thought the meats here were ok. The brisket and ribs were a little too fatty, but the sausage and pulled pork were pretty flavorful. My favorite things honestly were the sides of potato salad and baked beans. Baked beans were sooo good and a must try. Full of sauce with bits of meat in it.They also have a lot of whiskey flights at the bar which was a plus."
5377,They have a ton of seating and great food options. Some of the meat is too rich for me to eat but my partner adores it.
5378,"Went in for pick up and got the brisket sandwich lunch special. i think the lunch specials appeared to be in person only and not on any online or delivery menus, and those seemed like solid deals.Sandwich was super solid, their spicy BBQ sauce was awesome, and the kicker was their awesome BBQ pork and beans. Curious to try out other parts of their menu, and looks like a fun spot when it can fully re open capacity-wise."
5379,"Honestly the BBQ here is a bit overpriced and not that good. There's nothing special about it though it's not bad either. The sauce is good and the sides were enjoyable, but at the price they're asking for you'd expect much higher quality and tastier meats and sides."
5380,"Cuisine: 6Service: 7Decor: 6Value: 6Overall: 6Maybe it's the pandemic, because my last few experiences at this BBQ joint have been better. Unfortunately, the food was just not how I remember it to be.Bershire Pork Belly - very smokey, tender and juicy, but it was way too fatty.Black Angus Brisket - Smokey and tender too, but definitely was not juicy.St. Louis Style Pork Ribs - Looks really dry, yet tasted surprisingly good.Jalapeño Pork Sausages - I should have ordered one more of these.Potato Salad - nothing specialBeans w/ Burnt Ends - quite goodMy friend and I both thought that the meal was average overall and not what we came here for. I hope to return again after these crazy times and find the restaurant that's in my memory."
5381,Everyone was very friendly here. The food was out of this world and I will 10/10 be coming back to this place for quality BBQ
5382,"It is hard to believe that there used to be a time when Fette Sau was the best Texas BBQ in NYC.Then came Hometown BBQ, and Fette Sau is almost uneatable for me now.Before I had Hometown BBQ, Fette Sau didn't seem so bad, but after Hometown BBQ, there is no going back eating dry ass brisket from Fette Sau, and countless other BBQ joints.As you might have noticed,  I judge a Texas BBQ joint by how good their brisket is, because it is  so damn hard to cook a good brisket!It's a cheap cut that is extremely prone to drying out, and most restaurant f it up royally. And Fette Sau is no exception, I mean why would you ever leave your brisket exposed, basking under a freaking lamp?! and not surprisingly, DRY brisket.This, plus the price is almost the same as Hometown, there is no reason to come here, unless you can't make it trek out to redhook or industry city."
5383,"So, after 7 years, I finally came back, this time with 4 friends.  Going to keep this one short compared to my novel last time.  Ordered some brisket, pulled pork, sausage, and pork cheek.  The brisket was pretty good, and hands down the best part of the meal.  The pulled pork was genuinely bad, i almost didn't want to eat it that's how much I disliked it, it had some really off flavor, almost a sour flavor to it (no, it was not a vinegar flavor), the sausage was okay, not amazing but not bad in any way, and the pork cheek was good, a little overdone and tough, but still had some smokey flavor to it.The place seems similar to when I was there years ago, and I wish I could put together a better performance of meats to have a quality experience, but there is always something that is so bad that it makes me wonder why I ordered food.  Was there something quite delicious, yes, but the pulled pork was so bad...Again, will I be back, probably, but prob not anytime soon."
5384,"Amazing ribs and brisket!!! This place is worth the hype indeed. Especially during COVID, there is no wait or line and the food was ready much earlier than GrubHub said. There is also outdoor seating for those interested. The dry rub on the ribs was amazing and the brisket was by far some of the best brisket I have ever had probably the best in NYC. Amazing food"
5385,Drove all the way from NJ for this BBQ and was very disappointed. The brisket was dry asf and the burnt end beans were burnt.  This place usually hits the spot. Wasted my money and time for this meal.
5386,"I don't mean to give it a low rating, don't be fooled by the star system. I really hate that it has to be a full star. I would like to give it 3 1/2 stars. Basically the food is pretty good, but it's pretty expensive. And you have to be very careful when you order because you can end up in the poorhouse. If you think you can eat a lot of meat, tried to dial back and get less. You can always go up and get seconds. I'm sure the owners don't want to see a review like this. That said, I would recommend the brisket it is very very good."
5387,"came for lunch on a sunday. brisket, beef cheek, and pulled pork were great. ribs and chicken wings were dry, but had good flavor. things could've done with a bit more salt/seasoning, but the vinegar and mustard sauces were able to supplement. I've come to fette sau multiple times before from 2014-2017 and while this visit's bbq still didn't disappoint, it didn't taste as moist/delicious as i know fette sau can be. sadly my fav side, the broccoli, is now way too overcooked.great service and outdoor seating is available."
5388,"YES, YES, a thousand times YES! Went here for the first time this week & im obsessed. The staff was amazing and so helpful when it came to deciding how much food to get for me and my friends. The pulled pork was my favorite meat. The brisket & ribs were also delicious. The chicken wings looked amazing, I'll be getting them next time. The cole slaw was poppin & so were the burnt ends baked beans. Go ASAP!!!"
5389,"Nice location, tucked into a little alley which they use as their outdoor patio. They have a good selection of beers and liquor. They have general selection of meat, from ribs, wings, brisket and sausage. Now it is quite pricey but I guess it's also the location. Brisket is $15 for 1/2lb. Flavor is really good."
5390,"Wow, wow, wow. I don't understand the hype. I've had my fair share of BBQ and I can say this place is just hype. Let's start off with the food.Food is Okay, not great, not horrible, just okay. Beef brisket was moist, or was it because it was like 80% fat. Sausages were partially uncooked inside. Ribs, probably the top 5 Worst ribs I've had. They were tough, didn't really fall off the bone, and I had a good jaw workout getting through them. Coleslaw-average. Cornbread-average. Sauces-good. Beans-averagePrice. Okay, I get it. NYC is going to give $15 minimum wage in exchange for $15 Big Mac Meals. I get it. Prices are crazy. Inflation is exorbitant. The dollar is getting weak. People are unemployed. Economy is going to shite. I'm still having a quarter life crisis. What. Back to price. I got half a pound of brisket (mostly fat)- $15, two sausages-$12, Cornbread 2/$5, Small cup of Beans- $7, coleslaw-$7, Glass bottle of coke- $5, 4 pieces of Rib-$25, Tip for a rude cashier-$10. I paid close to $85. Now, that sounds like a lot of food, but read it in depth. 4 PIECES OF BAD RIBS FOR $25. WHO TF CHARGES $25 BUCKS FOR 4 PIECES OF RUBS. HOW DOES A COKE COST $5 BUCKS. Coming to this restaurant showed everything wrong with NYC. Crappy food, exorbitant prices, rude service, potholes, gentrification, and Bill De Blasio.The guy who gave us our meats, he was nice. I kind of feel bad giving the bad review cause he was nice, but the meat and price weren't nice. The cashier=Williamsburg Karen. Idk if that makes sense, hope it does. My friend and I were literally looking at the menu, and this cashier looks at us and says ""Something wrong with you guys?"" Who tf says that. What's wrong with you B? After giving her the card for our meal, she says some cringe lines: ""Feel free to write a tip on this line, in appreciation for our time."" That might not have been the exact lines, but you get the point. tl;drFood 3/5Price 1/5Service 3/5Person that read this review until the end 10/10"
5391,"Great selection of meats. One of the best bbq joints in NYC. But don't listen to the guy cutting the meats when ordering your 'Q. Trust your gut. He thinks he knows the right size portions but he is wrong. You definitely won't have enough food when you get home. Lost a star because the worker cutting is kinda pushy although the woman behind the register was super friendly and nice. I wanted to order for 5 and he thought 3 pounds of brisket, five ribs (one per person!?), 1.5 pound of pork belly, and 1.5 of pork cheek was enough? The brisket and burnt ends (in beans) are the best. Then the ribs and maybe the sausage. The pork belly is way too fatty unless you like it that way. You're basically paying for fat. The pork cheeks have an interesting flavor and chewiness. Not my type of meat. It looks better than it tastes."
5392,"We came on a weekday around 6 p.m. and were blessed with absolutely no wait to order and grab seats. Hooray for the perks of visiting post-summer.The ribs were my favorite part of the meal. Smoky, decently tender, and they paired perfectly with some of Fette Sau's sweet barbecue sauce slathered on top. The brisket was also decently flavorful and not too fatty. The spicy pork sausage was fine, but sausage usually isn't my go-to barbecue item anyway. As for sides, the burnt ends baked beans were good, although I didn't see or taste the smoky bits of meat. The cornbread, on the other hand, was hard as a rock and very dry.The meal was fine but not particularly memorable, so $64 for two people was too hot for my wallet. I'm glad I got to try this place out sans the crazy wait times, and it's got a few good items for sure, but it's not really worth the hype in my opinion."
5393,"Barbecue is my favorite food. And once upon a time, the pickin's were pretty slim in NYC, and Fette Sau was one of the only games in town.Sure, there were Dallas BBQs all over, but I'm not talking about poorly boiled/roasted ribs with sweet sauce dumped over it, I'm talking about  the real deal, meat smoked low and slow until it's the tastiest treat you've ever tasted. Well, times have changed and there's a few great barbecue spots in Brooklyn alone now. So for whatever reason (mostly geography), it's been probably a decade since I'd been to Fette Sau. Having come back in and demolished a giant platter with a couple friends, I'm happy to report they've still got it. If I had to judge by this one recent visit I would say it's no longer the best in town, but you won't be sad about running through some brisket, ribs, broccoli salad, the wings on special, and more. The smoked old fashioned is also surprisingly high quality cocktail, and pairs well with all that fatty meat.  Go nuts."
5394,"Fabulous spot and probably my favorite BBQ spot I've had in New York. Everything here is delectable and tastes straight from the south, with a good variety of different barbecue sauces and meats. I usually get some kind of sampler with multiple options but the brisket is my favorite. It's got a fun ambiance and is a great spot to bring a friend (when covid is over, anyway). I haven't been here during the pandemic so I can't speak to if they have outdoor dining/what the situation is here but I always look forward to coming back."
5395,"THE BAKED BEANS SIDE DISH IS SO GOOD. I would even just order this as my main. It's got meat in it and the sauce is nice and tangy (better than the other sauces out on the tables).We got the beef brisket, pork shoulder, and pork ribs. I wish the ribs had more meat on them & the brisket was juicier. I appreciated how the server proportioned our meal for us based on the number of people in our party & the number of mains we wanted. On a Saturday around 6:30pm we waited in line for a good 30 min before we got to order.If you've ever been to Green Street Smoked Meats in Chicago, this place is basically that!"
5396,"I feel bad for writing this review during such a crazy time, but as of now, when all the restaurants are closed for dine in services and your entire business is run by delivery or take out - one would hope you get everything right.I felt like ordering cocktails and saw they offered cocktail deliveries, so I decided to order dinner here.Ordered the following items:Black Angus Brisket - description says half sour pickle and two Martin's potato roll. We got no pickle and only one roll. 50% of the 1/2 lb of meat was fat. Never been to a place where they just offered you fat, so it's pretty much not edible in my opinion.Duroc Pulled Pork - again, supposed to come with half sour pickle and two rolls, no pickle and just one roll. I liked this, but super disappointed about the missing items.Kentucky Sweet Tea - not sure what makes this Kentucky, since the tea is made in NJ. Bloody Mary - it was good, and it had body, but not as good as Employee's Only version.I want to say if I am going to pay over 100 dollars for this meal and had to pay service fee, delivery fee, and tip. I would like to have everything be included as described and not have items missing from the order and this is my reason for the 2 stars. Because why am I paying extra for missing items? Super disappointed."
5397,"A little pricey, but some of the BEST BBQ in Williamsburg. This is coming from someone who lived in the South. Definitely a MUST TRY if you're in the neighborhood..."
5398,"We were on our way to another restaurant but as we were walking by Fette Sau, the environment drew us in. The decor and feel of the place is great. We also heard about Fette Sau before and we were excited to randomly pass by and eat some bbq! We got 1/4 lb servings of pork belly, brisket, and chicken wings. Also got the baked beans, cornbread, and a coke. Our total came out to around $40, but it didn't look or taste like $40. Pork belly and brisket weren't tough, but were cold. The chicken wings were both tough and cold. Baked beans, cornbread, and coke were good but still overpriced. Now for the sauces, no labels to say what the bottles contain. Personally, I thought the sauces tasted much better mixed together rather than by themselves. The yellow and brown sauce mixed and the red and dark red sauces mixed were tasty. tl;dr - sadly underwhelming"
5399,"Get the brisket...that's what the bf said. Went to Fette Sau on Sunday evening upon arriving at Williamsburg. He had remembered the restaurant from past visit to serve up good BBQ up in NYC. Fette Sau does not disappoint. He had gotten the brisket, ribs, sausages and coleslaw. The ribs and sausage paled in comparison to the brisket. The latter has a nice bark, great smoke flavor albeit a little fatty if you had gotten the end piece but he proclaimed it especially flavorful.There are outdoor seatings at the restaurant and you can also order your food inside the restaurant or via delivery app. Prices are a little steep but understandably so as it is NYC. We've paid more for mediocre food in some restaurants in NYC. Overall this place is a solid BBQ place and definitely worth stopping by of you are in the area."
5400,"My staple BBQ place in Williamsburg. Hands down the best brisket you can find within the area. I've been here numerous of times and cannot express my love for it. It's more of a self-service type of restaurant. You will find yourself waiting in line to order, then pay and seat yourself."
5401,"I love fresh fire/wood cooked meat. It brings back great memories of my grandparents farm. But nostalgia aside, it's really hearty, great tasting food. You'll be full and happy when you leave"
5402,"Overpriced. Lots of BBQ options in the same area with just as good or even better meats & 100% better prices & sides! I payed $6 for a small can of soda- should've just got a beer with a shot for less!Also the sides were underwhelming and only about 3 to choose from, only one size available. Just very mehh overall. Also the dude at the cash-wrap had an attitude."
5403,"I don't know what happened to this place but clearly it's not what it was from 10 years ago. 1. It's expensive. 2. Beef brisket was all fat. They served the ends of the brisket to us. 95% fat. 3. Pork sausage link was just decent. John Brown's sausage link in LIC is far superior. 4. Ribs were not fall off the bone and rather dry. 5. The little ass piece of corn bread was $5? If you haven't tried John Browns corn bread, you should. It's the best. And they give you a lot. The broccoli and beans with burnt ends were decent but not worth the price they're charging. Overall, the meal was expensive and disappointing. If you want really good bbq, head over to John Browns."
5404,"Holy shit is this amazing BBQ.  These are absolutely the best ribs I've ever had.  They have a thick black delicious crust and are super tender at the same time.  The burnt ends are fabulous and the pulled pork is the best in the city.  Cornbread is is solid too.  Their house beer is a perfect match.  On top of all this, they had a really chill guy playing a mix of old time hits live.  Just go and support this local gem."
5405,Great pulled pork and pickles. Good for a quick brunch. They had a great musician playing when we went.
5406,"I feel like this place may be overhyped. Despite the sausage being excellent everything else was rather average. I'd choose the mission bbq chain over this place. For entrees the bacon ends were basically just thick cut bacon. The pork and brisket were moist and decent but required you use their sauces. their sauces were nothing rememerable. Their yellow Georgia mustard like ayce was the best. The other two bbq sauces were meh and the vinegar too dark and thick to be anything like nc eastern style.The potato salad was okay. I wish it would have been creamier and cut into smaller potato chunks. The baked beans spoke of burnt ends. There was no meat that I could see in our side. They were just okay.Would I go back? For the price and location, Probably not."
5407,Really good bbq. The brisket and ribs are amazing. Great place to go with friend. Especially on a summer evening.
5408,"Great food, beverages and vibe. We looking the sides and enjoy the well seasoned meat."
5409,"As my tour of New York continued, I would have never found this BBQ joint if it wasn't for a New Yorker who loves BBQ as much as me.  While we were waiting outside another BBQ joint, he started listing other BBQ joints in the NYC area.  I made a list of them and Fette Sau was the one I ended up at by convenience of my location.  I want to thank that guy so much because he directed me to one of the best BBQ joints I have had.Fette Sau was a little difficult to locate because on the street, there is an arch with the words ""Fette Sau."" That leads into what looks like an alley, but it opens up to an area with tables and wood.  Finally, you will reach the indoors part where the counter and bar is located. There are several long tables so be expecting to eat in a community like setting. The wall had a huge picture of the different cuts of meat.  This is definitely a dive!I go to the counter and tell the guy I came all the way from Alabama to try this BBQ.  He appreciated that as I made my selection of a rib, 1/4 lb. pork, 1/4 brisket  and baked beans.  It came out to $31.  Why is BBQ so expensive in NYC? Haha But it was worth it.This was truly Texas-inspired BBQ! All meats came with a housemade rub.The pork and brisket were tender and juicy.  The brisket had a superior black pepper rub and good amount of fat to add to it's flavor.  The brisket was easily among the best I have ever had.  The rib was had a good rub and easy to chew.  Beans were made with burnt ends for a smoky flavor.There are 4 sauces - sweet, vinegar, mustard, and spicy.  All sauces are made with beer by the way, which I thought was unique. I liked all of them but the vinegar was my least favorite. It only went well with the pork. The sweet was a heavy ketchup base with brown sugar.  The mustard was a solid sauce.  But my favorite was the Spicy.  It really wasn't very spicy but had more of a chili-like flavor and made with several different peppers.  It was an unique sauce.I never expected to find exceptional BBQ in NYC, but that is what you will find at Fette Sau."
5410,"Gives me the wiggle yums! We call it ""Fat Saul's""  but I don't think that's correct. Delish spot."
5411,"This is the best American bbq restaurant in NYC. Their brisket is so tender it melts in your mouth that you wouldn't even need to have teeth to eat this. Their pickles are very interesting, not as sour as I like but still a great hint of acidity. I love their mustard potato salad. I can't eat mayonnaise but this place allows me to enjoy a potato salad and it is a great contrast to the meat. I also love their burnt ends. I also love their cornbread. Basically long story short there is nothing I don't love from here."
5412,"This place is a little overrated and definitely overpriced. Sure, NY doesn't have a ton of BBQ options and Williamsburg has even less, so if you have a craving, you are bound to come here. But the prices are jaw dropping and the meat is pretty dry. I couldn't bring myself to paying 20 bucks for 3 spare ribs, so we got the half a pound of beef brisket ($15), half a pound of pulled pork shoulder ($12), and burnt ends baked beans with beef and pork ($7.5). The salads were pricey, so we decided to have a protein only kind of meal. This way we didn't break the bank just to try the famous Fette Sau. Both the brisket and pork shoulder packed flavor and were nicely burnt on the outer layer, but were extremely dry and got cold instantly. I go for BBQ in hopes of eating soft, juicy meat and I found myself forcing to finish the meat because we paid a lot for it. The burnt ends baked beans were my favorite: they stayed warm throughout, packed a ton of flavor, and the mixed in beef and pork blended well with the sauce of the beans. On a Saturday night, Fette Sau is packed and you'd be glad to find seats. Most people end up holding their tray of meat in their hands for 10 minutes waiting in front of seated customers, glaring at them and guilting them into finishing their meals quickly so that they can hop on their seats the moment they stand up. Not a happy sight."
5413,"Very average, very expensive for what you get. I ordered 3 meats and 3 sides and the total was over $70 with no drinks. The highlight of the meal were the burnt end beans $7.50 for a small cupful. Delicious!! The pork belly, ribs and brisket were all ok. Being a master KCBS judge I might be a little more critical than most, but that's how I felt. The potato salad was good and the cornbread decent. Better than Boston Market if that means anything for you The place filled up quickly. Its a shared bench/table for eating which I enjoy."
5414,"One of my friends recommended that we try this place since it was by his house. And I do love me some bbq. You can almost miss it if walking by so look up to see the sign. They have some tables outside that are heated but probably not warm enough for winter time.The restaurant inside is pretty small. You order at the counter and they bring you your food. The selections of meats are good. The side selection is just ok. My friends and I ordered 4 of the meats and some sides. The meats were decent, the sides weren't really good at all.I guess the biggest turn off of all was the fact we left a cash tip, but the woman at the counter was aggressively asking for more tip on the credit card portion. Almost to the point it makes you uncomfortable. I'm sorry but you don't get a 20% tip when all you're doing is ringing us up and dropping the food off. And to pressure your customers that way is not good business.Needless to say, it left a bad taste in our mouth and we won't be back. Only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the meat was decent."
5415,There isn't one thing on the menu that I haven't tried that wasn't delish.  Everything is amazing! Keep rocking it !
5416,"Are you kidding me?!  How is this place even in business?  2 lb St. Louis ribs, 1/2 lb brisket, a tiny portion of Mac and cheese and corn bread=$100.00???The ribs....tough, very little accessible meat on the bone.  The brisket; dry.   The Mac n cheese-did a nursery school make it-vile.  Staff:nasty and angry that we did not tip for this take out order.  Who writes these positive review.  Surely relatives ow owners or staff.   Lousy. Just plain lousy AND ABSURDLY over priced"
5417,Omg. I'm from the south and miss a meat and three something fierce. I loved their food and their drinks. The pork belly and their sauces were unforgettable. Will be returning to try everything!
5418,"I wouldn't say the barbecue served here was the best I ever had, but it was decent and good enough when my friends and I stopped by one evening. We split an order of ribs, baked beans and brisket. You also got to decide on how many rolls you can get. Be warned though, that Fette Sau is slightly more expensive than your typical barbecue joint. There was communal styled seating on wooden tables and benches and you have to seat yourselves. No waitstaff here. Paper towels and condiments are provided at the tables and disposable plates are provided at the counter where you order.The meats were spiced and smoked nicely and the baked beans had bits of meat in it, so that was a plus. Again, the meats were good, but nothing to write home about. Overall, I'd say stop by here if you're in the area and craving barbecue, but there are far better options out there such as Pig Beach and John Brown's Smokehouse."
5419,"Came here during Covid-19, lots of outdoor seating. Only some seating under the shade fyi. The brisket is excellent and overall a tasty meaty overload"
5420,"I was planning on eating dinner later in the day, but my plans suddenly changed at 5:00 pm and I was near Fette Sau and decided to see if I could get in without too much of a wait.  I pulled up and found a legal parking space directly across the street and then walked in to find a few empty tables and absolutely no line (first time I've ever seen that!). I took a look and ordered a nice mix of Burnt Bacon Ends, Pork shoulder and Beef Brisket. I was reasonable and only ordered a 1/4 of each and then sat down with a chatty and friendly couple from Korea (all those empty tables had filled up while I was on line ;-)As always, the BBQ was superb and definitely worthy of the best of NYC title!"
5421,"I'm so happily full from this place. If you love barbecue and meat, and are looking for a place not super Manhattan or mainstream, DEFINITELY check this restaurant out. I think this is a great place to go with a couple friends, so you can all share a tray. That makes the meal cheaper too, and you can try more meats and appetizers. My two friends and I split two appetizers and three half pounds of meat, and it was more than enough. We were all super full by the end and they also give complimentary rolls per person. The restaurant is a little pricey, so don't expect a very affordable mom and pop grill place, but I promise the barbecue is worth it, especially for Williamsburg prices. FOOD:Baked beans (5/5) - I could eat spoonfuls of this alone for dinner. These beans were the perfect pairing with the brisket sandwiched in a roll. The flavor was smoky, with a light tomato finish. So unique!Potato salad (3/5) - I actually didn't love this dish even though I like all types of potato. There was too much sauce on the potatoes and they were just a bit too sour. This dish is also kind of heavy paired with all the oily meat.Brisket (5/5) - This may have been the best brisket I've ever had. There was a perfect balance of lean versus fatty meat and the meat was so tender that the lightest touch of the knife sliced the pieces down the middle. The outer edge was just a little crisp and burnt. Order this for sure if you go.Ribs (5/5) - The ribs were juicy and tender, and fell off the bone. They were charred on the outside but still so soft once you got past the initial bite. Chicken (4/5) - I thought this dish was yummy but nothing particularly special. It was just your ordinary chicken drumstick dish, slightly spicy. We got the dry rub."
5422,"Not sure if you guys offer delivery these days, but it wouldn't matter to me, since I'm located on the other side of the city. I just wanted to send my love and support for a place that has always had a special place in my heart (and stomach). I hope you are all well and safe, and I look fwd to letting your brisket melt in my mouth again."
5423,"This is just the best BBQ in North Brooklyn hands down. (I can't speak for South Brooklyn. I don't know from South BKBBQ) but everything here is delicious. It also gets extra points for having been around for as long as it has at this point. I couldn't give it the full five star treatment, though because I'll be DAMNED if it isn't expensive."
5424,It's safe to say I know more about smoking meat than almost anyone in Brooklyn. So take my word for it - Jimmy and his team are the best in town. The brisket is melt in your mouth tender with a nice bark and so flavorful. The ribs are very tasty - not as tender as I usually like but they are perfectly seasoned and smoked so definitely try them. I should point out the last the only thing better than the food is the service. This team is amazing. Special shout outs to Dawnia and Jeremy but really the whole team is great. Fette Sau is one of my all time favorites.
5425,"Love the atmosphere, very chilled out barbecue joint where on a nice day you can grab a table outside as well. I was worried about this being very crowded having come on Saturday at 6:30pm but was able to easily get a spot for 4. It is self serve for drinks and food (separate counters), the line for food moved fairly quickly. We tried:Black angus beef brisket: texture was not bad- there were some pieces that were less than tenderBerkshire St Louis Pork RibsBerkshire spicy pork sausage: not enough of a punchBerkshire pork belly: this was the best item, melt in your mouth tenderEverything was not bad, I think everything I had could be a little bit more flavorful. It's a really nice place to hang out with friends."
5426,Every single order is perfect - they've never let me down once and the food is always top quality. Some of the top tier barbecue in Brooklyn.
5427,"Have been to this place few times before. It was ok and the meat  was delicious. But this visit was horrible. Meat was completely nothing special taste and have many fat inside (brrrrr) , and I have bad after taste for many hours. The old cashier lady at counter have very mean and not friendly attitude. Like she even almost push me to give a tips(I never saw that before nowhere) and buy their boring sides. Really when you have like this overpriced self service place, at list you can provide friendly and nice workers, like I don't want to pay my money to mean people. So sad that this place is like this now. Never will come back and it's many opportunities in Williamsburg and LES."
5428,"I've been eating here for 10 years now. Came here last night for take out. Got pulled pork, brisket, chicken wings, corn bread, baked beans, cole slaw and frozen whiskey sours. Everything was as delicious as ever! The brisket and the baked beans are some of the best I've ever had anywhere! Chicken wings I had for the first time and they were amazing, super smokey flavor. Last but not least the frozen whiskey sours really topped off this amazing meal. Kudos!"
5429,"Came here on the 5th on a Sunday 15 minutes before opening. They didn't let me in until 12:20 PM. They largely weren't wearing masks until customers came in, and then told customers they couldn't come in without wearing a mask lol. The ones that were wearing masks weren't wearing them well (ill-fitting, etc.)When I came here a year and a half ago, it was amazing. I think, like other reviewers said, it's hit or miss. I think they mass make and then keep things for leftovers. They clearly weren't cooking the bbq when I was there 10-15 min early. The woman with dark brown hair, in her 40s, with brown glasses is a witch. She was late opening the restaurant and a grub hub delivery guy came after me, and I don't know if his race had anything to do with it, but while she was rushing doing my order, she rudely told him, ""Staring at me isn't going to make it better/help."" He wasn't rude or anything even though she's messing with his tip for being late. She then barked at a nice server saying we can't do sandwiches if there's no coleslaw. Good thing as I was watching her and her mask was falling off her face because she forgot a utensil, and I was able to remind her so I wouldn't have to go back. Then I heard her bark at another customer outside. Someone needs to talk to this woman. I'm really disinclined to go back. Oh as for the food not like before. But not bad. Baked beans was delicious but did noottt look like it was cooked that day. Prime rib was juicy and fat. Chicken wings I do not recommend. Broccoli salad I also do not recommend. Also, they don't clean the tables at all. Bbq from days past stuck on them and they didn't wash them to prep in the morning. I was there before 1/3 of the workers were. A few came at like 12:10-12:15. Was thinking of going to Fette Sau, where they were prepping at 11:45 AM, but they didn't open till 1 PM. I guess what can you do. It's Williamsburg time and the 20-year-olds don't wake up till 1.Ok eating the leftovers and they're good. Maybe because I heated it up and when I came they had just stuck them under the heat lamps and maybe were cold from the fridge. Maybe also because it was 90 degrees outside it was hard to enjoy. Maybe also because the customer service was lacking and all the employees were late (hungover from partying?). I may come back. But only when they offer inside dining again at more than 50 percent capacity."
5430,"We came here for dinner and had an amazing dinner. We sat outside, which was nice and warm and so pretty! We had the following:- Fresh baked ""tigelle""  buns with Parma prosciutto: this was amazing and you should definitely get this. The buns were warm and fresh and the prosciutto was sliced perfectly (very thin and melt in your mouth). - Spaghetti alla chitarra con ragu' bolognese:: the pasta was fresh and the sauce was good, but nothing special- Cavatelli di ricotta: I got this without salmon and really enjoyed this pasta dish. The pasta was fresh and the pesto sauce was creamy but not too creamy-duck special: my husband got this dish and loved itOverall, I would recommend visiting this restaurant"
5431,Highlights: truffle risottos; carbonara; & the lamb!!!We also got free cookies. The service was very good! Ambiance
5432,"Had such a lovely evening for our 1 yr anniversary here! Per the reviews we opted for outdoor seating- they're not kidding, it is cramped inside. The floral arch and warm heaters make it cozy with a little more breathing room, literally. We started off with the warm octopus salad. GET THIS. Don't think cold greens with dressing- it's like a warm and flavorful mix of octopus and potatoes with a killer sauce. We also used that free focaccia to dip it in the sauce. For mains we shared the house special pasta with duck ragu and the filet mignon plate. That truffle butter for the steak was fire. The staff was friendly but v busy so nothing over the top but efficient enough considering it was a Friday night and packed. Although I couldn't believe how easy it was to get reservations for the Friday of Valentine's Day weekend. Would def come back and recommend to everyone. Next time we'll try the brunch as I heard there is live music!"
5433,"Definitely the best Italian food I've had in a while! We had a reservation for 6:30 and were promptly seated. They have covered outdoor seating under their stunning pink flower arch, but we sat indoors. It isn't a large place but has a very cozy vibe. The service was very prompt too.I ordered the Cavatelli di Ricotta con Gamberi, Salmone e Salsa al Pesto. The pasta was cooked perfectly, the pesto was fresh, and it came with a generous serving of shrimp and grilled salmon. I haven't had a dish like it before! They have a pretty large menu so I can't wait to come back for dinner again in the future."
5434,"Solid Italian spot - with a wide variety of options on the menu from pasta to meat/seafood dishes.Only downside was that service was a bit slow to begin with and it's one of those restaurants where you are insanely packed in between tables - regardless if you sit inside or outside. We had reservations for 9 PM and were seated in the outdoor seating where there is a roof over your head and very strong heaters.After the slow service got better, we got our dishes and cocktails in a reasonable time. I got the Pappardelle and my boyfriend got the spaghetti. I thought it was really good, not super exceptional; but a solid dish. I got the Ketel One vodka + strawberries drink and the basil/strawberries were a little bit much in the drink in my opinion. Lastly, we got the cheesecake and it was OK. They gave complimentary mini biscotti/cookies at the end of our meal.Overall - solid place, not rushing to come back but the ambiance is nice and cute for date night. Just know that you will be squished in between tables."
5435,Really cute spot in Greenwich - maybe a 3.5 stars that I round to 4My friend and I were looking for a brunch spot since the place we originally planned to go to did not work out. The outside dinning area is really cute with lights and floral vines however the inside dining is more mellow and dimmed so we opted to sit outside.We ordered the - Benedict Aragosta - the eggs were perfectly cook and nice balance of flavor - Campagnola - great when it first came out so finish it fast and don't let it sit!- Fettuccine al Tartufo - our favorite - love the truffle flavor - Tiramisu - ordered it cuz it looked adorable on Yelp but the taste was meh- limoncello - not a fanAlso we have great service! The waiters were friendly and attentive!
5436,Tina's take: 8/10Went here for a date night and the outside is beautiful with the flowers and decor which makes the restaurant very welcoming. However I feel like the outside does not match the inside. The place was very packed which was a nice thing to see during covid times. Since it was so busy I wish they had some music playing because it was very loud. Our waiter was very nice and told us the specials for the night. We didn't get any appetizers but we got Pappardelle which I enjoyed very much.  The capri cocktail was very refreshing and sweet. The flavors came all together and the pasta was great. We also got the Tagliolini neri alle vongole which was alittle overcooked but was good as well. Then for our main I got Zuppa di pesce which was really good and had the perfect amount of spice. Then we got the Stinco Di Agnello which fell off the bone and was amazing. Everything came out quick and hot so it was ready to be enjoyed. For desert we had to get the crème brûlée which was very good to end the night. They also gave us complementary biscottis at the end. It was a nice time and I am happy to see them doing well in these difficult times.
5437,"The outside here has beautiful flower and light decor! Overall the restaurant has really cozy and intimate vibes, including candles and fresh flowers at the table. I'd say the food here isn't cheap, but the quality is good (green flag when they have daily specials). There is complimentary bread with olive oil, and also some biscotti at the end! I got the pork chop dish, and the meat was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside! The corn was grilled well, and my only complaint was that the mushroom sauce was too salty. I was wanting something fresh and bright to balance the salt!Service was very nice and prompt. This would be a good date spot or catch up with friends!"
5438,From the minute you enter this place feels warm welcoming and friendly. The service fast en efficient. The food is divine is 5 stars for me.
5439,"Beautiful, intimate setting & great location ! Stopped by for a cocktail & light bit & was seated immediately . I will definitely come by again to try more items on the menu!"
5440,"The ambiance, food, and service are amazing - so romantic and cozy! The outside has a dome of lights and the inside is warm, and homey with flowers and candles! The waiters, James especially, were extremely inviting and friendly! The food was delicious and we tried a variety of entrees. The pasta was fresh, and the bread was so soft!The octopus was grilled to perfection, seasoned perfectly, and the sauce was delicious! We also tried various desserts !"
5441,"D'Andrea's is amazing! For starters, we enjoyed a flavorful pear, arugula & gorgonzola. We had a delicious Spaghetti Carbobara featuring freshly-made Chitarra pasta, and a luscious ricotta & mushroom filled spinach ravioli. Christian, our waiter, was super attentive and friendly. His  knowledge & pronunciation of the dishes was impeccable! We will definitely be comlng back here very soon. Bravo, and thanks again, Christian!"
5442,"Had a great time. Food was amazing. Fast service. We had a party of 4. Tried calamari, burrata, octopus, pastas and fillet minion. All amazing. Will be back."
5443,"I have my set fave pasta spots in the city and this place has just joined my list. The service from our waiter Marco, was incredible. I had the bolognese and gnocchi which were heavenly. Be back soon!"
5444,"The reservation confirmation stated we would be outside, but all seats were already taken. Inside, the place was packed (too much), and the fans over our heads made me sneeze the whole dinner. We were not asked for our Covid pass. Quite frankly, I expected something more economical, considering the food quality. We got a 72$ bill (tip excluded) for:1 beet salad1 dish of ravioli alle noci1 glass of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo1 cup of earl grey tea1 decaf one shot"
5445,"Da Andrea is an intimate spot to grab some traditional Italian food, pasta, and accompanying drinks at an affordable price. Great spot for dinner with a few friends or a date!-- Food -- Da Andrea offers traditional Italian food -- lots of fresh pasta options.We started with the burrata which featured fresh, crisp, tomatoes -- exactly what you'd expect from a burrata. I ordered the artichoke ravioli and was not disappointed. The sauce was great and the artichoke mixture inside the pasta was unique and filling. My partner ordered the penne dish and loved it. Dietary: Plentiful vegetarian options. Limited gluten free options (lots of pasta). -- Drinks -- Da Andrea has a nice selection of cocktails and wines. My partner tried the Rosemary Spritz, a refreshingly light and herbal cocktail which was nice. I tried the special of the evening: a floral twist on a Negroni which I loved, despite not typically loving the taste of Campari. -- Service -- The waiters were very helpful and attentive. They even noticed my partner and I joking about who was going to ask for more bread and brought more without us saying anything. Lovely people! Reservations recommended. There was no wait for us with a reservation on a Thursday evening. -- Atmosphere --Da Andrea is a fairly large restaurant with two rooms inside, featuring about 10 tables each, and lots of outdoor seating. The indoor space is dimly lit and intimate. The outdoor space is absolutely covered in fresh flowers and in an covered shed space; very cute! -- COVID-19 Pandemic Precautions --Da Andrea is following NYC's current pandemic precautions. Staff members wearing masks and proof of vaccination required for indoor dining.-- Stars --Food: 3/3 StarsDrinks: 1/1 StarAtmosphere: 1/1 StarService: 1/1 StarTotal: 5/5 Stars"
5446,"Ambiance is very nice and romantic. The thing is that is not a legit Italian place. On the other hand, food presentation was very nice and I really enjoyed my meal. Staff is very attentive and friendly."
5447,"5 stars for the plush outdoor space. 2 stars for the food with exception to the Cacio Pepe that deserves zero stars Every other pasta I tried were delicious. Cacio e Pepe was  wtf kinda dish. No taste of cracked pepper. No trace of cheese. It was no salted. Just disgusting. Mussels were okay. The flat breads were okay. The lazy Mary or Bloody Mary was good but that depends on what vodka they use. Pancakes were awesome. Definitely not the best brunch places in town but when you need a reservation for 7, I'm happy to take what I get."
5448,"Decor heaven. My friends and I sat outside surrounded by beautiful florals. If there weren't so many cars passing by and honking, I can totally imagine myself sitting in Italy, sipping on wine and slurping the pasta. It's a beautiful restaurant, go and dine outside before it gets too cold! We started with the grilled squid salad and the burrata. The salad was delicious - the squid had the perfect texture that paired so well with the chopped cucumbers and corn. The lemon dressing balanced so well and made it so light. Definitely recommend trying that!For entrees, we tried - Spaghetti alla chitarra con ragu' bolognese - delicious flavors and perfect al dente spaghetti. They definitely did not skimp out on the meat. Ravioli di vitello (veal and spinach ravioli) - I usually hate ordering ravioli because it never fills me up, but this place makes it plump. The sauce was absolutely delicious, with bits of ham and mushrooms. Everything balanced so well. Spaghetti Alla Carbonara - perfectly cooked pasta, with the perfect creaminess. Braciola di maiale (pork chop over grilled apples and mushroom sauce) - the pork chop was huge and was so juicy and tender.We even got some extra bread to get all the sauce off the plates. Our server was amazing, she was attentive even though she had to run in and out the entire night. She even gave us complimentary biscotti. I can eat a whole bucket of that! Try this place out, you will not regret it."
5449,"Such a cute restaurant! One of my first outdoor dining experiences in NYC since we got here. Love all the florals and decor - makes me feel like I'm abroad in Italy! The carbonara was pretty good, super creamy and eggy just as you would expect for carbonara. We also got the bolognese which came with super fresh pasta! The flatbreads are pretty good as well as they tasted crispy yet very light.This restaurant is kinda pricey but great for an outdoor dining experience in nice weather!"
5450,"Super cute restaurant, perfect for a date night! Their outdoor seating is cozy, well heated on a cold winter night, and nice decorations which work great for pictures! The drinks were delicious! Caught us by surprise for sure, the 'Fragola Fizz' was really good! Interesting but surprisingly good mix of ingredients! Their wine list is also worthy of a try, I personally liked their Red Wine selection.We had a reservation, table was ready upon arrival and service was friendly and attentive"
5451,"Amazing Wine, beautiful scenery, and incredible food is all you will find at Da Andre restaurant off 13th st. The wine selection has something for everyone, while the staff is very knowledgeable on the selection. Tables are lit with a open candle and beautiful table setting. Services was absolutely  perfect, I couldn't ask them to change a thing. The food is what really did it for me, each  dish came alive with flavors! The Gnocchi was like eating small creamy pillows that melt in your mouth. I would recommend anything off this menu, some restaurant just do it right and you can't go wrong. Pro Tip: Get the mussels and make sure you have plenty of bread at the end to mop up the sauce baby! #tellemcraigsentyou"
5452,"My friend and I loved the atmosphere at Da Andrea. The wine was wonderful. The food was even better. The pasta was some of the best we have ever had. If you're looking for great Italian food, look no further. We enjoyed having the option to sit outside in the heated tent. We also loved all the flowers and lights that lined the outside of the restaurant. The only thing that could have improved was the communication from our waiter. We would ask for things and he would bring out the same thing or other things to tables around us, but seemingly forgot about us. He could have just been busy, it happens. If I am back in New York I would come here again or would recommend to a friend!"
5453,"This was such a beautiful restaurant, they did a great job with the outdoor seating. My younger brother and I decided to grab an early dinner from here. We didn't have reservations, but we were able to get a table. The service was amazing! Our waiter was extremely helpful and nice.For drinks we ended up getting the Capri, recommended by the waiter, and it was delicious. The lychee flavor was light but refreshing and was a great combo with the Prosecco  and cranberry juice.For the entrees my younger brother decided to get the gnocchi , the sauce was a bit bland and needed something. I ended up getting the risotto with scallops, which was okay. The scallops were perfectly cooked.  We also got a complimentary dessert, biscotti and some kind of custard, which was nice. This was a cool place, great drinks and atmosphere!"
5454,"Actually one of the best Italian places you'll be able to find around the city, great location, great food and amazing service and overall vibe. Def check it out if you haven't been before (and get the pesto salmon dish!!)"
5455,"This place was on my 'must-visit' list for a long time, and it definitely did not disappoint! Highly recommend to check this place out for their food and ambiance. The place gets very busy, very fast. So make sure you make reservations in advance for this place. We went in a party of 4 on a Wednesday evening at 6:30 PM (after making a reservation), and 90% of the restaurant was already full by then.Recommendations - ravioli, risotto (they have a risotto of the day- I had the risotto with prosciutto and peas) and tiramisu"
5456,"Booked a reservation here after seeing how nice the aesthetic was and the food looked good. Luckily it was exactly as expected! I ordered a Margherita pizza and among the table we shared many plates, everything was up to par and the tiramisu was phenomenal! Our waiter was very sweet and overall we had a great dinner here. Would definitely come back!"
5457,"My family and I had a reservation at Da Andrea for our first night visiting New York. We were greeted by the beautiful flowers and lights outside and fell in love with the elegant atmosphere. However, checking in with the host was a bit chaotic since the restaurant was busy. There were a lot of other patrons waiting and the host was feverishly running in and out of the door. Once we got his attention, we were seated within a matter of minutes though. The food was delicious and came out promptly. We ordered the grilled calamari as an appetizer, and then had the pappardelle, squid ink tagliolini, and cavatelli as our mains. The standout was definitely the pappardelle; it was made with truffle oil. Overall, a great dinner spot - I recommend making a reservation if you plan on going though."
5458,"Pretty awful. We sat outside immediately adjacent to multiple other tables and had to ask multiple times for our waitress - even for a basket of bread and side of olive oil. The outdoor ambience was nice but still pretty hot and humid without the fans turned on. It was tough to find our waitress since many staff were consistently rotating through the tables. The table next to us received their food approximately 30 minutes prior to ours even though they were seated much later than us. Normally I don't care about waiting for food in an outdoor New York City restaurant but this one, in particular, simply felt too chaotic in an environment where by the tables are very close to one another.Their menu is good but does not have much variety. I ordered the linguine with squid ink and vongole (clams) that tasted good but was not extremely filling. Also ordered the grilled vegetables which looked very pretty but contained mostly onion and goat cheese without much variety. The risotto with eggplant tasted good but little egg plant was found except for at the very center of the dish.I don't mean to appear sassy with this review but simply put, there are far too many Italian restaurants in New York City making the competition quite fierce. As it stands, we have no plans to return to this restaurant."
5459,"Good is good and delicious but be prepared to be hungry haha unless you get one of the meat options . everything is fairly priced especially for a Italian restaurant!!! Would definitely try again ,when I'm new York"
5460,"I had my birthday dinner here and loved the ambiance. The beautiful summer setup included a pink floral canopy over the outdoor tables (see pics). Service was great and the food was solid. I was not in the mood for pasta, so I ordered the lamb shank with saffron risotto - it was delicious. The staff was kind to sing happy birthday when they brought out my dessert. Overall, enjoyable experience here. Do make a reservation!"
5461,"Great service, ambiance, and food! Seda gives fabulous recommendations and is a sweetheart. Pesto is 10/10 and chocolate walnut cake is AMAZINg"
5462,"Located at 35 West 13th street.   A Cozy festive feeling greets you as you walk in the door.  The menu was extensive.   The pasta we ordered was fresh and cooked perfectly.  Service was excellent and attentive.   There is outside seating but we chose to eat inside.  Tables are close together so if that concerns you, try outside which looked lovely as well.  Definitely recommend!"
5463,Came here for lunch The outside decor is beautiful reminds me of the Mediterranean Service was fantastic everyone was friendly and attentive especially with my toddler who was in a moodDrinks were good but expensive The food was good too I would like to try other dishes next time I had the risotto and a pear salad. I like the pear salad more than the risotto. The apple tart was okay not memorable. There's indoor and outdoor seating There's a parking lot next door Prices are a bit highDefinitely would come back for the service and the decor outside.
5464,"This was our first time in New York,  and we are such foodies. We saw some cute pictures of this place so we decided to try it out. We were not disappointed the drinks where so delicious and beautiful. We also had the ravioli and papadelle pasta and could tell it was freshly made you can also definitely taste the truffle in the pasta which we loved. Our server Carlos and his assistant where great too! Overall amazing experience. Thanks Da Andrea"
5465,Food: The ricotta ravioli and tiramisu were absolutely amazing - highly recommend. The pesto cavatelli was not great but they were nice enough to switch it with another ravioli dish. The tiramisu was also really good.Atmosphere: It's a really cute and cozy spot. Perfect for an intimate dinner.
5466,Passed by this cute little restaurant on our way to Bansky exhibition which is right around the corner. It is a perfect little date night spot. The food was good and our waitress was friendly and attentive. Crème brûlée was phenomenal! One of the best I've ever had.
5467,"Loved the resto, the flower and light designt, vibe was very delightful. We got carbonara and steak. Carbonara was tasty but was very disappointed with my steak, asked for tenderloin medium done but received a rare done tenderloin -see the pic posted."
5468,"Came here during brunch for my friend's birthday this past Saturday. Ambience: We sat in the enclosed heated outdoor space where it's covered in pretty flowers and plants. There was also live music inside, but there was a speaker in the outdoor space so we were also able to hear it. Food:We started off with complimentary Focaccia and a Margarita Flatbread. Both were good. I ordered the Pennette Con Salmone which was basically a well made Penne alla Vodka with the addition of smoked salmon which worked really well and gave a brunch flair. I would order this again. My friends ordered the Fettuccine Al Tartufo, Pappardelle, Chitarra alla Carbonara, and the Benedict Aragosta which I had a sample of. All of them were solid dishes, but I would say the Fettuccine Al Tartufo stood out to me alongside the one I ordered.Misc:There is a fee if you are planning to bring and have cake and the brunch cocktails are available, but they are not on the physical menus only online."
5469,"Whimsical outdoor space, so beautiful with flowers and lights.Service is impeccable, attentive and friendly.Delicious bread with the most perfect olive oil and olives.I ordered the squid Ink pasta with clams which was so fresh and light and delicious. I love that they offer half portions of pasta should u want to try more than 1.The apple tart was amazing...They also gave complimentary almond biscuits with a little dipping cream that was superb.I cant wait to go back to that restaurant"
5470,"BEST pasta I've had in the city so far. Da Andrea's food had incredibly balanced flavors, was not heavy on salt or oil, and was the perfect portion (not tiny and overpriced, but still will get you nice and full!) my main takeaways:- Cocktails and wine were excellent and fairly priced. I personally enjoyed the Capri cocktail with my brunch- Outdoor seating IS heated, though a bit unlevel- Our favorite pastas were the mushroom with truffle cream fettuccine, and the smoked salmon penne- The bread and olive oil before our meal were both amazing -- my favorite so far of all Italian restaurants I've had in the city- Excellent service"
5471,"Beautiful restaurant and amazing food! For drinks, we ordered Capri (refreshing and delish). For appetizers, we ordered the calamaretti alla griglia (grilled calamari) and burrata con basilico. The cavatelli di ricotta was so delicious and portion sizes were great. There were chunks of salmon and shrimp. Highly recommend this spot for a girl's night or date night"
5472,"Cozy interior, great service and delicious food! I tried the burrata, risotto special and tiramisu. Everything was amazing and the tiramisu was to die for! I'd go back there just for the dessert! I recommend booking a table as they were packed on a Friday night."
5473,"Amazing food and service! I called to make a reservation on a very nice day so I couldn't make a reservation for 6PM. Ended up selecting 5:30PM time slot. I got the Ravioli Di Noci, and it was one of the best raviolis I've ever had! The service was great, and I would 100% recommend to anyone considering going."
5474,"If you like Italian, this is the place to go. Very cozy and homey, with excellent selection of pastas. I ordered spaghetti carbonara and it was cooked exactly as it's supposed to be and the portion was decent. I could honestly eat here twice a day, it's that good. Our server was great and we had an amazing time. Definitely recommend!"
5475,"Cute decor Mussels - great appetizer with flavorful sauce, paired well with the focaccia bread. Good amount of mussels Papardelle - freshly made pasta with ragu and  tomato sauce. Favorite item here especially with the fresh cheese and peppersSquid ink tagliolini, clams, cherry tomatoes, garlic white wine - the pasta flavor was a bit bland even with the garlic white wine. Clams were goodTiramisu - not as flavorful as I would have expected. Decent amount of cake"
5476,"I ordered the Ricotta a Noci and it was so good! the seevice was so lovely, I had a nut allergy and they made the dish without walnuts :) Overall the ambiance was beautiful, def a moment for pictures if that's your vibe."
5477,The ambiance outside is quite nice but this place does great crowded. If you're looking to have a conversation with your meal this place may not be it for you as it does get loud. The food was good but the cocktails weren't very strong.  Servers very attentive!
5478,"We came to this restaurant a few days ago and it was a mixed experience. The outside and inside of the restaurant are beautifully decorated. The staff was very nice and welcoming. Our server was so nice, attentive and knowledgeable of the menu. I always order Linguine al Vongele when I go to an Italian restaurant, but I wish I didn't when I came here. The clams were sandy (they might've not been cleaned and prepared properly?) and the pasta did not have much flavor. The portion was a good size but  would not recommend this plate. Others in my party ordered the pork chop, which they enjoyed. Big portion and very good taste. Someone else ordered the seafood soup and they also enjoyed it. We also ordered the tiramisu and it was pretty good. Food- 3.5 starsStaff/ service- 4 stars"
5479,Came here to celebrate my friends' birthday. The pastas are delicious!! Definitely try the smoked salmon pasta. Marco was very friendly and we'll definitely come back.
5480,I'm glad they opened another location in the UWS with more space than the original.  Fresh cookies available around the clock.  My fave is the walnut chocolate chip.
5481,"4.5 / 5.0 - The original location just 2 blocks down is tiny and used to have huge lines when it was open pre-Covid, especially over the weekends.This shop is newer and much more spacious, with nice displays. The staff is very friendly, too.COOKIESThe cookies are huge and I love how they're freshly baked and the chocolate chips melt in your mouth. If you can't eat it right away, I'd recommend heating it up.I've had all of their cookies and would recommend:- Chocolate Chip Walnut Cookie - This is the original and is a good, solid cookie.- Two Chip Chocolate Chip Cookie - I'm not a huge fan of nuts in cookies, so I was thrilled when they added this to their selection.- Dark Chocolate Chocolate Chip - A must try for chocolate lovers, with a delicious combination of the crispy outside and cake-like chewy chocolate dough inside.I prefer the simpler cookies, but if you like peanut butter or oatmeal, they were good, too.I've also tried the frozen Two Chip Chocolate Chip Cookie they sell at grocery stores, but they're much smaller in comparison, so it just isn't the same experience.OTHER PASTRIESThis morning, I stopped by to pick up some pastries for breakfast:- Banana Chocolate Chip Bread ($3.75 per slice)- Oatmeal Raisin Scone ($3.25)The Banana Chocolate Chip Bread was huge and on the sweeter side, with a ton of chocolate chips inside.The Oatmeal Raisin Scone was baked perfectly, with a crispy outside and a soft and fluffy inside. I would love it if they could make more flavors."
5482,Mmmmm. This is the perfect cookie when it's nice and warm. You get your bang for your buck. And at 4 dollars a cookie this was worth every gooey bite. If you have a big sweet tooth you must come here! I prefer the dark chocolate since it's so thick and rich and sweet compared to the regular chocolate chip. Both were good though. Well worth every penny. But don't take my advice alone. My friend gave it a 9/10 on the cookie scale and a 6.5/10 if when it's cold. If you're saving some for later I recommend you microwave or toast it before digging in.
5483,This is my second time trying a Levain cookie. The regular chocolate chip cookie was definitely the winner here for me. The chocolate chip walnut comes in second.The exterior is crunchy and the interior is chewy with a ton of chocolate chips dispersed well throughout.
5484,"Okay. This is tricky. I know most people who are reading this are likely Levain fans. I am too! Don't get me wrong. It's just that the only edible cookie in my opinion is the Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate Chip because it's the least sweet. Unless you have a huge sweet tooth go for the PB-Dark. You're welcome.BTW: They are addictive. These are for soft cookie lovers.If you are looking for a crispy/crunchy cookie, go elsewhere."
5485,"When folks knew we were coming to NYC for on a visit, one of the first questions was are you going to Levain's?   We'd come several years back when they were at the original location.  We weren't going to make a special trip but as it turned out we were on the upper west side and we were going to walk right by on Amsterdam.  We popped in yesterday on a cold rainy day. No line.  Then on the way out 12 people in line.  We got the chocolate chip walnut  and the two chocolate chip still warm. We didn't eat them until a few hours later.  Still good. The chocolate chips were oozing out.  We're in town for a few more days.  Maybe we'll swing by again."
5486,"For most, I can see how this is ~the~ ideal chocolate chip cookie. Its very chunky, melty+  chocolatey, and crispy to the crunch. Personally, I'm not the biggest fan of chunky cookies, but it was still good for the experience! Its great when it comes out gooey, warm, and fresh. There's also cute postcards you can take as well and as always staff is very friendly and quick."
5487,"Am an athlete and never met a carb I didn't like - these are the best!! Like this bigger location, especially during COVID, since it's not crammed inside - tho I miss the og location. I love the new / special flavors. Two chip chocolate chip (milk and dark chocolate) w no walnuts - and Dulce de Leche w sea salt (bring this back!!). Always grab 2 and sit, doing the happy dance w my partner splitting whatever we got. Our other faves are the chocolate chocolate chip and peanut butter chocolate chip cookies. Muffin top big, crunchy edges and chewy and melty goodness inside.  Especially love the story - two former Columbia swimmers came up w it whilst training for an Ironman. Am pretty sure it's not what is meant by carbo loading, but I'll take it!"
5488,I love this place they just need to have cookies with less sugar (I find the cookies too sweet) and an oatmeal dark chocolate chip cookie.
5489,"First time a the new location, a lot bigger their little basement spot, I tired to go the old one but the entrance is all bordered up. No line, got my cookies and got out. Still as good as always, I always like to make the effort to hit this spot up when in town. Their frozen cookies they have began selling nationwide are terrible and do not represent the cookies at Levain's."
5490,"Lowering my rating to 4 stars because these cookies are only amazing when they are warm and fresh. Once they've sat out for a while, they lose their amazing gooey texture and chocolatey goodness and become a very average cookie at best."
5491,"Best cookies ever, period. They are ooey and gooey and perfect. The peanutbutter chocolate chip is fantastic, but you can't go wrong with any of them."
5492,"Wow! Brand new spacious spot, but still with tremendous lines! I have been a regular of Levain for years and had not yet visited this newer location. It is really spacious, clean, and modern inside. Even during COVID pandemic, there are very long lines, but the staff does a good job of keeping it organized and spaced out, and serving customers as quickly as possible. They are open relatively late, which is great for after dinner coffee/cookies as well. The freshness of the cookies I found is still good in the evening time. For non-New Yorkers. You MUST try a Levain cookie. The cookies will certainly stretch your definition of what a cookie is!! They are incredibly tasty, loaded with goodies (and sugar!). I have often taken these on a plane with me to give to family, and have found them to still stay fresh for days and taste extremely good even a few days later (with a few seconds in the microwave). $4 for a single 'cookie' might seem steep, but you can certainly share this with another person. Definitely worth a stop!"
5493,"I mean, the cookies are...okay, I guess.But lines for days and like $4.50 for a cookie?You guys know another cookie place is like two blocks away, and it's cheaper, quicker and better?Nothing against Leavain: they seem to be nice people with a high level of service. And I LOVE me a good chocolate chip cookie.But I've had better. That is all."
5494,"It was so nice to stop by this oldie but goodie for a sense of normalcy! The shop took great precautions and I felt quite safe through the medical grade masks, plexiglass barriers, hand sanitizers, and socially distanced lines. And the cookies look as amazing as always. They have a new flavor available, two chip, although the verdict from the hubs is that their original chocolate chip walnut is still numero uno. While Levain's is not celiac safe, this was my FAVORITE celebration / long week / breakup / promotion therapy spot. And while I can't have cookies here now (their gluten-free is baked in the same facility with the gluten-full cookies... I'm still keeping my fingers crossed that this might change at some point), it was really nice to come by and pick up cookies for the hubs!"
5495,"On a Friday at around 10:30am, there was no line at all--I walked right in and placed my order with a friendly staffer. I got the chocolate chip walnut and oatmeal raisin cookies, one of each. For one cookie, it's $4.50, which is pricey without a doubt; however, the cookies are massive, delicious, and I was able to have parts of them not only the next day but two days after purchase and they maintained a good amount of moisture. Especially considering that Levain is a spot you most likely stop at for a treat, I would say the price is worth it."
5496,"There's a reason this place is so highly rated and there are long lines all the time. My friends keep grabbing me a variety pack whenever they come by, and I will say my number one flavor is the chocolate chip peanut butter. My second is the chocolate chip. The oatmeal raisin was OK, but didn't taste like the oatmeal raisin cookies I'm used to and I'll admit I'm not a fan of nuts in my dessert, so could have done without the chocolate chip walnut cookies."
5497,"It's been a few years since I devoured my prior Levain cookie, and after visiting and spending a buttload on cookies, I really don't know why (or how) I stayed away - what a dummy! On this most recent visit, I decided to get myself four (yes FOUR) cookies - Dark Chocolate Chocolate Chip; Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter, Two Chip Chocolate Chip, and Chocolate Chip Walnut.  [I didn't get the Oatmeal raisin, because I hate raisins.]     Each cookie was the massive beast that I remember it being, nice and almost crispy on the outside and oh so soft and gooey on the inside - it's exactly what cookie dreams are made of.  And even though this Levain beast is $4 - like really it's ONLY $4 - it's worth it.  I know you can buy a box of Chips Ahoy for about the same price, and and normal Insomnia cookie runs about $2, but the Levain are massive and quality is just above the rest.  Because I bought so many cookies it took me a couple days to get through it all, and it was good until the last bite for real.  My favorite was the classic Chocolate Chip Walnut, but all of them could give any other cookie competitor a run for their money. To be fair, I've never tried anything else other than cookies as Levain, and honestly I don't know if I ever will, but the cookies will keep me coming back again and again."
5498,"I mean, it's levain. The king of all cookies... gooey on this inside and crispy on the outside. Buttery, made into perfection. Their other baked goods are so so though. - Had the pumpkin slice, which tastes like a pumpkin pie. That's how it should be done. Pumpkin bread sometimes taste like straight up pumpkin. This one was very flavorful with nutmeg, clove, cinnamon, and ginger. - banana chocolate chip is so so moist and chocolaty. If you can make their famous chocolate chip cookie into a bread, this is it. Gooey and heavenly on the inside but crispy on the outside - coffee crumb cake was just okay. They had a tiny bit of cinnamon blast on the bottom of the slice. Eh. Not much to write about because it was pretty underwhelming. Overall, get the cookies because other sweets (and bread) are just okay, unless it's banana bread. To the king of cookies, 9 Gryffindor points out of 10!"
5499,"Sell an organ, your soul and your mom, do whatever you have to do to have THIS cookie; you won't regret it. If you do- you're a basic bitch. Cookies: 5 Foodboner: immediatelyQuality: 5Portion to $: worth itService: standardWait at 8am: zero Basic bitches in line: 1, ergo 100%It's a massive cookie, but you knew that already. Is it worth $4? Fuck no. You can make your own. But you won't. Because you don't know how. And you're lazy. So, just spend the rent check on it. Fuck it. YOLO. If you love chocolate chip cookies, this is the ultimate. The Mecca. The thrilla in Manila. The Tom Brady of cookies. It's better than sex. No, that's a lie. Nothing is better than sex. Fuck the diabetes & other health risks. You deserve this. You could get hit by a falling AC unit tomorrow and die ! This is how you eat this cookie: slowly. Initially, you think you want to fuck it fast and finish immediately. But you grown now, Ringo. Make love to this cookie like she's out of your league. Take your time and savor every bite. Wash it down with whole milk, between bites. This is not the time for almond milk, i don't care what happens after- live in the moment. Risk anything and everything to maximize full enjoyment.Don't wait until you get home, or back in the office. Eat this...now. It's warm, moist and waiting for you to eat her; time is irrelevant. Your entire life should be devoted to this cookie right after your credit card gets denied and you're paying with the cash designated for rent. This is the Mt. Everest of cookies. Except, perhaps, your mom's cookie?"
5500,"Do yourself a favor and order the chocolate chip walnut cookie! It's the perfect marriage between cookie, cake, chocolate and nuts. The chocolate chip walnut cookie is about two inches thick, making it one of the juiciest cookies I've ever had. However, it isn't overwhelmingly sweet or overly decadent. The flavors are balanced *just* right to facilitate a delightful cookie experience. For around $5 you can experience one of the best cookies in New York! A word of caution: if you have a significant other or child who wants a bite, you'll probably be better off buying them their own so you don't have to share! ;)"
5501,"Wow, so sweet and chewy - just like how I like them! I finally decided to make a stop here after hearing all the rave reviews about this place. As you enter. you smell the butter and chocolate. I got their dark chocolate and oatmeal raisin. They were both good but I prefer the dark chocolate more. To be honest, I thought the cookies were a bit too hyped - like they're bomb but you can definitely make something similar at home, so yes, i was a bit disappointed. The cookies are $4.50 each so definitely not cheap - but it's quite thick. Would I come back though? Yes."
5502,"We came by here to try their famous chocolate chip cookies, and picked up both the chocolate chip walnut cookie and the double chocolate chip cookie. They were amazing! The cookie is a decent size, and packed full of flavor (either lots of chocolate, or chocolate and walnuts). They're a perfect balance between soft with a crunchier exterior. It's a bakery worth visiting!"
5503,Favorite cookies ever! I love dessert but have not really been a particular fan of cookies until I tried these! The hype is definitely worth it. The cookies are pricey but to be honest each cookie is pretty large and even as a dessert lover impossible to finish in one sitting. Must try!
5504,"This is the new larger location on the UWS as the older OG location is temporarily closed.  They have the tried and true classics along with some newer items like an Oatmeal Raisin scone which is buttery, fluffy and a lighter treat vs the cookies. The customers were all very respective of social distancing and we got our cookies fresh from the oven too which was a nice plus!"
5505,"Let me preface this by saying that I am a Levain groupie. I even dream about Levain cookies sometimes. I've been to 3 Levain Bakery locations (and ordered delivery from a 3rd), and they're all amazing. This is one of the nicer ones-- it's not the original, but it's close to Central Park and it's a must-visit if you're going to one of the museums on the west side (e.g. The Natural History Museum). They have delicious pastries in addition to their world-famous cookies, but I haven't met anything I like more than the OG chocolate chip walnut cookie. Their dark chocolate cookies are good as well. If you're worried about the line: It's long, but it goes by quickly and it's worth the wait. The workers there are incredibly efficient and good with their time. Their service is impeccable and their job is to get you out of there as fast as possible. About the price: Sure, it's expensive, but you're not eating the whole thing in one go, so it's worth it! If you're not going to eat it for a while, freeze it when you get home and microwave it later on. It still tastes incredible. Pro-tip: If you like salty & sweet flavors, I like adding a little bit of kosher salt to my cookie at home. Personal preference. :)"
5506,"No other cookie will satisfy my cookie craving again. Levain bakery has perfected the chocolate chip cookie, and every other flavor cookie they have there as well. So indulgent, soft yet chewy, and with the perfect amount of chips. Get yourself to one of their locations ASAP !"
5507,"The hype is REAL!I ordered via caviar to pick up and it was ready by the time I got there. I was late and the person even called me to make sure I was coming because it was close to their closing time.I got the four assorted cookies- Chocolate Chip walnut, Dark Chocolate peanut butter, oatmeal raisin and Dark Chocolate Chip. If you are a peanut butter fan like me, you will LOVE the dark chocolate peanut butter- it was my favorite! My least favorite was Oatmeal raisin just because I am not a big oatmeal raisin fan!I will definitely go back to try their bread and other items on the menu."
5508,"So sad the other location in UWS closed but this location will do! Honestly, hands down the BEST cookie ever in NYC. When you walk in, you can smell the fresh cookies and when they serve it to you, it's nice and warm. Levain does not disappoint!!"
5509,"My friends and I craved a ""real cookie"" after downing some margaritas. Honestly, their cookies are really up to preference. For me personally they are just too sweet. But they are huge and fun. But if you don't like overly sugar packed cookies they are not for you."
5510,"I've been to Levain's smaller, now closed location but not this one. In the Age of the Rona I probably won't get to see this location any time soon. But don't let that stop you! Even though Levain's listing says no deliveries, Caviar is providing the service at no additional cost. The cookies are massive. Not like a big, flat, wide cookie. Those are always disappointing and dry. These are compact mounds. They're like a hybrid between a cookie and a muffin top. Crunchy on the outside, soft and moist in the middle. I could only manage half a cookie at a time, so my four cookies lasted a whole week. The oatmeal raisin was my absolute favorite. It's a whole breakfast with a cup of coffee. It's also the one most like a muffin top. Hearty and delicious. Also the least sweet of the four. Still plenty sweet though. Next came the Chocolate Peanut Butter Chip and the Chocolate Chocolate Chip. These were the two I had to go halfsies on. They are DENSE. Don't be a hero. Go half and live another day. Lastly was the regular Chocolate Chip. There's nothing wrong with it but the other three showed it up. I know part of the Levain experience is standing in line but the free delivery is going to spoil a lot of people for it in the future. ::movie trailer voice:: The world... is changing."
5511,"Why wait at the original location (almost literally around the corner) when you can your cookies faster here and not feel as cluttered! Don't get me wrong, still a line, but from experience, much faster. (I had taken my friends to the original bakery on 74th and those who didn't want to wait, I walked them to this location. Even after the walk and waiting in line, still got out faster than my friends who waited at 74th.) Disclaimer: I have not tried the other baked goods at this location, but the cookies are definitely the thing to get here.Cookie selection includes:-Oatmeal Raisin (my favorite)-Chocolate chip walnut -Dark Chocolate Chocolate chip-Dark Chocolate peanut butter ship (2nd go to, but it can get a little much, so I usually save the rest for later)The cookies at this location still taste amazing and consistent to the other location. Although my favorite go to is the oatmeal raisin, all their cookies are amazing! I love the hard outside, but gooey soft inside. Although these cookies do have a hefty price point, the cookie is very massive and well worth it!Tips:-If you are a visitor and want to bring cookies back, here are some helpful tips:1) Bring parchment paper and ziplock bags (you can ask for extra individual bags, but since it is packed with butter, you may not want to risk it seeping through into your luggage, but you can still wrap 1 cookie per bag then place it in your ziplock). Wrap the cookies individually tight!**this tip was actually recommended by one of the workers**2) If you did not wrap the cookies tight, you may experience the cookie getting too hard. I tend to recommend to my friends to microwave it for a little (15-30 sec) to get it soft again in the inside and get the chocolate to melt like it would if you had it fresh."
5512,"I must sayThis place HAS a special place in my heart... Not exactly this location but THE ENTIRETY OF LEVAIN.. My sister has introduced me to Levain, and I finally got to introduce my best friend who was visiting from Florida to Levain bakery.. Sunday July 18th.... We shared a chocolate chip cookie with walnuts... once again y'all definitely delivered THE RICHNESS, the fragrance, the texture. Everything about that one cookie we shared was just magically... it was amazing . Seriously please support LEVAIN forever.."
5513,"i'm visiting new york and have been wanting to come here to get cookies ! these cookies are AMAZING ! they are one of the best chocolate chip cookies i have ever had. the outside was a little crispy, while the inside was gooey, but it was not too gooey where it felt undercooked. also, the chocolate chip cookies were a perfect sweetness."
5514,"I stopped here to get some cookies - I think that's probably what they're known best for. I waited in line outside for a little bit because they were only letting a few people at a time into the store. Their cookies are great, as usual, but they taste best microwaved! I'd come back here again if I am in town."
5515,"Come for the cookies once, and you will definitely want to return! This place is famous for a reason. Their cookies are delicious and unlike other bakeries in the city--they are brownie-like and soft in the center with a slightly crisp exterior. Each cookie is big enough that I often break it in half and eat in two servings, but no judgments if you finish yours more quickly!The chocolate with peanut butter chips is my favorite and is awesome. Their brioche buns are also very tasty.There is sometimes a line outside, but it tends to move fairly quickly. They are organized and get you your cookies fairly fast!"
5516,You can't possibly walk in here without trying a cookie. The dark chocolate peanut butter cookie is ridiculous. These cookies are a full meal pretty much! So good! You will have to add 30 minutes to your workout if you have one of these. Trust me it is worth it. They also have muffins and coffee. I don't think you can go wrong with anything. Just close your eyes and pick!  This stuff isn't cheap so beware of that but who cares it is so good. They are worth every penny. 5 stars all the way!
5517,"Yes, it's $4 for a cookie but it's so worth it! Made my first visit last week. We got 2 dark chocolate chip cookies and a coffee. The coffee was average and I wish they let me pour my own cream. The cookies were amazing! It was warm and so satisfying to break apart, seeing the gooey center. Ended up getting in line again and buying an additional two cookies. Tip:Buy your cookies and go walk Central Park while eating your baked goods. The Best!"
5518,"The cookie gods have heard my cry.I went to the original bakery years ago and as much as I loved the cookie, I wished they had a pure chocolate chip cookie with no walnuts (because really, them nuts are just taking up the space where chocolate chips could be).  I'm not sure how recent they released this but there is now a pure chocolate chip cookie available and...O.M.G.I am in love. I can delete my Hinge. It is cookie perfection. It's a huge cookie, but soft and not too sweet. But rich and gooey as well. If you are into gooey cookies (crispy lovers too), you need to try this NY icon!(No pictures because predictably, I scarfed this down before I took a shot. Sorry)"
5519,Levain has the best chocolate chip cookies around! They are absolutely addicting. The staff are always friendly and great at offering suggestions if you aren't sure what to get or if it's your first time. Mobile ordering is available so you can skip the line and avoid long waits during a rush. I find it to be quick and easy when ordering in the early morning. I love to indulge in a warm slice of their chocolate chip banana bread. The servings are huge and so good. You really can't go wrong with any choice you make here. Levain is a must try when visiting the Westside. I'll be back soon. Save me a cookie ;)
5520,Excellent!  The brisket tacos and guacamole were delicious! Highly recommend for your next visit to NYC!
5521,"Tacos, nachos and margaritas amazing.... Wouldn't recommend the enchiladas.... They were not as good as the other food....."
5522,"Cute theater district Mexican place - friendly staff. The space is small, and they fit everyone in comfortably. The have two outside spaces - one open and one looked like private rooms. Inside there is high ceiling so the space feels bigger than it is, there is an upstairs loft (if you have someone who isn't good with stairs make sure to mention this when you make your reservation.)We did a sampling sharing approach to dinner and we're very happy:Fresh guacamole - medium heat (you pick the heat you want). Perfect. You could taste the freshness. Tuna ceviche. Comes in tiny tacos which surprised me and was equally cute and tasty. Shrimp (soft) tacos. I could not get enough of. So happy we picked this one out of all the choices. Tres leches cake with fresh strawberries for dessert. Prickly pear margarita was wonderful, not too sweet. I would get everything again."
5523,"Toloache has the some of the BEST desserts in NYC! Their dinner portions are small, but if you're like me (I don't like to feel stuffed and I need to save room for dessert), this place is perfect. There are lots of unique ""add-ons"" to their small plates if you have a bigger appetite. My daughter and I shared an order of their fried avocado, along with an order of fish tacos and lobster tacos. We were a bit disappointed that our main dishes did not come with rice and beans- a small portion of each used to accompany the tacos, but now you have to order your sides as extras. I suppose this is due to the pandemic and the rising cost of ingredients, as it seems to be happening everywhere. Normally, I would have reduced my review by one star, but.... THE DESSERTS made us forget about anything negative. If I could give Toloache 10 stars, I would! We had tres leches de limone, along with a decadent Toloache crunch cake, topped with chocolate pop rocks, & described as ""having a party in your mouth"" by our waiter. WOW! They were so good that we considered ordering a second round of desserts ""to go!"" As a side note- I highly recommend making reservations, either before 5 pm, or after 8 pm. We had a 6:45 reservation on a Saturday and didn't get seated until 7:15. Located directly next to ""Wicked"" and surrounded by many other shows on Broadway, this reservation time was not an ideal choice. (I'm just trying to give any future guests thorough information.) As you can see, I still think they deserve 5 stars! Once seated, we were promptly greeted by a friendly waiter. Food arrived quickly. And those desserts- pure perfection!! Can't wait to go back!"
5524,"The thing about being a native New Yorker is that there are so many wonderful restaurants.  We all have our favorites, we all have our go-tos.  Once COVID waged war on my fellow humans and the restaurant industry, I decided to be more mindful when selecting places to eat when seeing a musical on Broadway.  Toloache on 50th is located across the street from a subway entrance and a short walk away from 8th avenue.  To enter, you walk through an enclosed eating area where we saw a few tables for 2 set up and one couple were already dining.  A large group of 20-somethings walked in ahead of us and were turned away because they hadn't made a reservation (note:  MAKE A RESERVATION AT ANY RESTAURANT NEAR THEATERS OR IN NYC ON A WEEKEND!).  Luckily, I planned ahead and had reserved a table for 2 weeks in advance.Our IDs and COVID vaccine cards were checked after they located my name (still a mandate in NYC-not the policy of the restaurant) and they quickly led us up two sets of stairs to the seating area in a loft section of the restaurant.  Each wall had booth seating and across the table were chairs.  The minute we sat down we were given menus and someone came over to fill our water (we were asked if we wanted sparkling, bottled or tap).  Our server immediately followed and told us he would come back for drink orders, but made sure to point out the special cocktails for the day and the appetizer/entree specials.The Grows:  We were seated quickly, but then someone came over and said they needed to move us because a bigger party was coming and they had to group the tables.  We had already sipped water and touched the table settings and gotten ourselves out of heavy winter garb.  Not a huge deal, but we were two really easy-going people--this wouldn't go over well with some customers.  Tables were very close together, like pre-COVID dining.  For me, this is typical NYC dining layout.  For the people sitting next to us, it was too close for comfort.  The Glows:  The fish tacos were crispy, the tortilla was warmed adequately, the jicama slaw had bold flavors, and the pumpkin truffle creamy rice was superb.  We ordered the chocolate cake (which came with Pop Rocks!), the dulce de leche limon cake and lattes for dessert.  The coffee was strong and on point.  The desserts were generous and outstanding.  At no point did we feel rushed.  Our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.  As we walked out the door, the man and woman at the host station wished us a good evening.  Classy place, moderate pricing, delicious food, and convenient location when attending the theater."
5525,"Was so lucky to snag a res here before watching Hadestown. Came at 6:30pm on a Friday and this place was packed - heard the hostess tell a couple that the wait would be 1 hour. The seats in this restaurant are so so close to each other so they can't even add more capacity.Service is quite fast, with someone asking if you want to order drinks, apps, etc. within a minute or so of being seated. My friend and I got guac to share and I got some birria tacos. Both were amazzinggg! Will talk about them in more detail below, but want to caveat that it is quite pricey - my $18(?) tacos came with 2 tacos lol.Birria tacos- so so good. Shell is crisp and soaked in flavor. Meat is so soft and saucy. Has onions, guac and everything you'd want. Comes with a soup / sauce, which was awesome when I dipped my taco into these.Guacs and chips - chips were amazing even eaten alone. Came with salsa which was rich and a really good counterpart to the guac. Guac was well seasoned and very fresh. Amazing!!Overall a great meal - will def be coming back before any broadway shows."
5526,Can't believe I've never reviewed this place...I've been here so many times over the years.   Toloache is a reliable place for food and drinks near the Theater District.  Their margaritas are really delicious.  Service is always very nice.   It can get loud and crowded inside but outside isn't too bad when the weather is nice.I always get guac and usually get queso fundido.  Both of those are delicious!   I usually get a meat or shrimp dish for an entree and I can't complain about anything.    The food is good but maybe not so memorable that I can remember anything standing out.The best thing I can say is that I've never had a bad meal here and always enjoyed my visits.
5527,"Pretty much 3.5 stars. Came in for brunch and everything was good, just not great. I had a grapefruit mezcalita to start, which was an appropriate level of boozy. The toro taquitos were nice, not very flavorful. The crunch corn shell overpowered the tuna so I found myself breaking the shell in half to just eat it open face style. We shared the enchiladas Borrachos and the birria tacos. I enjoyed the enchiladas but my boyfriend preferred the tacos. The enchiladas was a sizable portion for $24, stuffed with pulled chicken and I enjoyed the tangy salsa with which they were smothered. The birria tacos were flavorful and the consume was delicious, but idk they left something to be desired for me. For $18 you only get two tacos which feels steep. I wasn't blown away but probably be back to try some other dishes. Still on the hunt for my favorite Mexican restaurant in the city. Better options in the outer boroughs for now."
5528,"This is a popular restaurant near the theater area. Definitely make reservation in advanced. When i got there, there was a line waiting outside. I was glad that we reserved a table. We picked this place for a quick bite before the broadway show. They have a full bar. I would like to try some drinks next time. We only ordered short rib taco and chicken enchiladas. Food is great. The taco is just regular portion, two pieces with some beef. The beef is really good, portion wise i don't think it's enough for dinner even for female. Service is good. We got in and out in less than 1 hour. I will recommend this place for pre-show or after show hang out."
5529,Delicious food and drinks. The lobster tacos were to die for!!!   The drinks were great. Just wish they were bigger
5530,"I came here for a company dinner and was pleasantly surprised! For drinks, I tried the Mango De La Casa Margarita and the La Sandia Margarita, which is a watermelon flavor one. Both were yummy, but I definitely liked the mango one more. We got the Trio de Guacamoles for the table which was very yummy. They had a few unique quacs (one with pomegranates), but all very good. For tacos, I tried the Suadero ones which were probably one of the best tacos I've had in NY. The meat was so tender and the flavor combinations worked very well together. For dessert, we tried their churros which were nice and crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside. The dulce de leche sauce was delcicious. Definitely, a fun vibe and I really enjoyed this place :)"
5531,"We came here for a quick bite before an off-Broadway show. It was busy on a Saturday night but there was plenty of room at the bar. They were playing fun top 40, Latin, and dance music. This restaurant has a great selection of tequila and mezcal-based drinks, as well as sangria. I ordered the Toloache margarita. It was very fruity with hibiscus and blueberries. It didn't taste like a traditional margarita at all, but it was flavorful. I wish I'd had more time to savor it. My sister got the mezcalita de pina and said it was tasty, but not very spicy. The flavored salt around the rim combined really well with the drink. To eat, we shared the guacamole. We asked for it to be made spicy, but it was quite mild. The portion size was also a bit small for the price. Nevertheless, it was super fresh with satisfying chunks of avocado. It came with a chipotle salsa which had a nice kick and was great for mixing into the guacamole.The food arrived very quickly which we appreciated as we were in a rush. The bartenders were nice. I'd love to come back to try the rest of their menu."
5532,"Toloache is a great option if you're not particularly hungry. We ordered the shrimp quesadilla and the Pollo Toloache, and while both dishes were very tasty, the portions were small. The quesadilla feels like an appetizer, and the Pollo Toloache is an entree for a not-so-hungry diner. The former has a little spice to it, which added to the tastiness. The latter felt refreshing, in large part due to the corn and salsa. To be fair, the service was very good, and the indoor area is very pleasant."
5533,"A shoutout to this reliable Mexican spot in west side Manhattan that caters to all clientele from working professionals to tourists and theater patrons. The atmosphere, while not as chic as the Dos Caminos of the world, its festiveness and friendliness of the staff makes this a preferred destination for some tequila and sharing some guacamole and chips. The plato fuertes and tacos have not been as good as they were pre-pandemic, but the ceviches and quesadillas are still fresh and fulfilling in my opinion. Concoct your own plate with the variety of sides/add-ons and it be a good time. Just stay way from the extremely charred brussels sprouts!"
5534,"I'll admit to being very picky about Mexican restaurants, having grown up in Southern California. My experience with Mexican restaurants in New York City has been nothing short of abysmal. So I was prepared for the same here, particularly when the salsa showed up and was something closer to cream of tomato soup.But then the short rib tacos with bone marrow arrived, and things changed completely. This was one of the best items I've ever had in a Mexican restaurant, and could easily have been served in many of the top fine dining small plate restaurants in the city.I'm not sure this one item fully justifies the four stars, but since the guacamole, Margarita, and ceviche were fine, it's at least a 3-1/2 star place. Just be sure to have the short ribs."
5535,"Had dinner with a friend at Toalache this past Thursday since it's near our offices in Rock Center.  We had trouble getting a reservation on OpenTable the night before but my friend called them directly and they made the reservation.  I'm glad we had one since when we arrived at 6:30 pm the place was packed.  We were seated downstairs so I never saw what the upstairs looked like.  The place was very loud and lively.  Our server was very helpful and we did not feel rushed during our meal.  I tried their take on a spicy margarita - it was a bit too cucumber/lime flavored for me.  To start, we shared the corn & truffle quesadilla - very tasty.  We each got an order of tacos - I had the Suadero which were very good. My friend had the shrimp.  We also shared the black truffle pumpkin rice as a side which we enjoyed.  Since the portions are pretty small, we had room for dessert.  Our server talked us into the churros but they were average at best.  While the food was really good, the portions are quite small for the pricetag.  Margaritas were expensive too - my spicy one was $17."
5536,"Good food and service. We had a 5pm reservation following a 7pm theater reservation and they were efficient at moving us along quickly. Food had lovely presentation, but small portions. Guacamole was a good size for the smaller portion we ordered. Dessert exceeded expectations. Pop rocks on top of chocolate cake with beautiful culinary presentation. Friendly and efficient wait staff. I recommend reservations if you want a table indoors. Would come again for sure. Very close to several theaters."
5537,"Randomly walked in after seeing a show nearby. Didn't have a reservation but they sat us at a little bar section. Didn't really have any expectations going in and it turned out to be an excellent experience!Service was a smidge slow but they were pretty busy and we were sitting in kind of a random place. We had a couple cocktails one which had full pieces of hibiscus inside. Both delicious and quite unique actually. Had the mild guacamole for an appetizer. Chips were fine but the guacamole was quite good. Very creamy and you can see them making it from scratch at the back of the main seating area. Had the yellowtail ceviche. Was nice to have a ceviche without shellfish so my partner could try some. Fish was fresh and the whole thing was presented very nicely. The standout of the dinner was the chicken breast. Super juicy and came with a fantastic corn salsa on the side. The sweetness of the corn just perfectly complemented the chicken and it was incredible!There was a bit of a draft through the door for where we were sitting, not sure why they couldn't close the door. And there is only 1 bathroom for the first floor so there was always a line. But otherwise the food was excellent and very different from the usual mexican fare of most places. Check em out for sure."
5538,"Craving some Mexican fare? This place had really tasty and attractively prepared food. Our servers were attentive and cheerful. (It's a little hard not to get their attention because our table for 2 was next to the kitchen entry and it was a single lane two way path.) Their popularity is evident by the number of patrons in their 2 levels and we were pretty packed in there. So if you want some yummy Mexican food and a robust crowd, this is the place for you!"
5539,"Late post! I don't know what the raving is about.. I have had Mexican food countless times. And, let me tell you the food is subpar. Dining here during covid times with vaccination cards proof. That's okay.. but even inside it was too crowded with people sitting so close. Staff was okay.. didn't feel really welcomed.From the overall experience, I questioned myself the choice of my restaurants over some other good ones that day! Sorry, but I just couldn't find any positives to share with the community."
5540,"The shrimp tacos were divine! The menu has plentiful gluten-free options. The cucumber margarita was glorious, and I wanted to marry the Brussels sprouts!"
5541,This was a great lunchtime find in midtown. The guacamole is every bit as good as past reviewers reported. Great value to taco selections coming with rice and beans during lunch service. My lechon tacos had an extra crunch texture and flavor due to bits of chicharron! The shredded chicken enchiladas was flavorful with accompanying subtle smoky sauce.Classic light and crunchy churros with both caramel and dark chocolate dipping sauces concluded a value packed midday meal.Will bookmark this eatery to patronize on my annual Big Apple visits!
5542,"Being from Los Angeles, I've had my fill of great Mexican restaurants. But, it's always great to check out a different interpretation of some of my favorites. While the tortilla soup didn't have the ""kick"" I was expecting and was a bit too much like tomato soup for my taste, the carne asada tacos were excellent. You get 2 per order and they have that street taco taste and look. My gorgeous date had the shrimp tacos and I thought those were even better. The Caesar salad was fresh and our friends ordered chips and guacamole for the table. The salsa was just ok but the guacamole was some of the best I've had. It was quite loud and very packed even for an early dinner on a Friday night. The service was excellent and we were able to get out of there quickly to catch a concert at MSG. Subway line is literally right outside the door."
5543,"Came here for dinner before a Broadway show and the place was bumpin! I can imagine they are probably busy everynight with people trying to catch a meal before heading off to the theaters near by... MAKE RESERVATIONS! We're lucky we got inside seating, seating outdoors seems pretty cold and the food would be cold as soon as it leaves the restuarant! We were tucked upstairs, in a corner, next to the railing. Get ready to get cozy, there's not much elbow space if you're seated upstairs. The lights are dim and the room is loud. Our servers were attentive and refilled our waters, cleared our tables without us asking. The food: We ordered the ""Bacalao Trufado"" -  fillet cod decorated with truffles on top, and ""Camarones Toloache"" - shimp on a tostada drenched in their homemade salsa. Both meals were delicious... but I don't think the shrimp was worth the price. We also ordered the guac trio, one traditional, one spicy, and one with fruits! (Never heard of that one before!) If you're feeling adventurous, I'd say go for the trio, but if you decide not to get it, you're not missing out either!! I'd definitely just stick with the original if I came back! We didn't get to try desserts because we were in a rush but next time I come back, we're definitely gonna order some!!"
5544,"This review was tough because the drinks were good, the ceviche tasting was VERY GOOD, but the paella was SUPER overcooked and the Carne Asada was nearly inedible. It tasted weird and just came with a weird cheese enchilada and potatoes (?!). Maybe we just got the two least favorite entrees on their menu, but I wish we had just gone with appetizers."
5545,"Excellent choice for pre-theatre dining! The staff was friendly and very attentive. We arrived early but were seated by our reserved time. The restaurant was completely full- bustling like Pre-COVID times, although this was the only draw back. The noise level was extremely high, making it difficult to converse at the table.  The Toloache Margarita and fresh guacamole were the perfect start to a delicious meal! We enjoyed the Carne Asada & Pollo Toloache, ending with crispy warm churros! A definite hit- I will be back again."
5546,"Went for dinner with friends last week. It was a warm night so we sat outside in one of the little cabins, which was nicer than being on the sidewalk (lots of street noise though, still). All the food was good, from the guacamole to the fish tacos (we had lobster and some other fish). But I think the portions were a bit on the small side, especially for the prices. The chocolate crunch cake was really good!The staff was so so. They brought our entrees while we were still eating our guacamole, so we weren't ready for them. And they weren't all that attentive after they brought the food. I'm always on the look out for good Mexican and I'd go back. But maybe better service inside."
5547,"The inside of this feels very ornate, great date spot, and service very friendly. We were seated immediately on a weeknight around 6:30. We got a seat on their balcony. We ordered the chips with guacamole and mild salsa and ceviche. The ceviche is served on a taco, tasted alright. Then we ordered the pork tacos and the short rib. The short rib taco was probably the best taco I've had in a longgg time. The flavor profile was dynamic, taco stayed intact the whole time, perfect amount of stuffing. Pork taco also delicious but less memorable. Overall thought every piece of food was great!"
5548,"Overall, a nice stop before a show.Admittedly skeptical before heading into one of only a few Mexican restaurants in NYC, we were pleasantly surprised by this one. The drinks are strong, and the appetizers are great.The reason for 4/5 is the main entree. First, they only brought one order out which I chalk up to a bit of a language barrier, secondly the meat in their tacos is a little on the... ""gamey"" side, which is weird for beef. It was not terrible, but also not what we expected.Overall, it's a nice stop, just maybe avoid beef items or at least prepare for an atypical flavor."
5549,"We were in NY for vacation and went to eat here.Food was amazing; we had tacos, so good. Very traditional mexican food"
5550,"The food was soooo good that I forgot to take pictures. We went thinking it was going to be a regular Mexican restaurant, but it was more on the upscale fancy side. We didn't have a reservation but they still got us a table within 5 minutes. Appetizers are more of a single serving appetizer, don't expect to be sharing with others. Food portions were just right for the price."
5551,"Made a reservation for the weekday for 7pm. I literally live one block away and got here right before my reservation time. The place wasn't that busy at all. They told me to wait a bit while they get their ish together and find my reservation. A couple walks in and immediately demands to be seated because they have a reservation. I'm a little peeved by this because I was obviously standing in line with the hostess and this couple ignores me. Whatever, chalk it up to the white privilege and colonizer mentality. But she served them first? Unacceptable. They decided to seat us in the worst location possible. On the street, where there's heavy foot traffic and where the sun is blasting into my eyes while it sets. Waited for my friend who promptly showed up afterwards.We sat down and caught up real quick, but one of the waiters came over and rushed us to order something. We just sat down and didn't even get a chance to look at the menus. I won't lie, I'm definitely guilty of never being ready to order and am mindful of this. But I also don't like being rushed and always ask for a few minutes. But something you haven't seen someone in a long time and want to catch up. He came back again and asked within 2 minutes. Unacceptable once again.I got the Carne Asada, though pretty pricey, I assumed it would have been pretty good by the amount of reviews and the waiter recommendation. I would agree that it's pretty good, but not $35 good.My friend asked for a recommendation and the waiter suggested the Tacos. My friend then asked about portion sizes and spiciness. He's Lebanese, so he loves spice and wanted to get full. Neither accomplished. He wanted to order more food but we were already having a bad experience with this place that we didn't want to give them more money.Overall, definitely a miss. I'd skip it. Could be a one-off experience though, so keep that in mind"
5552,"Good Mexican place with good cocktails, food and deserts.We loved everything we ordered (see attached photos) except the tortilla soup. Cocktails, quinoa paella, veggie enchiladas borrachas, and two deserts were yumm!!"
5553,"Booked lunch while waiting in line at the TKTS booth since the restaurant is nearby. Took the server's recommendation of the La Sandia Margarita (with watermelon and lime). Had a sugar and jalapeno rim. Neither of us loved them. Not important. The food was wonderful!!!My wife had the chilaquiles with eggs - a dish she discovered many years ago in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. She loved it!I had Carne Asada con Huevo - grilled skirt steak, two farm eggs, guacamole, mole cheese enchilada. The flavors were fantastic. Normally I put tabasco on my eggs. I used the salsa that was provided with the chips and it was perfect. The place itself has a nice ambiance, feeling mexican enough without feeling like a theme party.Loved it."
5554,"Horrible service. I've never been to a restaurant and had to wait almost 45 minutes for a glass of water. I understand it's short staffed everywhere but if it's that short, don't open up every table you have in a restaurant! The food wasn't even worth the wait for, the portions were tiny. My friend ordered the quesadilla and I ordered the hamachi ceviche- both looked like a kids meal with it's tiny portion- didn't even taste good. To top it all off, when our waitress decided to collect our bill, we gave her 5 credit cards and asked her to split it 5 ways and she said she could-then she came back saying we only gave her 4 cards and she ""missed"" the fifth card that was in one of the pockets and couldn't redo the transaction. Do not recommend!!"
5555,One of our favorite restaurants in the theater district. Excellent margaritas and the best guac and ceviche anywhere. Only suggestion is get a reservation since the place is small and runs busy. Service was great but prices were high. We will be back on our nest NY trip.
5556,Food was just ok. Everything was pretty bland. It looked pretty good. Service was not great. Server didn't check on us at all once the food was delivered. No offer to refil drinks.  Our guacamole had an odd taste and color and when I asked about it the server simply said that was how it was supposed to be.
5557,First time at the Times Square location     They had cute heated houses on the street that we choose to sit in We got an order of guacamole which was fresh and not spicyI had the short rib quesadilla that was very good but small portion    My friends had chicken quesadilla which was much larger and tons of chickenThe margaritas are fresh and go down smooth     They have tons to choose from
5558,"Disclaimer: I'm not a big fan of NYC Mexican food. Toloache's menu was different in many ways than the other Brunch spots I've checked out, in the past. They had atypical brunch dishes. So, it was nice to mix it up a bit. I can't remember the name of the dish, but I ended up having a poached egg in a spicy tomato sauce with sweet plantains and snow peas...#lovedit"
5559,"Favorite gourmet Mexican spot in the city- been coming here for years. Cocktails are solid, delicious, and bartenders are wonderful! Try all three guacamole's- each has a unique flavor and because it's guac so why not have more...Their tacos, particularly the bone marrow short rib, are absolutely amazing (and worth the $$)- every bite an explosion of flavor- you won't regret ordering this. We drive into the city looking forward to eating these because we've never eaten better tacos anywhere else (Los tacos no. 1 are also good, but not made with bone marrow which is the star ingredient in these tacos)."
5560,"Four of my friends and I were looking for a place to have a late dinner on a Saturday night, and found that most of the fun places in the area had a long wait.  Toloache struck the perfect balance between lively but not overcrowded.Outdoor seating was nicely spaced out, and hand sanitizer is available near their makeshift ""bar"" by the entrance.  Service was prompt and friendly, and their De La Casa margarita ($13) was delicious!  Unfortunately, the food was just a little underwhelming.  We shared salsa + guac with chips, which were both good.  For my entree, I ordered the arroz con mariscos ($34, ""like a Mexican paella,"" per our waiter), and it was bizarre.  The dish was essentially grilled seafood sitting on top of what could only be described as Chinese fried rice.  The seafood was cooked well, and the dish was not bad... but the rice was confusing and didn't really complement the seafood.  We also shared a dessert, which I remember being tasty even though I don't remember what we had because I had 2 margaritas in me after 6 months of not drinking during quarantine....A meal here is pricier than most Mexican places, but hey, you're in the Theater District and you're paying for the vibes.  My entree, 2 margaritas, 2 shared apps, 1 shared dessert, +tax/tip totaled just under $83.  Overall, a fun spot to visit with a group if you're in the area."
5561,Was a nice brunch time with the kiddos. Friendly service. I would go again as soon the weather get better. Because I sit outside.
5562,Great place with delicious drinks . The guacamole trio was delicious and they serve it with warm crispy chips . The employees are very friendly and efficient! Highly recommend it !
5563,Omg let's talk about they're birria tacos?!!! They are so delicious and let's also not forget they're signature red sangria! This place is a must try when in town. Customer service was great staff super accommodatingand overall great . I will definitely be coming back. Located in Theatre District.
5564,I had brunch before a Broadway show. The service was quick. Stephanie was very friendly and attentive. And the food was delicious
5565,"Really great place! Excellent service by Alexandra. Tacos were great, but the portion was a little small. The pumpkin truffle rice and tres leches were outstanding!"
5566,"Came here after a 2pm showing of Wicked. We had a 5:15 reservation, but got there a bit early. They were accommodating and sat us early. The restaurant was pretty busy but the wait staff was attentive. I ordered a De La Casa Margarita which was great. We started with the traditional guacamole and it was delicious. The salsa was also great - really smooth and a bit smoky. I had the lobster tocos and they were amazing! Avocado fries were just okay. My boyfriend enjoyed the short rib quesadilla. For dessert we had churros and we wanted something like an espresso martini. It was not on the menu but our waiter told us about the Toloache Martini. AMAZING! Portions are a bit on the small side, but the food was delicious. I would definitely return."
5567,"I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food but this place was awesome. We had the lobster tacos, tacos with bone marrow and beef short ribs, and finished it off with churros. The tacos were the most flavorful and delicious I have had. This is a huge compliment as I lived in CA and ate tacos regularly. They were fresh, wonderfully seasoned and truly delightful. They are a bit on the pricey side, you get 2 tacos for $18-20, but filling. We finished off with churros which was highly recommended and we were not disappointed. These churros were thinner and extra crispy and light!! Kudos to the chef and the entire staff!!"
5568,"A friend and I went after the theatre and found this place hit the spot in every way. I had the very delicious braised brisket tacos with a classic margarita. We ordered to guacamole with fruit which was better than expected!The only downside was the smallish tables and the steep stairs, but the decor otherwise is fantastic."
5569,"This is a wonderful spot for a mojito and some tacos! Overall we had a positive experience here but their weren't enough 5 star, outstanding dishes for us to put this at 5 stars. The decor is just lovely and service was some of the best we had in midtown. Best mojito I've had in a while!! Mango mojitos are made with what is clearly fresh (or high quality) mango juice and the coconut mojito was sweet without tasting artificial. Both packed a punch without tasting too strong to drink. The guacamole is excellent; creamy and perfectly balanced. Chips are solid and came out warm. The salsa served with the chips is wonderfully spicy and flavorful -- so much so that we used it on our entrees as well! The entrees were...fine, mostly. The paella de quinoa just wasn't very flavorful so that salsa came in handy there but it was full of fresh veggies cooked to perfection which we appreciated. The truffle quesadilla was overwhelming in truffle flavor when I prefer truffle flavor to not overpower but, rather, complement, other flavors. This was just way too much. The calabacita tacos were absolutely the best. Veggies were again cooked perfectly and seasoned well. Wish we had gotten more tacos! If you happen to be in the area it's worth a visit for some quality Mexican but if you are vegetarian be forewarned the three entrees we got are what you will have as veg options and unless you adore truffle I'd just stick with the tacos."
5570,This place is quite pricey but everything is really good. I like that they have reposado and anejo options for their margaritas instead of the usual blanco. The burrito was a whopping $18 but tasty.
5571,"I stopped by for dinner and sat at the bar on a weeknight recently. It was fine, but nothing too impressive. Service was good, and there was a soccer match on the TV. The burrito had great avocado (fresh), and they offered guacamole which seemed to be a go-to for them. But it just didn't have too much flavor. I asked for some hot sauce or salsa, and there was just one choice. Given the many options nearby, I'd probably try something else."
5572,"I was excited to try this place because of the good reviews but honestly it kind of disappointed. The tables were absolutely packed inside so you were pretty much back to back with the person next to you (not the best for COVID). The service was also really not great, our waitress was absent for about 30 minutes at one time and just didn't attend to our table enough.  The food was pretty solid but nothing to rave about. I got the chicken enchiladas and the sauce was pretty good but it lacked cheese and lots of flavor. The tacos that one person in my party got were also too small. The churros disappointed as well and tasted artificial."
5573,The guacamole is available in different flavors to satisfy many different tastes. The Chilean sea bass was flavorful and tender. One of the best sea bass restaurant dinners I've ever had. The ambiance is noisy but what you would expect in this area of the city. The service was rough and obviously they need more waitresses. Luckily the food made up for the quirky service.
5574,I came in with my mother on a Saturday around 330pm for a quick bite to eat and a drink. We were dismissed by the hostess because we didn't have a reservation. She told us we could sit outside but not inside. It was 50 degrees out so we wanted to be warm- the restaurants main floor only had 2 tables occupied. We told her we wouldn't be more than an hour and she said she could not accommodate us inside because she had reservations coming in and because we were not a party of 4 and dismissed us. So you're telling me that the entire restaurant would be at capacity within an hour the night before Halloween?! Highly unlikely.I am extremely disappointed because this is the SECOND time we were dismissed by the hostesses. It's a shame because the food and cocktails are amazing which is why my mother and I would frequent the place. Sad to say that we will not be returning and rude staff is a detriment to the industry.
5575,"Only ok. Service was good the night we were there, but the food was only ok. Highlights were the guacamole with pomegranate and the mezcalita. The guac trio was supposed to be mild medium and hot, but none really had any spice in my opinion. I ordered the cod and it was just not for me. Flavors just weren't there. In hindsight maybe the tacos would have been a better choice. Price also seemed high, but maybe that is just the way it is in NYC. Probably would not return."
5576,"Solid Mexican spot in the UWS. My girlfriend and I live right around the corner and decided to give it a shot. We loved the ambiance - classic yet updated. The place was slammed on a Saturday night. They had a party of 20 people here so the service was a bit slow but they were aware of that so I pride them on continuously updating us on our food. We ordered guacamole, enchiladas, and fried plantains. The guacamole was honestly very underwhelming. There was no heat at all, which was a bummer. The enchiladas were great and the plantains were perfect. The Diet Coke had no taste, I think a malfunction of their soda tap, but their sangria was solid. I'd come back and avoid the guac, I think this place is a 4-star with better service and more consistency."
5577,"The food and the service was great. I ordered chicken tacos with chips & salsa as well as the rice & black beans. Everything was delicious. The salsa was quite spicy, but it was good. I don't think I've ever tasted black beans cooked so well. The food was superb.However, it's expensive. The chicken tacos were $15. The price didn't include salsa & chips or the rice & black beans. I was surprised that I only got 2 mini tacos for that price.  I was expecting a bit more. So, I took away a star."
5578,"Loved the place, the service, the calm laid back atmosphere and the food. A top notch!!!"
5579,"Went here for drinks and dinner on a Wednesday night. The inside of the restaurant is beautiful and the server was attentive. Got margaritas that were incredible. The blackberry- hibiscus margarita was delicious and my boyfriend got the double which came in a size-able portion. We got the tacos which were a small portion but very delicious. We got the fish and shrimp tacos which were very flavorful, but would recommend something else if you are really hungry."
5580,Great decor/vibes for dinner. I ordered the pesto herb garganelli and my friends ordered the carbonara tagliatelle and alla vodka tagliatelle along with chicken parmigiana . I don't think my choice was the best because the garganelli was too al dente for me. I like it on the softer side because I grandma teeth lol. I'd come back though to try the other combinations. The portions are big too. Easily can share 1 pasta/sauce combo with a friend/partner/fling LOL. The chicken parm was my favorite. It had a kick to it which I loved. Definitely get it if you like a bit of spice in your food.
5581,"Tasty but some of the meals weren't seasoned well. Needed a ton of cheese and salt. Sunday sauce was great, both white sauce dishes needed way more seasoning"
5582,I got the herb garganelli with mushroom ragu and the sauce was well balanced throughout the dish. I went here years ago with a friend and the lamb ragu was so good we got it twice. I tried the rose sangria this time around and it was absolutely perfect. I also highly recommend the bucatini if you prefer a thinner pasta
5583,"We went here for a friend's birthday and it was OK. We arrived and it was pretty empty we was seated in a nice booth.  I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted so I ordered a few things. I went with the house made pasta and marinara with an order of calamari. My friend chicken parm with arrabiata pasta and our other friend went with some very robust noodles with a red Ragu sauce. Everyone's dishes looked amazing and they tasted just as good. Yaaay!I found it odd we were seated with a clear view of the kitchen, and the place was pretty empty. I'm not sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing. The good: we could see the food being prepared and it was spotless. Dishes were being created and pushed out in record time. The bad: the kitchen staff seemed to be perturbed we could see them and took it out on our orders of breadsticks.  They repeatedly told the waitstaff its in the oven. This lie went on for over an hour and a half. Food came. We ate. Drank and packed the leftovers. Still, nada. We were committed. So we waited them out. Finally they showed up and they were fantastic. I was sad because my allergies to to whole wheat kept from eating bread with pasta. Note: the drinks are all $14, even the canned specialty ones. Choose accordingly."
5584,"I cannot overstate how amazing this place was. The service, the ambiance, the food-- all AMAZING. Our waiter Marto was amazing, he brought so much positive energy to our dinner experience! We got:- cavatelli with arrabiata: AMAZING! My favorite arrabiata ever! Highly highly recommend! - mafalga with garlic pecorino: Also delicious, the sauce was so creamy! The pasta was also so pretty - risotto: DELICIOUS! I'm not a mushroom fan but I still LOVED this dish! Also, the breadsticks are TO DIE FOR. haven't had better breadsticks anywhere else!! Highly recommend this restaurant!"
5585,"Aunt Jake's is a beautiful modern restaurant with multiple options to mix and Match pastas and sauces It was our first time here , our server's recommendations of wine and food was great , we loved the food and drinks , but we noticed our server was the only employee working on a busy night , he made couple bespoke drinks from the menu, and took my daughter's allergies very serious and managed to keep a smile on while multitasking We definitely recommend this place !!!!!!!"
5586,"My favorite place whenever I'm craving pasta! They have a create your own pasta option with various pasta shapes and  sauces you can mix and match. I personally love the Mafalda with Roasted Garlic Pecorino. Truffle fries are a must but the beignets were okay, not what one would expect if you're thinking of the New Orleans ones. Service is phenomenal, would 10/10 come back next time the pasta cravings come back!"
5587,Had the best birthday dinner here! Honestly the most ROMANTIC place in the city. They played Frank Sinatra all night. Definitely the classiest restaurant in ALL of Little Italy. Other restaurants were playing the radio (we did a walk by after our dinner). The food was incredible. The pasta is handmade daily. So fresh and so good!! I will definitely be back. Please look at my photos although it doesn't do it justice. The service was typical NY style and class. Definitely laid back atmosphere. I wore jeans and a sweater but felt super special the whole time. I will be telling all of my friends and family about this place
5588,"No doubt the worst service I've ever had. Waited 40+ minutes for our server to even acknowledge us. Sat outside and was not made aware of the limited menu options until we waited 40+ minutes to order. Server was rude, short with us and acted like we did not exist. Would not eat here at this location again.EDIT: I would be embarrassed to work here if you were the owner. Very unprofessional and hateful. Not sure how you can claim we didn't wait 40+ minutes when you clearly were not there dining with us. The hostess told us seats outside were first come first serve, so we did as so. The limited menu wasn't the problem. Being made aware of it after 40 minutes of waiting was the problem. Also noticed other customers eating right next to us not having a ""limited menu"" item. Not too sure why you can't handle criticism."
5589,"The interior was super pretty and nice but the food was just ok. The calamari tasted better than my entree. The squid ink pasta didn't taste like anything special, in fact it didn't really have any flavor. The sauce was bland and basic."
5590,"Don't overthink it, just go!The restaurant itself is pretty nice inside and there's not enough to be said about the courteousness and attentiveness of the wait staff. You'll notice from the moment you enter.It's perfect for casual date night where you want something above your run of the mill Olive Garden in terms of quality, service and most importantly food. You won't be let down.If in doubt and you have no clue what to get I highly recommend the chicken parm. It's classic and not too many people or picky about it but this chicken parm is taken to another level. From the moment it hits your table you'll start to salivate. Your palate will begin to have high expectations for what you're about to have. Then the moment comes where you actually slice off a piece and raise that fork to your mouth. At that point you'll notice your palate underestimated how delicious it really is.Can't say enough about it. Just go!"
5591,"I was expecting overpriced Italian food, but I was surprised how flavorful everything was. We got the squid ink pasta and mussels. They were decorated with bread shaped into a heart, so cute . I also ordered a glass of Sangria. The squid ink pasta was pretty good, not very saucy though. I enjoyed it more dipping it into the mussels, which had a very strong white wine taste that I very much appreciated. The staff here is super friendly and inviting! We came here with our little nephew, and the waiters interacted with him and checked up on us frequently. The food is even better!"
5592,"Came here for an anniversary dinner. Unfortunately they do not have any specials - but I do think that their menu is cheaper than what is advertised. The tables are a bit close for comfort with covid, but they face the chairs so that no one is really breathing into anyone's face I suppose. The space itself is super nice, and even though you are right next to the street it doesn't feel like that. The service was great. Our server was this kind older woman who was super attentive and friendly.We got the fried calamari which was perfectly seasoned and cooked. I only wish that they had provided us with more of that great sauce. For our entrees we did the create your own pasta and got one with the crumbled meatballs and another in pesto. The crumbled meatballs were actually really good. The pesto on the other hand was not great. I think the menu says that it is not oil based, but we didn't really pay any mind to that and got it. It was super dry and not flavorful at all. I will say that although the dishes look small though, however, they are extremely filling. We could have probably made do with one pasta dish and the calamari. Overall a decent place and cute for a date night. Might come here again but would definitely not get the pesto."
5593,"This is a great place for an intimate gathering with cute interior decor. It was a rather busy night so our server, Javier,was apologetic for the service. You could also recommend things for the bar to create your own cocktail suited for your tastes...mine was decent, tasted very much like a mojito but fun to experience. Two of my friends didn't like theirs and had other drinks prepared, which was nice of the restaurant to do but also noted on their menu. I got the chicken parmigiana which was HUGE with a side of pasta. I had some leftovers for the next day but it was delicious...just probably more than what I wanted for dinner. Javier ended up bringing us a bottle of wine (which we chose over shots) for the unhappy drinks and service so I appreciated that! I would definitely come back as my friends' food and comments were all so great!"
5594,"OMG!! Only one word to describe this restaurant, OUTSTANDING!!!I brought my family from up estate Saturday night , this young charming girl greeted us at the door with a beautiful smile , I didn't get her name but she was so friendly and treated us like family, we had no reservation and some how she managed to get us the best table for 5 in the restaurant by the front window on a crazy busy night Our server javier  was great ! it was our second time here , it looked like they were understaffed but service, food and drinks were one of the best ever , we even joke with our server and asked if he was the only one  working that night The chicken parm  is to die for , the Mafalda and Sunday sauce are one of a kind and the aunt Jake's cocktail was delicious as always Over all amazing food and great customer service , we'll definitely will be back!!  Don't get distracted by the other places offering free wine with diner across the street, THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!!!"
5595,"I came to the same spot years ago and can say the quality has tanked pretty drastically. The pasta was overcooked and mushy, the sauce too acidic with very little meat, and the kale Caesar appetizer was poorly made. There was way too much cheese and almost no dressing, and they used a cheaper type of kale and left the hard stems in. Pretty disappointed, I used to love this spot. Probably won't be back."
5596,"One of those restaurants on Mulberry Street in Little Italy, Manhattan that you can easily miss! Upon arrival, there was a man standing at the table up front who greeted me and asked if I made reservation. I told him my parties name and he guided me to the rest of my friends. The restaurant was surprisingly spacious and not packed on a Saturday night. They have a vast bar and three separate unisex bathrooms. I came with a party of 6 and the meals were around $25 each. The waiter who took our order was very friendly and described things in detail. However, three out of six of our orders were messed up and we had to wait an additional 10 minutes for them. I ordered a Shrimp Scampi which was rather dry and the shrimp was overcooked but the sour flavoring was good. The bread that came with it was not very tasty and more on the burnt side. One of my friends ordered a squid ink pasta that came with clams and it looked good - would want to try. The complimentary garlic bread sticks that was served before our meals came were absolutely delicious though - definitely everyone's favorite!"
5597,"The thing that got me for this place was the bespoke drinks! Such a fun concept and a welcome surprise. We got four drinks total and all of them were amazing - a sweet pineapple rum, sweet pear vodka, and two mint cucumber vodka drinks. Not only were the drinks amazing but the FOOD. The portions were huge and the food was also customizable. It really makes you feel like you have unlimited choices.We got the burrata toast which was FULL of burrata, definitely worth the price. Wish it would have had a bit more flavor. For mains, we got the sunday sauce with mafalda and carbonara with cavatelli. Both were amazing. The meat in the sunday sauce was tender and flavorful. The cavatelli was perfectly cooked and just the right amount of chew. Again, a bit more flavor would be great for the carbonara sauce but matched well with the cavatelli. And did I mention portion sizes? Leftovers for days..."
5598,"amazing options on the menu and the portion sizes blew me away. the calamari appetizer was also a great portion size, however the flavor and the dipping sauces didn't really add much. The meatballs as an appetizer were also alright; I'd recommend forgoing the appetizers and going straight to the entrees. Service was also fast and interior is very pretty. Also every easy to get a reservation."
5599,I am so glad I came by this place... we were wandering around Chinatown to find a place to eat Chinese food with friends visiting but everything was booked. As we were deciding to get home we passed by Aunt Jake's and obviously stopped when saw the place was beautifully decorated and the price range ok for the area  Best choice! The place is really nice And the food is really tasty!! I had the pen alla vodka. it was the second time trying this sauce but it reached way more than my expectations !!! My friends all loved their food too especially the burrata and we have been willing to go again !
5600,"I was in the area with 13 family members and we needed lunch. Found this place on google and first impression was new, renovated ""like restaurant"". Wasn't expecting much more than tourists menu etc. after placing and order it took some time to start getting the food (they are short on stuff after COVID). And then the food arrived. The appetizers were soooo good, burrata cheese were made just before it was on our table, guacamole with artichokes on sourdough bread is fantastic.  The choice of pastas is great and you can pair any sauce to any pasta.  After trying the pasta I got suspicious that the pasta is also freshly made, so I asked our very nice waiter and he was kind enough to offer me to take a short tour in the basement where they make all the pasta fresh daily. Overall great experience. Good price and service. The food is incredible. Thanks."
5601,I've just ordered pasta for takout and was blown away! love that you can pick what pasta you want with what sauce (all fresh). portions are huge too! it lasted 3 meals for 2 people. can't wait to try more combinations! so far squid in bucatini is the favorite
5602,"Unfortunately Aunt Jake's fell short for us. I made a reservation easily for a Friday night. The restaurant was pretty busy and seems like a good spot for groups. We started with the complimentary breadsticks which were crunchy and light. For my pasta, I ordered the Squid Ink Bucatini with Pesto. I was excited when the bowl came because it was a very substantial portion. However, when I tasted it, it seemed like the chef had forgotten the salt? It basically tasted like pasta tossed in basil with no additional flavor. I added the parm and it helped a little but I ended up having to ask our waiter for salt. I also tried some of the Carbonara and it was the same for some reason. It was so bland too and we had to add salt. We both were confused because we've never had to ask a restaurant for salt, and more often than not, dishes at restaurants tend to be too salty for my taste. It was strange but probably just a fluke given the other reviews. Pasta was perfectly al dente though so that was good."
5603,"The waiter was very kind and nice, the atmosphere is very quite and peaceful.  The eggplant salad was yum and meatball pasta was  nomnom!"
5604,Talk about DELICIOUS food!!!!!! The Burrata starter will keep me coming back for MORE! All the pastas are handmade in house and it's always hard to make a decision. This time I went with Cavatelli and Roasted Garlic Pecorino sauce. A MUST place to visit for ANY Italian food lover!!!! A+++
5605,One of my favorite pasta places to take my friends visiting the city. Their pasta is cooked perfectly al dente every single time. MUST GET THE PESTO SAUCE WITH RAVIOLI!! Best ravioli and pesto sauce I've had so far in the city.
5606,Terrible service. Took over an hour to get our food order in. Restaurant is on mulberry which is inherently super busy but apparently the restaurant is used to getting harassed by the same person on the street. This happened the night we were there (story deserves it's own review lol) and the staff did virtually nothing to intervene or diffuse the situation. Food was overpriced and lacked flavor. Was so sad that this was my experience because I had her nothing but good things up until that point and I was so excited to try it!
5607,"This spot has such a cute and cozy design -- it's almost as if I'm at my grandma's house! Eva Chen once posted this on her Instagram and because of her I came across this place! After visiting the restaurant once it's become my favorite Italian restaurant that I used to visit often (pre-pandemic when I still commuted to the city)! I would also drag my out of town friends here always! I love their sangria and the black ink squid pasta -- which is always my go to! I highly recommend getting the mussels and using the sauce from the mussels to dip bread into it because the sauce is to die for -- it's infused with white wine and garlic! Who doesn't love a garlicky sauce? Don't forget to also pick up a calamari because it's super crispy and tasty! Lastly, the avocado toast here is good because it's combined with artichoke so it's not another overpriced NYC avocado toast with just avocado spread over a sourdough bread! It's a lot of food but it makes for a great leftover! If I were still in the city I'd be going here once every week!"
5608,"On a crazy cold NYC day - what could be better than having allllllll of the i-talian comfort foods for lunch?   When we arrived at Aunt Jake's - we were legit the only three people in the entire restaurant. Typically this would worry me but b/c it was sooo cold outside I didn't think too much about it and just kept ordering more yummy sounding things.  We started w/ an Italian Beet Salad and the Meatballs.   Both were FANTASTIC.  I'm not usually a beet kinda gal but these were sweet and tender and when eaten w/ a bite of fresh ricotta - ohmygoodness.  So good.  That ricotta also worked reallllllly well with the all beef meatballs.  Def. suggest ordering both for the table. For my main meal I selected the cavatelli with roasted garlic percornio (aka cream + garlic + butter) and it. was. gooooooood.  Creamy, al dente, and super filling.  I could only finish half and then requested to take the rest home.  Note - the garlic sauce doesn't heat up as well at home... just an fyi.  But if I hadn't filled up on beets and meatballs before I probably could have finished up the pasta. :-PBeyond the food - the space is BEAUTIFUL.  Raw wood, white tile, light sage green paint, plants everywhere.  Very farmhouse vintage and just beautiful!  The gent rolling and cutting fresh pasta up at the front of the bar area was a nice touch too. So many great things to say about Aunt Jake's and I am very much looking forward to another visit."
5609,This is a wonderful restaurant! Such an great atmosphere and amazing menu. The red wine was delicious and you can choose any type of pasta and sauce convo. Javier was our server and he really took care of us and made it a great experience!
5610,I agree with the previous post . The only people working hard at this place are the minorities.instead of insulting people maybe you should have some class and investigate what is going on in your restaurant . And please don't respond back raving about how long you've been in business selling watery prego sauce pasta
5611,"Aunt Jake's is a favorite for my boyfriend and I. Being semi new to the city, I'm not the kind of person to go to the same restaurant twice unless I LOVE it and Aunt Jake's is absolutely the kind of place you can't not go again. If you're looking for the best item on the menu, get the Sunday sauce. Trust me."
5612,"The pasta was fresh and I loved that you were able to mix & match so many different types of pasta, sauces, and proteins! My boyfriend & I shared a bowl and it was PLENTY for 2 big eaters. The breadsticks on the side were delightful as well :)"
5613,"Perfect spot for date night! Pasta was delicious, got the carbonara and alla vodka - both were incredible. Highly recommend getting the cavatelli pasta! Also the service was amazing, the staff was so friendly and personable. They really helped make for an amazing night!"
5614,"I'm always weary of Italian Restaurants because of the amount of pork they tend to cook (I'm Muslim) but Aunt Jake's is a pleasant exception. To start, we enjoyed a great Pinot Noir with the breadsticks that are perfect in size and taste. For our entrees, we had the Chicken Parm; two huge, flavorful chicken breasts cutlets doused in the perfect amount of marinara and a layer of fresh mozzarella. With that, we ordered the Three Cheese Meat Lasagna, and Herb Garganelli in a Roasted Garlic Pecorino sauce. Both were spectacular. We were way too full to even look at dessert but based on the entree's, I'm sure they are equally delectable. Well worth the try."
5615,"3.5 stars. Came for Sunday dinner with two friends and were seated upstairs. It's pretty up there, but it's so dim that it was bothering all of us. It's a great place for large group dinners; while we were there, there were two other parties of ten people or so having a great time. The downstairs was filled with tweens when we were there.  Burrata - my table shared this and really enjoyed it. It is loaded, and was big enough to share among three. Lamb - I thought this was okay. The lamb was very good and braised so well, but there was so little of it. It comes with a huge portion of cavatelli, and it was really creamy, but tasteless. I don't know, it's a big bowl, but tastewise, it felt lacking. Affogato- vanilla ice cream with a shot of espresso to pour on it. It comes with two sticks of chocolate biscotti to dip into it. Joe, our waiter, was kind enough to put candles in it, because we were celebrating all of our birthdays. We all really enjoyed this!In terms of service, Joe was on top of everything and helpful with us choosing. The host, however, was pretty snooty and unfriendly; he left a bad taste in my mouth. It was a good experience overall, but my meal was just forgettable. If you want to create your own pasta, Aunt Jake's is a worthwhile option."
5616,"3.5/5 BEST tagliatelle pasta I've ever had, but there were some other misses that ruined it. Possibly the brightest and nicest looking Italian place I've dined at recently (but when I say bright, think dimmed lighting). However, since everything is made from scratch, and it's Italian food, Aunt Jakes really delivers that lifestyle. For instance, waiting foreverrrrrr for food. Waiting for appetizers. Waiting for entrees. Waiting for desserts. Waiting for check. All that took three hours. YEP WE HAD A THREE HOUR LUNCH. Company lunch tho so it's okCalamari ($27): hands down the WORST calamari I've ever had. So deep fried and rock hard to the point where that crunch isn't even desirable anymore. Actual calamari was tiny and rubbery. Never again Mussels ($29): starting to see that Aunt Jake's only purchases tiny seafood to serve their diners because these mussels? The size of a pistachio nut. Sigh. Didn't really like the sauce, but I can't say no to mussels, even if they're itty bittyTagliatelle in Sunday Sauce ($22): this is an create your own pasta dish. I fell in LOVE with the tagliatelle. Best I've ever had. SO fresh and chewy, I don't think I can ever think of pasta in a different way again (as in my overcooked pasta dinners at home). I probably should've gone with a different sauce since I don't really like marina, but I really wanted a meaty sauce, so I decided to try. It's decent, but they only gave me one piece of sausage. Bummer. Pretty decent portion (I had to take half for home)Tiramisu ($8): sooooo good. It was more of a cake than a tiramisu but it was heavenly! Ultra soft layers and loved the cream!Sundae ($16): one of those ginormous sundaes that you can skip unless you haven't had chocolate ice cream in three years and are going through withdrawal. Otherwise, that sugar OD is notttt worth itAlso, the arrabiata (marinara sauce with chili peppers and roasted garlic) sauce is one of the most interesting and delicious pasta sauces I've ever tried. My friend ordered it with tricolored pasta and the sauce was this spicy tomato-y goodness that really wowed me. Yumm"
5617,"First meal in NYC. Our hotel was just one black from Little Italy and Autn Jake's just a short walk away. Who doesn't want pasta on a chilly winter NY night? We were able to make a reservation for the same night, which is always impressive. I could smell the goodness almost immediately. We started off with the beef carpacio and I had their White Margarita which is actually red haha. It was nice. The beef carpacio was tasty and a nice app while you wait for dinner. For dinner I ordered their carbonara on tagliatelle pasta. My husband had their lasagna. They were both amazing and worth a visit back. Great experience in the heart of Little Italy!"
5618,"I had such a great time at Aunt Jake's Little Italy! The occasion was my best friend's birthday and with all the restrictions, safety precautions and such, I wasn't sure how we were going to dine out while being safe and warm. While many restaurants offer outdoor dining, the outdoor heating options are no match for the frigid New York air in February. With that in mind, I called the restaurant in advance on the day of, to inquire about seating options. They let me know that I could make a reservation via OpenTable and request specifics. I was very impressed by their phone etiquette and went ahead and made the reservation. Although it was Valentine's Day weekend, I was able to book a table for two for that evening. When we arrived, we were promptly greeted, made aware of safety precautions, and seated by the manager J. Throughout our entire time at the restaurant, we were made to feel like royalty. Everyone in the establishment was super-friendly and on point. They even gave me some tea to warm me up. I ordered the salmon and boy-oh-boy was it a delight. The salmon came well-done how I like it and it was placed over some mashed up lima beans and corn. I don't really like lima beans but they cooked it in a way that went perfect with the salmon. The portion was just the right size and although I could've finished it then and there, it was so savory that I decided to take half of it home. I don't know why I didn't just order another. My friend had the ravioli with cheese and stuff and she liked hers as well. Oh, and by the way, the bread basket they bring out pre-meal was tasty too! On to surprises...I wanted to do the whole cake thing and surprise my friend but I didn't want to make it obvious by ""going to the restroom"" and telling the waitstaff so instead I typed it in my phone, showed it to the waiter and asked them if they have, ""It's my friends birthday so can you all bring out a slice of carrot cake as a surprise..."" while asking if they had the type of cake I had in my phone. Funny thing is, as soon as I went to put my phone away the staff was already on the way out, singing happy birthday to my friend. So, in all actuality, we were both surprised LOL. They bought out tiramisu and asked if I still wanted the carrot cake. I ordered the donuts with dip instead. They took a while to come out but were so worth the wait, being as astoundingly good as they were. Last but not least, my glass of coke with the extra huge ice chunks was phenomenally good. But I must say that the best part of this experience was that I got to celebrate my friend's birthday in a restaurant that provided exemplary service, leaving a positively lasting impression. Thank you to the manger Jason and all others at the establishment!"
5619,Overall not a good restaurant. Pasta was either over or under cooked. Flavors were missing. Appetizers were the best part of
5620,"I can only imagine that there are a few experiences we have in this life where the food transcends all standards to become 'other worldly'.  That was this meal for me.  Not only was each course banging with flavor and freshness, I truly didn't have one complaint or find fault with any aspect of the dishes we ordered.  The lamb nachos were packed with flavor in every bite and the freshness of the wonton chips did not go un noticed.  The mac and cheese was thick and creamy and something dreams are made of.  That appetizer will stay with me for a while.I took a different route than my usual selections and opted for a falafel burger.  The falafel was humongous and not dried out.  It paired perfectly with the vegetables on the burger and side salad.  For dessert we couldn't decide so decided to split the doughnuts and brownie.  Whoever is working that kitchen is a genius.The staff there was super friendly and attentive, and it really made for a perfect night out.Oh! And Saturday night they have 1/2 price bottles of wine staring at 6pm! Cheers!"
5621,"I came here to dine the first night after a long flight from LA to NYC. My expectations were pretty high since I've heard a lot of good things about this place, but I was kind of disappointed with the food quality. My friends got the truffle mac and cheese and fish and chips, I got the mushroom flatbread with a side salad. The fish and chips were decent, but nothing extraordinary. My mushroom flatbread was dry, not enough cheese and the side salad vegetables were wilted and didn't taste very fresh. The flatbread was also pretty bland, cheese and topping ratio to bread for me was a tad bit disproportionate. I would have loved more melty cheese and mushrooms on it. However, the service was much better than the food here, and I am so grateful that they accommodated my large party of 15 people at the restaurant. The Christmas decor was also such a nice touch and added a warmth to the restaurant that I really appreciated. Overall, it was a decent experience but I'm not sure this spot will be on my itinerary the next time I visit NY."
5622,"I really like this spot! Its got a great bar area and seating area. The beer selection is really good, with some house selections that are pretty good too! The menu is expansive, definitely featuing something for everyone. I've tried the wings, herbed fries, chicken pot pie, fish tacos, and tuna tartare. The fries and accompanying sauces are great. Fish tacos were very tasty and fresh albeit pretty spicy! Wings were very well seasoned and bursting with flavor, but again, pretty spicy! Tuna tartare was alright, definitely fresh but lacking in flavor. Pot pie was very warming and cozy, but not amazing. The vibes here are very relaxed and it's definitely a nice spot to spend your Saturday afternoon in. They also have trivia on Sundays I believe but I have yet to attend! Pretty cool spot!"
5623,I had the most amazing birthday experience here. The staff was so welcoming and accommodating and really made it a special event. The guests were raving about the food and drinks. I would highly recommend Cask to anyone.
5624,Every time I go to Cask it is good. They have a great bar to sit at if you can get a seat. Half off bottles of wine is one of their happy hour days. All of the food I've had is delicious. The restaurant is a great environment. A great go-to!
5625,"I haven't been writing many reviews as I've been all over the place transferring jobs and apartments annnnnnnnd lifestyles; what better way to kick of my return to the keyboard than with Cask?!I came here with a buddy for the happy hour oysters as ya do, but they only have that special during the week, get them delivered almost every single day and once they are gone they are gone.This being said, despite that setback, the place is great!  Here's why:* They had great music the entire time* Both bartenders were nice and could hold a chill conversation * The beer selection does the job* The Fish tacos are out of this world (and didn't look like it when they put them down in front of me)* The entire place passes the local vibe check with flying colors.Seriously l, I loved these fish tacos, my buddy enjoyed the grilled cheese, we sat and had another drink because the place was so easy to be in, and convos with other customers really confirmed my sentiments."
5626,"Had a lovely brunch at Cask today! Went with a group of 6 and they put us at a round table. Loved the round table; made it much easier to talk to everyone. Our server was very attentive and took our drink order right away. We started with the bag of donuts for the table. Delicious! They were cinnamon sugar with a warm chocolate sauce. Then for our entrees we got a crispy chicken sandwich, bananas foster french toast, mac n cheese, and the chopped veggie salad. All were great and everyone enjoyed their meal. Will be coming back here!"
5627,"The burger was good and solid, cooked the way I wanted it with solid fries. Got the job done. What stuck out to me was the incredibly slow and inattentive service, took several attempts to wave them to us to take our order and bill, could have just been a bad day. The food is good though."
5628,"I came here one time with my friend who lives in the area because we wanted to grab a drink after dinner. We were able to be seated right away and they had very nice outdoor and indoor dining! We started off with some cocktails (I got ""I'm on a Boat"" and my friend got ""No Mistakes"") and holy cow... some of the strongest and delicious drinks I've had. We honestly went for a lowkey after dinner drink but ended up ordering more as they were so delicious and strong. We shared the lamb nachos which were a little dry and not hot when they came out, which was disappointing. Overall the atmosphere and service was great and definitely need to check this place out for brunch!"
5629,Perfect place to meet friends for drinks and apps. The ambiance is fun and cool but not too loud or crowded. Highly recommend getting the pigs in a blanket!
5630,"We were in Cask Friday March 18th for dinner, there was 4 of us, the food was a massive let down from start to finish, the flatbreads came out barely cook, still doughy, None of the (4) of us finished the entrees, my bolognaise was only luke warm obviously was sitting in the kitchen for ages, the pulled pork was dry, no sauce & was like it had been there for a week, the (2) herb chicken dinners were dry & over cooked. Our server never even questioned why there was so much food left on the plates which to me is a bad sign. The reason I didnt make a big deal on the night was it was my friends 40th & he was over from London & it was his birthday dinner. Beautiful bar & lovely ambience but the whole dining experience was disaster food was just subpar & completed lacking, its not a good things when all (4) of us didnt enjoy our meals.Lastly I email the above comments to the bar on 03/19 & noone was has emailed me back, which I'm shocked that I wasnt contacted with some sort of apology, doesnt say much about the management when they cant reach out when someone contacts them directly with a complaint about the food."
5631,"Happy hour prices for drinks are pretty fair. However, I found the food to be extremely underwhelming. My party and I ordered the flatbread and the fish and chips. Flatbread tasted bland, and the fish and chips were not crispy at all and underseasoned. Ambience is very nice and the staff was super friendly though; however, I wouldn't find myself coming back any time soon."
5632,"When meeting old coworkers who are uptown and I'm downtown, the logical choice is midtown.  Cask is reliably a good time. The cocktails are great and there are so many dishes to share including wings and veggies. I first came here 10 years ago with a coworker at the time and ended up hosting a birthday dinner at their center table a year later."
5633,"I've been here several times and haven't rated them because I was too busy having such a good time here. Shame on me! You're always greeted by a warm and attentive hostess and due to the pandemic and it's status you have a choice of being seated indoor or outdoor. I prefer their indoor just because of their chique design and it is summer so I prefer a cool air conditioned environment. The food quality is phenomenal. Every dish I've had was delicious and filling. The price is fair, food is delicious, and there's warm hospitality. What more can I say?"
5634,Good vibe from the minute you walk in.  The food had some amazing flavors.  Definitely worth it
5635,"Got a table for two outside right away on a friday night around 8 pm. Ordered a falafel burger which came with some salad. There was a little too much dressing on the salad and the burger was very big, almost too hard to bite. I ended up taking it apart to eat it but it was good."
5636,"What a great place my friend recommended. I took a video of the food (that Yelp won't let me attach to this review via the app?) and I wish I had taken photos. First- Oyster happy hour! $1.50 each until 6pm. A really good deal. We started with a dozen of those and devoured them so quickly that we didn't get to enjoy them alongside the suggested bottle of rosé.We did end up ordering a bottle of rosé which was cost efficient for two people. I ordered the blackened fish tacos & my friend order the mushroom flatbread and the margherita flatbread to go. The tacos were DELICIOUS! I'm always cautious about ordering tacos from upscale places like this because the cost rarely matches the quality. But they surpassed my expectations! I'm now a fan of this place.Also, I didn't get their names, but the gentleman & lady bartender who took care of us on 7/20 evening, y'all are awesome!"
5637,"Very cute and lively place on a Friday evening! Make sure to make a reservation for dinner hours because it was packed. We were lucky enough to get a table outdoors under a heater however the indoor seating is two stories with a bar. We only had drinks but the spicy blood orange margaritas were phenomenal! Service was great and did not rush us which was appreciated! We ended up not eating but everything that came out of the kitchen from the burgers to the Mac and cheese looked great! The atmosphere is a little loud so be prepared for that! Otherwise, it's a great date night spot or a place to go out with friends for a low key night!"
5638,"We came here on a Friday evening and were able to get a table outside immediately. I sat down and soon realized that the outdoor seating area was built at an angle. The table was up to my shoulders because of how steep the angle is--I ended up trading seats with my boyfriend so I was at the top of the hill. This was also an issue later when we ordered drinks because the table was so slanted that our drinks started sliding towards my boyfriend! I ordered the grilled cheese and it was honestly amazing. I'm always nervous about buying food I can easily make myself at home, but this sandwich was really that good. The fries were also good (they almost reminded me of McDonald's fries in the way that they're so addictive). My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork sandwich and he was a very big fan.Our drinks were great, especially because we ordered off the happy hour menu so they were $9 each. The food was great, I just probably won't eat in the outdoor area again. I didn't like how close we were to other guests--I could hear everyone's conversations and it was also just a very tight squeeze. The tables are only inches away from each other, which isn't the most pleasant experience during a pandemic. It also doesn't help that the shed is built on a hill, so our drinks kept sliding around. Great food, amazing drinks at a reasonable price, but maybe sit inside if you can."
5639,"You got to come here just for the mac and cheese. It was the right blend of cheeses and it came to the table so hot. The trade off here is that there is no bottomless mimosas. However, you pay for a pitcher which is arguably tastier and definitely better quality. I think we had the rose pitcher, it was so good. The service was also super nice as well!!"
5640,Crowded but moved fast. B.E.C. and the works breakfast sandwiches were very good. Bagels and spreads were delicious.
5641,"Liberty bagels is THE definition of ""having a Manhattan bagel""! Whether it's the perfect toasted sesame with cream cheese and thinly sliced lox or a plump rainbow with seasonal pumpkin cream cheese  - really the absolute best. The place is packed but the line moves quickly. Very much worth it and I heard they now have another location on 58th between 5th and 6th. That's even more convenient for me near Central Park ! Happy eating everyone"
5642,"I know there is a big debate across NYC for the best bagels so I tried a few of the top names in the city but my favorite had to be Liberty! I even made sure to make room in my suitcase to carry back a dozen of their bagels with some birthday cake cream cheese haha. My favorite was the rainbow/holiday themed (I don't remember the real name but there were holiday themed + normal rainbow) bagels with birthday cake cream cheese! I was a bit worried it would be too sweet but it was the absolute perfect level of sweetness for me and I couldn't get enough of it! Since I'm not in a good bagel city I'm currently researching how to make this cream cheese at home, might have to fly back to NYC (but honestly I would probably fly back to eat these bagels again lol). Someone even walked into the store and yelled that these were the best bagels in NY so it's not just me (:"
5643,"This place has great bagels, but the line is always out the door. I don't think the bagel is worth the wait, but if want the bagel without the wait check out the tip below:Order your bagel online (through Yelp) and pick it up. You can schedule the time you want it ready so you don't have to rush over. There isn't much seating to eat there so you'll probably end up going somewhere else to eat anyways. This will save you time and you'll get a great bagel without the waitOr you can wait in line if that's your thing."
5644,"If you're a fan of authentic New York-style bagels, Liberty Bagels Midtown is definitely worth a visit! The bagels are made fresh every day, and they're absolutely delicious. They have a great selection of flavors, too, so there's something for everyone.The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and they're always happy to help. The store is clean and well-maintained, and it's a great place to stop for a quick snack or a full breakfast or lunch. I highly recommend Liberty Bagels Midtown for anyone looking for a great bagel in New York City."
5645,"Fast place to grab a breakfast with TONS of choices. There's something for everyone here!  Busy location but you can always order online and pickup to avoid the wait. Great service, great food, great place to check out for a fast meal!!"
5646,"I'm in love with the attention that Liberty Bagels puts into their bagels!The variety of bagels offered by Liberty Bagels is truly off the chart - I honestly had a hard time figuring out which bagel to order.In the end, I ended up ordering the rainbow bagel with blueberry spread. My bagel's texture was soooo fluffy and they did not skimp on the spread at at all!"
5647,"BEST BAGELS IN MIDTOWN!It's so worth waiting in line for a freshly made bagel with loads of cream cheese. All of the flavors are really good, and the rainbow bagel cracks me up:)"
5648,"I can't believe I'm saying it, but this bagel place takes my top prize. There's not many bagel places I actively crave, but this is it. I've tried a few different bagels and a few different shmears, but the one that has stolen my heart is the asiago bagel with chipotle cream cheese combo. There's something so unique and effortlessly delicious about the salty/sweet combo of the bagel itself mixed with a spicy chipotle cream cheese blend that sings to my foodie soul. The bagels are perfectly textured, a well baked outside with a soft and fluffy middle. They also PILE on the cream cheese- which I love! Their bagels are fairly large too, so you can always save half for later!I normally order these bagels to my office when I'm in Midtown, but I've actually been in shop too because I love these bagels so much. There wasn't a line when I went, but there isn't really great options as far as dining inside. They have a few stools set up but this place does get busy so it's most likely a grab and go situation so keep that in mind. Skip the coffee, not my favorite and I feel like you can walk to another shop in the area for that if you need it. Friendly staff. Great bagel spot!!4.9/5"
5649,I was pretty dissatisfied with my visit here. Almost $10 for a bagel which wasn't warm and they barely gave me any eggs. Wouldn't come back here.
5650,"Our third and final morning bagel breakfast meal was at Liberty Bagels. The New Yorker (brisket, hash browns, eggs) sounded so good, so we ordered that on a poppy bagel ($8). It tasted just as good as it was described on the menu! Make sure to check in on Yelp to get 10% off.We got a seat at one of the two tables outside to enjoy the New Yorker. Had to watch out for random water dripping from above. Definitely another grab and go joint!"
5651,"December 2021 - COVID Review:**TLDR: Don't eat here if you have food allergies - they won't accommodate you.I really wanted to like this place and have been wanting to try an NYC rainbow bagel for forever now.... but unfortunately customer service and missing ingredients in my bagel can't justify me giving a higher rating.This was the only place out of all the food establishments that my husband and I visited during our trip that WOULD NOT accommodate my husband's nut allergies. We were ordering and out of habit and precaution, we always mention his allergies.They straight up told us to not eat there since they use the SAME KNIFE to cut all of their bagels. So that means you're gonna get some cream cheese, peanut butter, nutella, etc mixed into your bagels at some point here. That's a whole lot of cross-contamination and doesn't sound very sanitary. I get that they're busy and have an assembly line, but my husband kindly asked if they would wipe down the knife before they made his bagel to be safe and they refused. So they would rather turn away a paying customer and get a negative review than to give a good experience. I still ended up getting a novacado (nova lox with cream cheese, capers, and avocado) on a rainbow bagel since my husband didn't want me to not be able to try it. I paid close to $17(!!!) for it and it was missing the avocado! It was $17 due to everything adding up from NYC taxes, up charge for a rainbow bagel, and they charge a credit card processing fee."
5652,"Because NYC is littered with AMAZING bagel shops, my standards are set pretty high; thus, the 4 stars. I went on a Saturday morning around 8 AM and the line was already pretty long inside. I got The Bomb on an everything bagel, scallion cream cheese on a sesame bagel, and the boyfriend got the Cordon Bleu on an everything bagel as well. The bagel texture is comparable to my favorite bagel spots in east village, soft, airy and chewy but still dense. The Bomb was really delicious, that was probably the best chicken salad I've had in the city! The scallion cream cheese was not the best I've had in the city, but it was still amazing (my favorite flavor of cream cheese). All in all, if you're running to work or passing by after a night of drinking, they'll provide you with a hearty bagel that is tasty."
5653,"Nov 2021- Really what is it about NY bagels? Why do they taste so much better than any other place?I had this place bookmarked for a while (2+ since the last time I was in NYC due to the pandemic) and was finally able to check it off the list!First off, they have online ordering which is absolutely great and convenient. We were walking around near the Vessel and didn't realize how close it was. There was space to pull off to the side of the sidewalk and walk in to get our order. Because we had just placed our order and didn't know it was literally right around the block, we did wait a bit. The owner I think, an older gentleman greeted us when we came and we told him we did online ordering. He checked on it but told us they were still working on it. That was fine since it was a Sunday morning and we weren't in any rush. It was interesting to just people watch and we saw both local regulars and tourists come in and out. This place is known for their rainbow bagels so I definitely had to get that for the pics. I chose a lox salmon cream cheese spread and it was AMAZING! So creamy and the bagel was perfectly light and airy in the inside but with a nice crunch on the outside.I recommend this place- quick service, convenient, reasonable prices and quality bagels!"
5654,This place is super cute n nice. I ordered the rainbow bagel but after waiting for a while and paying for it they told me they didn't have any :/ was super bummed out they didn't have it. My brother ordered a plain bagel with cream cheese and they forgot the cream cheese on his bagel. Other then that it's not bad.
5655,Best bagels in the area. Faster service than most places too. Love the everything and pumpernickel
5656,"02/18/2022. The bagels are fantastic. Tons of bagel and cream cheese varieties to choose from. What to Expect: It can get very busy, so try to go early. When it's busy, it's chaotic, especially if you've never been before. You order in one line of the restaurant and you pay + pick up on the other side. I HIGHLY recommend you CONFIRM your order with the person who takes your order. Confirm  the bagel type, whether sandwich or plain, quantity and cream cheese type. Then when they call your name, confirm what's in the bag.I went back multiple times because I loved the bagels. But They got my order wrong each time, even after confirming. It honestly got comic towards the end. Please note, The two men at the front who takes care of the deliveries or take out were very nice. However, There were two girls who each time were responsible for a missing bagel, wrong bagel or a sassy, unnecessary comment which overall contributed to my lower rating. Here's the tea, if thirsty:I ordered in the first line, a total of two bacon egg and cheese bagels, both on an everything bagel. She confirmed two, and sent me to the next step. You don't get any sort of ticket the first line.  The second step is where they call your name and you pay. When it's chaotic, you're pretty much rushed out the way after placing your order, to the waiting area. By waiting area I mean limbo area in front of the 2nd cash register and a drink fridge. Seriously, Good luck, finding a spot when it's busy. Anyway, When they did call me, there was only one bagel. I ordered 2. When I checked the ticket, it had the number two underneath it, so I went back to ask about the second bagel sandwich. The ticket was so misleading, had both a 1 and a 2. Because I definitely ordered 2, I asked about a second sandwich. The woman went to speak with one of the people making the sandwiches. She came back and told me to ""Read the Ticket."" Haha classic NY experience. Every ticket is different, unique to different cafes all over the world. I don't work here, and there was a number 2 on it. How was I supposed to know that 2 didn't mean what I needed it to mean? The point is I ordered 2 sandwiches and I got one. So what can I do to get the second sandwich? She didn't even try to offer a solution. Just was rude about my ""ticket illiteracy"" for a bagel shop I had never been to or worked at.I could've gotten back in the first line, and complained, but I was not about to do that with a line out the door. So, my sister and I split the 1 sandwich. The next day, we tried again- lesson learned. But yes, they still got it wrong. Luckily, we aren't picky. And at least they gave us 2. Bagels deserve a 5. Service on the two girls was a one, for their execution, service and friendliness. Whenever it was that pair working the registers, they didn't give me my drinks, or they put the wrong bagel on my sandwich. It was like the girl who took my order was just picking what it sounded most like and last one just said ""read the ticket"". So rude. Anyway, the rest of the workers deserve a 5, especially the two nice guys at the front. It is chaotic and they all looked like they worked hard. Final thoughts: Go early. Enjoy the bagels, just confirm and confirm and confirm the order and look at your receipt and make sure you get what you pay for.Head's up- There is a 3.5% service fee. I tipped on top of that before she told me to ""Read the ticket."""
5657,I really liked the lox and bagel sandwich and some ways better then Best bagels.  They had a lot more variety of sandwiches but the coffee was not as good as Best bagels. Hence the 4 stars
5658,"Came here 3x in a week. The bagels are huge, pillowy, chewy, and delicious!! Their line system is a bit confusing but the food is prepared fairly quickly. Their blueberry is nicely infused into the bagel, their lox bagel tastes fresh, and bagels are warm when bought. Love love love"
5659,"Bagels, man. That's all you need to know. All different kinds of bagels available, coupled with a ton of different combinations of savory egg sandwich combos as well as sweet cream cheeses.For my first visit I selected the blueberry bagel with cinnamon walnut raisin cream cheese. While the cream cheese was a touch on the sweet side, the bagel was really chewy and held up well. I'm akin to South Jersey/Philly bagels and these NY bagels are definitely no joke.Though there was a line out the door, the staff there was friendly and were pumping out orders in a very timely manner.I'll definitely be back! Side note - if you grab your bagel and take a short walk, you're not far from the hustle and bustle of times square. Pretty cool to check out."
5660,"Famous for their beautiful rainbow bagels, this place is a must-try!We tried their rainbow bagels and their classic Nova bagel with lox. In terms of aesthetics, their bagels are showstoppers! The chewy texture of the bagels are nice, but honestly not as admirable as a nearby competitor. Counter service is fairly quick and efficient. Would return, regardless, next time we're in town!"
5661,Super disappointing!!  I ordered a pumpernickel everything bagel and a egg white omelette for pickup. I then added a decaf coffee when I was checking out. First they should have told me they don't have decaf brewed and it is going to be instant. I noticed it as she was prepping it and should have said something but I was in a hurry.  It definitely tasted like instant. bleh.The bigger disappointment was the breakfast. I was really looking forward to a fabulous pumpernickel everything bagel only to unwrap the bagel and see they gave me a jalepeno bagel instead. I am allergic to peppers so no bagel for me! the egg white omelette was ok but a bit skimpy for $8 and tasteless (not seasoned at all).
5662,"We were going to another bagel place across the street but the line was insane. There was a significant line at Liberty Bagels Midtown, but it was moving much faster. The bagel options were fun. Only small complaint I had was the flow of traffic from ordering to waiting to paying. Otherwise, a good breakfast option while in the city."
5663,"The bagels from Liberty Bagels are the truth!  Whaaaat?! How do you even get a bagel to be so soft even after toasting?  How?  Liberty's bagels sort of melt in your mouth.  I ordered a Cinnamon Raisin Bagel toasted and scooped (yes, scooped...let's minimize the carbs as best we can) with sausage, egg and cheese.  Ya'll, I cannot begin to describe the deliciousness of this bagel.  Everything was that damn good!  My daughter had a bacon, egg and cheese on a Rainbow Bagel.  The Rainbow Bagel -- aesthetically -- is so pretty! You just smile looking at it...lol.  I visit Manhattan about 2 - 3 times a year, so DEFINITELY adding this to my Manhattan rotation."
5664,"Can we talk about how delicious these bagels are??? Tucked away in midtown, liberty bagels should not be missed! I've tried their everything bagel first with vegetable cream cheese and then with avocado and herb cream cheese. The quantity of the spread is insane and the taste itself is incredible and creamy!!  The prices here are also pretty decent $5 for bagel with creamcheese"
5665,"Lox Sesame Bagel, Everything w/ plain cc, rainbow bagel w/ birthday cake cc (for fun). Wouldn't think the ""for fun"" would be the most saving note of the order. Not sure what the 4.5 stars is about, possibly just a bad experience on a busy morning but the bagels were pretty hard and didn't taste great. I've had much better in NYC (Leo's by the battery). Service 3/5, Food 2/5, Price 3/5, it's just average and not somewhere I would visit again. Not too hard to find a good bagel place in manhattan, i'd suggest trying elsewhere."
5666,"Finally got to try the NY rainbow bagels! The worker recommended the Oreo Cream Cheese when I asked for something sweet, and I really enjoyed it (though my friend found it a little too sweet). The actual bagel itself isn't super impressive and is a little pricey but worth the presentation and tourist picture. Even though there seemed to be a LOT of people waiting inside, it actually didn't take too long to order and get my bagel (~ 5-10 minutes), so don't let that deter you!"
5667,"Liberty Bagels Midtown is your classic NYC bagel shop. Famous for their rainbow/liberty bagels, this is a must try spot if you're visiting.If you're feeling sweet, I recommend their rainbow bagel with birthday cake cream cheese. Chewy, sweet deliciousness in every bite. For savory, we had their classic nova bagel (smoked salmon) on their everything pumpernickel bagel. Classic and must try, period.Overall, I'd highly recommend this place to others. We'll be back again soon!"
5668,"I was visiting New York with some friends and we knew we wanted to make sure we got bagels during our stay! Liberty Bagels caught our eye so we made our way over to the closest one to us.The Midtown location is small so long lines are inevitable. The staff does a good job about keeping it moving. They're quite nice even when busy. We each got our own bagel, but I got to split half of two different types. Here's what I got to try:Rainbow Bagel - I was worried this would be a trendy bagel that would sacrifice lewks for taste. This was not necessarily the case, the bagel stayed perfectly soft yet chewy. I did notice it was slightly more tough compared to the other bagel, but I imagine it could have been worse with all the braiding involved for the rainbow process. All things considered, this was really delightful. Peanut Butter & Nutella Cream Cheese - I was worried this would be far too sweet. While not overbearing, it was definitely decadent. I felt like I was eating a cheesecake sandwich. Delicious, but glad I only had half of an order of this. Jalapeño Bagel - I was surprised to see that the bagel itself was green. It was also actually rather spicy on its own. Soft, chewy, this made a great, savory bagel. Wish it could have been covered in a burnt-Ish cheese.Scallion Lox Spread Cream Cheese - Delicious, though I admit I wished there was more lox. Probably the sign that you should just buy the extra lox. Overall, great experience! Delicious, decadent, and delightful. Would love to go back to try more of their bagels and shmears!"
5669,Great bagels and nice place to start the day.   I got there early and they helped me before official opening
5670,"This place is a great breakfast placeService: Fairly quick to receive and process orders.Product: Bella Nova with Rainbow Bagel no capers. I just had to taste the rainbow... but in all honesty, it's just for aesthetics. The plain bagel allows you to appreciate how well everything went together: umami from the lox, sourness & saltiness from the dill cream cheese, slight bitterness from the arugula, slight kick and sweetness from the thinly slice onions, while the bagel held everything together.Highly recommended and just as good as the competitor down the street (iykyk).Pros of this place: aesthetics & a more comfortable bite (it's less lox but easier to eat)"
5671,What a fun and hospitable bagel shop in nyc! I hate to say it but I actually went to another bagel shop right before coming to this one. I was walking back to my hotel and spotted the line at Liberty Bagels and knew I needed to jump in line because of Yelp has taught me anything it's that the BEST FOOD has the longest lines! I'm glad I mustered up the extra room in my belly because OMG this is it folks.....the best bagel shop in central NYC The owner treats you at the door and is the kindest man you will ever meet with true NYC charm. Got the rainbow bagel and the confetti spread and omg my taste buds were in HEAVEN! This is absolutely a must when visiting NYC! I will absolutely be back!
5672,"You can't visit NYC without getting a bagel and boy are these delicious. Even I toasted, these bagels are so soft and fluffy. I really love the wide variety of options Liberty had to offer as well to really make it your own. Whether it's a protein alternative like tofu or egg whites, or a small dash of scallions, Liberty ensures you'll have the perfect bagel just the way you want it."
5673,Liberty Bagels came up when I entered Bagels into Yelp search today. I was looking for another Bagel Shop but this was close and had almost five stars! It's definitely old school. You enter and stay to the left in the line to order that starts way in the back. After you order they take your name and you're told to pay up front when your name is called. That's also the time you pick up your order. It's crowded in both lines so this place has a reputation. When I was handed my bag it was heavy. My Pumpernickel Everything Bagel with Bacon Scallion Cream Cheese was five dollars. They even spelled my name correctly. I stuck my bagel in my backpack and headed for the mall to find a table. This bagel is delicious. I took my time and it took me a half hour eating slow and savoring every bite! I'm recommending you visit Liberty Bagels next time you want a New York Bagel experience. They have a nice variety of bagels and cream cheese. Now you know the drill!
5674,"Disappointing. I ordered the New Yorker sandwich today on an everything wheat bagel. The NYer is brisket, egg, and hash brown and is $8.50. They put the smallest possible amount of meat on the bagel! Look at my uploaded picture. Also see that the three fillings leave a half-inch gap around the bagel. Clearly they could offer more here. The bagel itself was just so-so. It would be a good bagel if this was in the Mid-West, but NY bagels need to have a slightly crispy outside. I've had better bagel sandwiches for less."
5675,"Very close to Penn station, so very convenient to stop by before getting on / off an Amtrak. I loved the rainbow bagel, which I obviously had to get for the looks. The texture was pretty soft for a bagel that was pleasantly surprising. Sometimes bagels are too hard and tough to chew, but this was not the case. The pumpkin cream cheese also had a strong flavor and paired well with the bagel. One thing I will say though is that the rainbow bagel was in a basket with the garlic bagel? so the flavor kinda transferred in some places. Service was very fast and there were a lot of options. I will definitely be coming back again to try more things!"
5676,"Absolutely delicious!! If you are a vegan looking for a very solid bagel situation, this is for YOU. The everything bagel with vegan scallion tofu cream cheese is to die for! I can not begin to describe how much flavor that their scallion tofu cream cheese was! Usually bagel shops do not add spices into the cream cheese mix but not them. I was so excited and can not wait to have another soon! Not pictured: plain bagel with cheese, bacon, and egg. My coworker literally took that entire bagel down within three minutes. We both give this place five stars!!"
5677,"Soooo good, we got three different bagels, egg, bacon and cheese on sesame seed bagel, rainbow bagel with birthday cake cream cheese, maple bacon cream cheese on egg bagel. All delicious!"
5678,"I had breakfast here while on a quick trip to the NYC based on reviews. The previous day I had breakfast at the other bagel shop a few doors down and across the street. I ordered a cinnamon raisin bagel with vegetable cream cheese and egg whites (salty and sweet!), just like I did the day before at the other spot so I could compare the two. I really enjoyed my breakfast at Liberty Bagels but, comparatively, I liked the other place better because their bagels were tastier, softer, and they put more cream cheese on. While at Liberty Bagels I also ordered a lunch sandwich to take on the road with me. Come lunch time, I realized they got my order wrong, so that was disappointing. The menu at Liberty Bagels is pretty extensive, so try to figure out what you want before heading over. They have some fun/creative cream cheeses to try. There's 3-4 small tables with chairs outside on the sidewalk and a few stools at the entrance if you want to dine indoors."
5679,"Fast, convenient, a great spot for traditional NYC bagels! There are tons of bagel and cream cheese options to choose from!"
5680,"Best bakery in nyc, has the best variety of anytime of dessert. Great coffee and top quality!"
5681,"One of my favorite bakeries in the city. They have all your favorite bakery foods from A-Z. From many kinds of cheese cake, kinds of pies, kinds of cookies, EVERYTHING! I love how they are open late and have a nice back seat area to have some tea and cake. Good thing about this place is that the sweets aren't overalls sweet nor are the portions too large. As Goldilocks would say, ""it's just right.""Come early or late. They got what you need. Cheers"
5682,"Another unpleasant experience with this place. Stopped today to get coffee and danish. Only milk i drink is 2% or skim. Paid 7$ for coffee, and at a bar they said that they only have whole milk or half and half. I said no problem, and asked for refund! Girl said that she can not refund, bcz manager is not here and she can not call manager or owner. Is this real? 7$, can not make it and can not refund????? I had to wait for girl to go to store, to but milk and then make it:((( By the way, coffee is horrible, do not buy!"
5683,"This is one of the best bakeries in Brooklyn! Mia's always hits the spot and their talents are vast. Their cupcakes are my favorite in the area, specifically for their unique flavors like tres leches (my favorite!) and creme brulee! I will say I prefer Molly's creme brulee cupcake in the city however, if you're in the area the creme brulee cupcake here is still great. Generally I stick to cupcakes and have yet to venture out to their other desserts like pies, macaroons, and cookies. I've also tried their carrot cake milkshake and different cakes (almond, seven layer) which are deliciously moist and have great flavor! Overall, Mia's is a solid dessert spot and a must-try!"
5684,"I scoped this bakery out on Yelp and was bouncin-at-the-knees excited. Nothing could prepare me for actually being in the presence of all of these baked goods, though. TRULY as soon as you walk in, you're immediately drawn to their insane variety. Cookies, cakes, cupcakes, cheesecakes, tarts, CANNOLIS (I'm so weak for cannolis and no one in the reviews prepared me for the CANNOLIS!! That they fill fresh for you!! Regular and chocolate shells!!). It hurt me to pick, but I ended up getting a slice of blueberry cheesecake, creme brulee and tres leches cupcakes, chocolate chip cookie, rainbow cookie, and cannoli. The creme brulee cupcake and chocolate chip cookie came recommended by the person helping me and both were great! But the standouts for my family were the cheesecake, rainbow cookies, cannoli, and tres leches cupcake. So essentially everything was good. Everything. Great. No complaints. I want to go back ASAP and next time I'd love to sit down in that little area they have in the back with a cup of coffee and a slice of cake. That is when I'll know I made it. In the meantime, do yourself a favor and visit this bakery if only to breathe in that Mia's Bakery air."
5685,"It's nice to find a bakery that opens late, huh. We came here to pick a Napoleon Cake because the reviews were promising.  The staff were very nice. They carry so many sweets. Too sweet for me, except for the Napoleon Cake. Still, it was just okay. They did use fresh berries, but the custard was just okay. At least,  it wasn't too sweet. There's a doctor at work (Dr. Mikadze) whose wife made a Napoleon Cake, and I've been in search for one that is comparable to hers and every time, I failed.  She just ruined it for everyone. So, it's not Mia's fault."
5686,"OMG! Stop what your doing and go get a cupcake !!! As usual, my co-worker had told me about Mia's Bakery and how good they are, as we were talking about it, a client had jumped in and said ""yes they are amazing"". And of course I had to try it. I got the red velvet cupcake for me and the and sea salt caramel cupcake for my hubby, the red velvet was D E L I C I O U S !!  And I later update on the sea salt caramel one."
5687,"Kinda like an Italian version of Paul bakery without the real food.Items taste fresh and delicious, but be ready to fork up a pretty penny.The staff is friendly and gave me a free glass of water even though I never asked for it. It was super nice of them.I will return to get more things in the future but likely not to stock up."
5688,They have some of the best cupcakes I've ever had i my life. I order from here for work parties and everyone always raves about the cupcakes and keeps asking where I got them. They're beyond delicious and beautiful to look at!
5689,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon after our brunch and this place was absolutely wonderful. A great gem to the neighborhood that offers a plethora of delicious pastries and beverages.  The host sat us down immediately but what I like most is that she asked for my vaccine card. Huge kudos. As for the decor, this restaurant is very cozy and I absolutely loved their private patio in the back. It's all glass in the back so you can feel nature flowing. As for our waitress, she was very friendly and took care of us right away. I ordered their berry filled nepoleon and it was soooooo good. The plump berries, cream and crunch of the puff pastry confirmed that my dessert was fresh. Usually if a pastry is not fresh the berries would bleed onto the cream ans the puff pastry would be stale. More so with my dessert, I love that it was not too sweet but very cream which paired with with my coffee (unlimited cups btw). Overall, I enjoyed myself and did not feel rushed. This place is definitely my new go to spot. I would recommend going here to dine in. They are opened late and it's a good alternative if you don't feel like hitting the bar but still want to enjoy a little something-something."
5690,Hands down best cupcakes/cakes EVER!!! When walking into the bakery the aroma is just soooo enticing. Baked goods are placed delicately in cute white boxes with the company's logo. I do wish there were some sort of cupcake holder for people traveling because my cupcakes smeared in movement. They were still delicious nonetheless!
5691,Cozy and intimate spot to enjoy some delectable baked goods. This place has a huge selection so you're bound to find something you'll enjoy!I highly recommend the Napoleon (berry). You get a big portion so it's well worth the price tag. The spinach and feta pie was tasty as well with its creamy texture and savory flavors.My only complaint is that we asked for the cookie and the spinach and feta pie to be heated up but they were lukewarm when we got it. I think they would've been way better if they were fully heated through.
5692,"The owner reached out to make things right so I just wanted to update my review to note that. Understand things cannot always be perfect and going that extra mile to connect with your customers is a wonderful thing. I will also add, I have ordered many more whole cakes for birthdays and dinner parties and I will continue to be a loyal patron."
5693,"Absolutely delectable!Setting. Beautiful patisserie with indoor seating. The outdoor seating is an intimate patio space with fairy lights that illuminate the pastries.Food. Wonderful place to cleanse your palate at the end of the night.The red velvet cheesecake was everything you could ask for in a red velvet cheesecake. No comment. 5/5.Hazelnut marquise was a hazelnut mouse sprinkled with hazelnut bits. Rich and overwhelming. Wish there was something else to cut the flavor. 4/5.Spinach and feta savory pie had an crispy crust, well-seasoned interior. Too much feta for my taste but I'm not a cheese person to begin with. 4/5.Others said the blackout cake was just ""okay""Service. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.Cost: ~$5 for each item."
5694,"BLACKOUT CAKE Mia's Bakery is probably one of my favorite bakeries in Brooklyn due to their insane variety of sweets. I mean as soon as you walk in, you'll find all types of desserts making it extremely hard to decide what you really want to get!!!But if you really want something from here, definitely try their classic ""Brooklyn Blackout"" cake, which is basically chocolate sponge cake layered with chocolate custard, and then covered in chocolate frosting. It's so moist, sweet, and a must try for chocolate lovers (like me)"
5695,"I ordered the crème brûlée and fruit napoleon cake slice for delivery. Though the wait was over an hour I honestly couldn't have gotten these delicious desserts from anywhere closer to us. The wait was worth it! Absolutely delicious, fresh,  and the cake slice flakey."
5696,The best! Huge selection and I'm always happy with what I get. I love the tiramisu and key lime pie. I even went Christmas Eve to pick up cupcakes and expected a long wait and chaos and was amazed by how efficient the (very long) line was handled. I was in and out in less than ten minutes!
5697,"Pecan pie heaven!! Mia's dessert repertoire is obviously large based on the large cases filled with sweets, but I came after reading a review about how the pecan pie is not too sweet, but filled w lots of nuts over a buttery crust. Ordering on the last Friday of October, I called and asked if there were any whole pies available for purchase and was told I could submit an online order for pick up after 4pm (the website requests 24hr advance orders). Ecstatic, I put in my order and it was ready to pick up by 4!The pie was aesthetically pleasing (aka it didn't look like a mess from above) and on the subway ride back, I broke one corner of pie crust lol The pie itself was exactly as I had read! Crust was a solid and buttery crust (not flakey). It wasn't flooded with pecans, but there were plenty in each slice. There was still a custard-ish layer beneath the nuts, but it wasn't cloyingly sweet and it wasn't that sticky/thick texture that gets stuck between teeth. Pecan pies are typically crazy sweet and I feel like I'm shoving spoonfuls of sugar with each bite, but this indeed was a much better experience! Still tastes dessert, but I didn't wince due to the sweetness of each bite lolWas very happy to have found this pie and would definitely buy it again! Not sure if you can order for pick up at the 7th Ave shop, but the Brooklyn location was an easy subway ride for me."
5698,It looks better than it tastes. I have a huge sweet tooth and I was very tempted to walk in and buy something. I ended up choosing the Nutella cake and am sad to report that it tasted very little like nutella. The cake was also very heavy. Not really my type. Won't come here again but give it a try! It's inexpensive.
5699,"I was in the area and noticed this bakery as I was walking by. Holy cow were there A LOT of options! My sister and I picked 5 slices of cake to share with our family. We picked red velvet, Oreo, lemon/blueberry, tiramisu, and strawberry shortcake.They were all so delicious! First off, the slices were huge. The cake was moist but no dense. Instead, it was fluffy! I particularly LOVED the lemon/blueberry and tiramisu because the flavors were on point and didn't taste artificial. My least favorite was the red velvet because it was too sweet for my liking.Give this place a try!! The staff was great and patient! It's a little out of my way but I'll for sure visit again."
5700,Stopped by for yummy pastries and lattes. The tea latte was light and frothy. The pasty was fire.
5701,"Cake so nice, I had to have it twice! I got a slice of chocolate and came back later in the week for a rainbow cake as I couldn't get it out of my mind (ok I also forgot my credit card here so I had to come back, but completely unrelated). They do a lot of take out, but there's a beautiful patio in the back that is pretty easy to get seating at and makes you feel like you're outside of the city and removed from it all."
5702,8000 options and they're all good!Definitely worth the visit.Kind staff as well.Take a shot.
5703,The banana bread pudding was just the perfect after dinner dessert.  It wasn't overly sweet and had nice chunks of banana that you could actually taste.  The only downside to Mia's is that the service is extremely slow.  The last few times I've been there we always have to flag down a server to order.
5704,"The burnt almond cake is SOOOO GOOD. You can just tell it's high quality and it's v rich in flavor. I only tried a slice, but on a special occasion I'd def get a whole cake :3 I also tried the creme brulee cupcake, but it traveled 6 hours with me at room temperature and then was left overnight in the fridge so I can't judge it properly lol.They're also being relatively safe about covid, allowing only 5 people in at a time. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in Brooklyn!!"
5705,"Picked up a couple of things for a Sunday night treat and it was good. Nothing exceptional but not bad either. The salted caramel cheesecake was a little too dense for my liking but the cheesecake itself was a great balance of sweet and tangy. Didn't get much of the salted caramel flavor but it was overall a good tasting piece of cheesecake. The Nutella Delight cake was not as rich as I expected it to be based on all the other reviews I had read. The chocolate sponge is light and airy, the Nutella mousse is tasty but I wish the buttercream frosting was more chocolatey. Overall, good desserts but nothing really stood out about either one that I tried. Will check out the other offerings to see how they fare."
5706,"I have been coming to Mia's for years. I have introduced many friends and family members to this place also. The stuff is always good, staff is friendly and patient when you are trying to decide on what treat you should indulge in. The funny thing is I don't live anywhere close to this place. I use to work close by but that was years ago . But now my family I travel to get a treat."
5707,"While Mia's bakeries cake taste amazing I've been ordering from them for many years. Their prices have gone up but their customer service and ordering system has dramatically decreased. I ordered a cake for 2pm pickup 24 hours in advance. I arrived after 3:30 to pick up the cake. The cake was not ready, the gentleman behind the counter asked if the cake was supposed to be written on. I placed the order online and it has this information. I placed the order online so I could be in and out of the bakery and not standing inside waiting on my order(COVID). Had I wanted to want an additional 20-30 minutes I would've came in and ordered it on the spot. They need to be more efficient with keeping up with their online orders."
5708,"Mia's Bakery is such am amazing place with vegan and none vegan options that taste amazing.  The staff and owners are always kind and very helpful.  With lots  options available everyone can fine what they want here.  We have ordered and picked up so many baked goods from here and always happy.  Simple cakes, decorative, fancy you name they can do it.  There have been lots of cakes over the yrs. Mia's has made us very happy."
5709,"Ordered a Black Forest birthday cake for my wife. According to her, it was good but on the sweet side. Her favorite here was the mini fruit tart which was one of the best she had. Also bought a creme brûlée cupcake and rainbow cookies. The rainbow cookies seemed on the expensive side ($20 per pound) but they were definitely worth it. Just the right amount of filling. Hmm there's so many things I'll need to try here in the future."
5710,"So this place is my new addiction. After my 1st order I couldn't stop craving the yummy goodness, I had to have more. One things for sure I'll always get the lemon/coconut cupcake it's my favorite, but now I have more favorites. Let's see... Creme Brûlée cupcake: if you're ever undecided on weather have a cupcake or creme brûlée this is for you. It's a marriage made in heaven. Moist cupcake with the flavor of creme brûlée that's not too sweet, along with fresh fruit on top.  It took me to dessert heaven. Red Velvet cupcake: the perfect moist cake with not too sweet frosting (I hate too sweet frosting, but this one I finished). Nutella Delight Cake: I'm not a big chocolate fan, but I was curious to try it out.  this cake was sinfully good. Moist cake, with hazelnut and pops of crunch. It was a party in my mouth. Banana Pudding:  it's not my favorite. It was too thick for my liking. ‍"
5711,"Whatever you order from Mia's bakery , you will love.  Everything is fresh and delicious.  And service is exemplary  and I mean that.  I order online as I am incapacitated, and within the hour, the order has arrived."
5712,"Two words ! The cheesecake. #dropsmic ‍No but really I've been longing for some cheesecake and Mia's did not disappoint. I had the Apple and pumpkin. Yes I had to get both and literally SO GOOD! I did also try the Boston Creme cupcake. That was just ok. But I'm telling you if you like cheesecake, try Mia's."
5713,I must say this bakery has the best rainbow cookies I've ever tasted. To follow upThey also have the best tres leches cupcakes in New York in my opinion. If you visit them these are their must try! Definitely worth the trip
5714,"This place was hopping' & I can see why.  Gourmet desserts galore, macaroons were delicious, coffee by Brooklyn Roasting company.  I even ordered off of Yelp courtesy of GrubHub for an after 10pm treat.  If you're in Brooklyn, this is a must stop"
5715,"Mia's Bakery. Thank you, thank you for helping this new mom out! As someone who doesn't often order custom cakes, I didn't realize how far in advance a cake must be ordered- which was almost quite the disaster! Fortunately, the team at Mia's was able to squeeze me in, and save our little mini- gathering for my son's first birthday. They not only whipped up a strawberry shortcake with terribly short notice, they customized it to my request with perfect execution in time for our little celebration. And then, there's the cake itself. Aside that it was a beautifully decorated cake - it was delish! So fresh, and so tasty. It may be  easy to impress a one year old, but not as easy to impress me. Seriously, I'm notoriously picky. I was SO impressed! Bottom line, Mia's is a neighborhood gem, and their customer service is amazing. If you need a custom cake, give them a call (and give them a bit more notice than I did!) :)"
5716,Such a lovely bakery with a cute outdoor area. We popped in on a snowy Saturday while running errands and ordered the lava cake. Perfect sweet treat. They have a lot of desserts to choose from. A few family members have ordered from them on special occasions.
5717,Came here on my birthday during covid. Indoor dining is open with social distancing. Always busy! I wanted the blackout cake which is my fav but my husband got the Black Forest! Haha A for effort. Didn't really like it- but not the point. Just not a personal fav. Obviously they'll write happy birthday on the plate for you. Love it. I usually come here for all my cake/bakery needs. I always get their fruit tarts!  Basic coffee/drink selection. But I think it's overall worth the price. Love their backyard in the warmer months.Cake + iced latte + hot chocolate = $20 w/o tip
5718,If I could give less stars I would. I had my 6lb little dog in a covered bag on my shoulder. The server was so sweet taking my order when this tall gentleman seated at one the tables jumped up and refused to serve me because I had my dog in the bag. He screamed and yelled at me and acted in such an ugly  un professional manner . He threw my purchase behind the counter not allowing me to Purchase my dessert. I protested saying I would be gone momentarily. To please allow me to payBut he continued to shout and yell and acted extremely aggressively towards me. His actions were not only un professional but very frightening. No human being with a dog or without a dog should be treated in such an ill manner
5719,"Nice, quaint place. Servers sat us down immediately and fielded plenty of questions I had about their pastries and drinks. Even warned me when I almost ordered a drink much smaller than most. Would definitely reccomend for a quick coffee, a casual date, or getting a bit of reading done."
5720,Been coming here for years - this review is long overdue! Will come back a million times !!
5721,"The desserts are great , the prices are not high what's so ever , the hot chocolate is amazing . Definitely coming back here with my gf , she as well liked it ."
5722,"Yup. Everything you've read about this place is true. Literally couldn't ask for better desserts. I live unfortunately but fortunately about 5 mins away from Mia's so it is almost impossible to not stop by for a sweet treat! I also have found that they have partnered with reducing food waste app, Too Good To Go, and sell heavily discounted bag of goodies at the end of the night. You have to reserve your bag on the app but be on alert because they sell out FAST!!!!"
5723,"I'm came here to purchase a birthday cake for my significant other. I am on a journey to shed some pre and post Covid weight, so I haven't had any type of sweets in two months. Upon entry, I probably stared at the glass for probably five minutes because so many things looked good and I didn't know what to do with myself, lol.An employee came over shortly thereafter, I informed her I needed a few minutes to decide. She was very patient with me, I did opted to just get a few cake slices rather than have leftover cake and a lot of temptation. I opted for the cheesecake for the original cheesecake, the rainbow cake and a suggestion of the employee, which I believe was the breakthrough--she told me it was her best seller amongst chocolate lovers. We both were enamored with how great the slices were here. Very rich in flavor and thickness, but not overly sweet. I appreciated everything about this place. They only allow five patrons in a time, how helpful the employee was (I literally asked a million questions), the layout of the store, etc..I'd recommend this place to anyone with a sweet tooth or looking to indulge for their cheat day meal."
5724,"My mother is a saint who happens to click on every ""top this or that"" list that pops up. Well, I'm glad she did this time. Mia's was the best bakery in NY, according to whatever list she was viewing. I'll go further: it was the best I've ever been to. Get a table. Order an Americana. Then overload on treats. We got the blackout cake, pecan pie and the banana cream pie. The banana cream is so outlandishly good I can hardly believe it actually was real. I used to think Rocco's was the mountain top. Nope, Mia's. Go. Run!"
5725,This place lives up to the hype and good yelp reviews. It was packed for good reason so we sat outside where the tables are more distanced. Our desserts looked good and were amazing.  I would definitely go back and am keeping it bookmarked.
5726,"This bakery is a dessert lover's dream! It has so many pastries lined up and glistening on display that it makes it so hard to get just one item. I came by to pick up a cake for my friend's birthday and someone helped me right away. I hadn't put in an order online, but was happy that they had the cake I wanted available on the spot. I ordered an 8 inch carrot cake and it came out to be $41, which I thought was very reasonable. The only downside was that you do have to pay for candles and even the cutting knife. They had some issues with their credit card machine that day which made the checkout process kind of long, but they apologized for the wait. My friends and I enjoyed the carrot cake! It was slightly too sweet for my taste, but still enjoyable. The layers of the cake were thick and very worth the price. I would recommend stopping by to satisfy your sweet tooth! The staff was very friendly and the items are fairly priced and worth the value. I believe they have outdoor seating in the back if you wanted to dine in as well."
5727,"This lovely bakery is bigger than expected with its ample seating inside and out, I was a little disappointed to see the back patio not open for customers. Nonetheless the treats taste just as good at home- or on your way there, if your anything like me and cannot stand to have such baked goodness waiting around for too long. With tons of options to choose, from the freshly baked XL cookies to vegan chocolate hazelnut cake you really can't go wrong. We opted for a lemon bar, Italian rainbow cookies & a almond croissant. The lemon bar and rainbow cookie were my favorite. Moist, chewy, & delicious. The lemon bar, tart yet sweet with flecks of coconut gave it a slight tropical yet extremely bright flavor. The Italian cookie moist from each layer sandwiched between jam, nutty and fruity. The almond croissant was huge! But nothing too special aside from that."
5728,Those best bakery in all of Brooklyn and probably anywhere. This place has EVERYTHING. Wide variety of any kind of pastry / cookie / cake you can imagine. And it's all sooo good. This chocolate chip cookies are to die for. Cute place to bring a date too.
5729,"*COVID takeout*Huzzah, I finally went to Mia's! For once, the cake is as good as it looks, and she looks fine!Although they didn't have the burnt almond cake I was craving, I got a slice of chocolate cheesecake, and WOW. She's a fat layer of New York cheesecake stacked between rich chocolate buttercream and moist chocolate cake. You have to go slow with this one, and yes, it is on the sweet side for my minuscule sweet tooth; however, the phenomenal quality gives me every confidence that when I finally get my slice of burnt almond, it is going to slay.It's not if I'm coming back, it's when..."
5730,"Lovely service, good food. We had a pasta with short rib Ragu - good/heavy as expected. The pasta was well prepared. We split the fried cod main - it came with olives which were not specified on the menu. The cod itself was perfectly cooked. We also had the brussel sprout appetizer - well prepared but a bit sweet."
5731,"Del Posto light would be a term that I'd like to describe Lupa except I've never been to Del Posto. (Del Posto is on my bucket list) We're trying to get back to normalcy, it's been a challenge in 2020. Hopefully, murder hornets aren't coming back anytime soon. Arrojo in Tribeca is open again so my wife & I came into NYC for her haircut and dinner. Nick Arrojo mentioned to me a few months ago that we should try Lupa. I'm told it's one of his favorite spots and the Saltimbocca is amazing. Interesting, Saltimbocca means ""jumps into the mouth"". Yeah, I'm down with anything jumping into ma belly. We walk a few blocks to Lupa. I see there is outdoor dining on the sidewalk. I have a reservation and we're seated at an outdoor table. Looking at the menu choices, everything looks amazing. I also must point out, I am a total fan of Joe and Lidia Bastianich. I read Restaurant Man so I'm jazzed to dine here. The first thing I'd like to try is the Bastianich wines. It sounds a little kookie that a guy from Queens now has a wine label but after seeing him on TV and taking no nonsense, I know he demands perfection. My wife & I both order a glass of white and red Bastianich wine. Very impressed, my red was silky smooth. We also shared the Fritto Misto, which is lightly fried Calamari, Artichoke and Fennel. Fennel? Very Roman and very decadent. The wait staff, they have their hustle on. They're constantly at our table asking if everything is ok. What they don't have is Saltimbocca. Damn you 2020! Not a problem, we'll order our standard meal.My wife & I have an ordering system at any Italian restaurant. No one over 40 needs to be eating a huge bowl of pasta. I'd like to have the chef spilt the pasta dish into two bowls. So now we both have a taste and boy did we taste. The Bolognese Tagliatelle we ordered was insane. Do you think Joe Bastianich will allow boxed pasta with his wine label? His mom would whack him with the wooden spoon! Freshly made Tagliatelle tossed in rich bolognese sauce, I can honestly say this was probably the best bolognese I ever had.Ever.We also ordered Branzino. Kudos to the chef, they were able to get the skin crispy and the flesh very moist. Branzino is a Mediterranean Sea fish, I can picture when Jesus said ""Throw out your net on the right-hand side of the boat"" that net was filled with Branzino. Just a perfect choice to a perfect meal. This is off their website: LUPA is a fun downtown trattoria with a warm and welcoming atmosphere.I couldn't agree more."
5732,"Holy cow! Never seen a place fall so darn hard. Went 2 years ago and this place was great with great staff. Now this is 3rd or 4th rate staff, like really bad especially Ismael who appears to be disgruntled that he has to wait tables despite being a bar tender. Rude unhelpful and I thankful sums up ismael really well. The food matched the service. They are essentially serving slop pasta, had two pasta dishes and man were they so amateur it's not funny. It was sad being there Bc of how bad this place is right now, just don't go makes no sense so many better places."
5733,The most amazing charcuterie and bread! I would come and just get the focaccia as a snack. Very well known for the carbonara (with good reason!) Divine
5734,"Great food with shit service and no ambiance.If you live close, I recommend you get take away lol. But even so they sometimes miss take away order so when you to pick up, it might not even be ready bc they didn't know if you placed an order. Need a serious management makeover-"
5735,"To be quite honest, Alio Olio was nothing good.Just tasted oil only...Too much out of my high expectations..."
5736,"We had a 9 pm reservation but ended up coming an hour early and grateful they seated us on a busy saturday evening!! The place was definitely bustling. We started with a shareable app of squash blossoms topped with anchovies, very good. We then each got the pasta special with chanterelles. Pasta was perfectly cooked Al dente but it was overall on the salty side (and this is coming from me who likes salt). The chanterelles were delightful, wonderful flavor and freshness. We ended sharing a cinnamon gelato and it was surprisingly light and a great finish to the heavy meal. They definitely know how to do their pastas well but recommend they cut down on the salt a bit."
5737,"I ordered take-out from this restaurant, it was decent!! We ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara with black pepper - similar to others it was definitely pretty good cause it was simple. It had some simple cheese sauce that covered the noodles was just perfect honestly. Not too heavy or too thin, it was a great compliment.Braised Oxtail with gnocco - was good, really wished there was more meat, hehe, but honestly it was a good dish.Bucatini all Amatriciana - was decent as well. I really enjoyed the thickness of the noodles with the sauce. I felt like honestly, the noodles might be homemade since it was perfect so chewy - and had a great bite!! Would definitely recommend to dine-in, I think take-out isn't as great compared with the flavors and texture from eating it ""fresh"" from the kitchen."
5738,"This place never disappoints. They stick to classic Roman dishes and pasta is always fresh. The flavor of their passata is the perfect base to create pasta amatriciana or a simple gnocchi al pomodoro. Last time we went, we had 2 specials: Ragu di Cinghiale and pasta nero di seppia. They were both delish and cannot wait to go back again."
5739,"Lupa was a highlight of my trip to NY. The food was amazing, priced well, and of high quality. But more importantly, the staff made my visit incredible. The waiter was friendly and we were able to talk to the chef from Italy. The desert at the end was very special: tiramisu in a bialetti espresso machine."
5740,Unfortunately both me and my girlfriend had food poisoning within 2 hours of dining here. I suspect the water we were served was contaminated. Food was ok but definitely not as great as alternatives with lesser reputation. They recently switched a chef which might be the issue. Service was fine.
5741,"My wife and I recently visited NYC and had an excellent experience at Lupa. One thing that stood out is how personable the wait staff was. Ours was great, but you could see everyone in the restaurant engaging with their waiter/waitress with questions about the menu or specials or wines or deserts. It made for an enjoyable experience. Of course the food was superb. My linguine and clams was amazing and my wife moaned over her pasta dish. Just an overall excellent experience."
5742,"waiting orders for hours. Burrata was not fresh at all. The bread can tell you this restaurant is far from good Italian food. Pasta was fine . Honestly, not good overall."
5743,"Do not go there for restaurant week!!!Tiny portions!! I ordered crostino rapini with egg. The bread was burnt but crunchy. Shockingly this was the best part of the meal. I ordered fettuccine with acciuga butter- it was wayyyyy too salty. Worst pasta I had this year. I then ordered pork porterhouse. It came with five tiny pieces of pork. The pork was so lean and extremely blend. I also got my secondi 30 minutes after my primi. Service was mediocre. Even though there were 4-5 servers, they were busy talking to themselves. I would not come back."
5744,"If you have read any of my reviews, you would know that I am a carb and Italian restaurant whore. It's true. There is practically no pasta that I won't devour. Came to Lupa to check out restaurant week's fixed menu and it did not disappoint. For about forty bucks (give or take) I had a three course meal. Started with a veggie crostini, than had a fettuccini followed by a pork dish. Because it was a special menu, the portions were smaller than normal. I saw many customers sitting nearby happily devouring large bowls of what appeared to be delicious pastas.  While service was very friendly, it was slow. The place was packed so it was understandable. Additionally, it felt like a long afternoon in Italy where you could eat, drink, and enjoy the company of friends at a leisurely pace. Would not recommend coming here on a first date or with someone who you don't enjoy spending time with for that reason."
5745,"Went here for my birthday dinner and had an incredible time! The atmosphere is dimly lit and cozy. The som was quite helpful in recommending a wine, which we loved and was exactly what we were looking for. The appetizers and entrees were flavorful and well portioned. We were so full by the end but still managed to save room for dessert. Highly recommend!"
5746,"Salt bomb alert!!!  Man, the food here was so salty.  We didn't sleep well that night after dinner because we were so dehydrated and thirsty.  We do generally like our food well salted but this was off the charts salty.The meal started out hopeful enough. The crostini white bean purée was fine (perhaps even under salted!) and the focaccia was a perfect bite.  We sipped our well made cocktails and devoured the chicken liver pâté (so amazing, I loved the acidic raisins).  We ordered the Roman Pasta tasting - 4 pastas + dessert.  That night it was Bavette Cacio e Pepe, Spaghetti alla Carbonara with Pepper, Bucatini All'Amatriciana, and Mezzi Rigatoni with Pajata Finta and Ricotta.  We started out with a pasta with short rib (they accommodate one substitute, we opted out of cacio e pepe) and it was delicious.  The carbonara was very salty (not unbearably so) but the last two each were saltier than the next and we eventually had to stop eating.  On a positive note, the pasta was perfectly al dente.  For dessert, we expressed interest in the tartufo and the server offered to exchange our two sorbets for it - a welcomed surprise!I've been to Lupa several times over the years.  I've typically had a top notch experience.  I love the rustic vibe, service is always friendly, and food had generally been amazing.  This last time certain dishes didn't live up to the Lupa reputation, perhaps just an off night for the kitchen.Many props to our waitress and servers for their friendly and attentive service.  They're so nice, accommodating, and eager to please."
5747,"The food was good, the music was awesome, but unfortunately the service wasn't good. A few things: 1) sat us 15 minutes after reservation even though we all showed up on time 2) they forgot one of our appetizers, 3)asked if we wanted another bottle of wine and then forgot it, 4) ran out of cheese (how does an Italian restaurant run out of cheese), 5) took for ever to bring check and then grab check. Tbh I'm convinced our waiter was stoned, he looked confused a couple times. Again decent spot and if you have a good waiter probably a great spot"
5748,"Best pasta I've ever had. I'll be dreaming of the al dente heaven for years to come. We ordered the squid ink, clams and cacio e pepe pasta. All delicious. Wine offering good, if a little overpriced (more than the usual upcharge). The restaurant has a nice feel, intimate and cozy. One star off for service... generally good but a little pretentious and we had three different waiter when we were there which was strange."
5749,"My boyfriend has been meaning to take me here since my birthday in November. Glad it didn't happen for a special occasion. I would have been pissed having my birthday dinner here. The service sucks here!! Also, I understand NYC has ended social distancing and Covid restrictions, but there's still a lethal virus. Our table of 2 was basically a table of 4 and we had to sit right next elbow to elbow to another couple. Remove some tables!! Y'all have an outdoors space too. The place was super crowded. The food was average at best. Crispy chicken was uneventful and black truffle pasta was blah. The bartender was nice to make me an Aperol Spritz because they didn't have watermelon to make the watermelon fizz listed on their menu."
5750,I was very clear with my waiter that I want my steak hot. I got cold steak !Done with that place....
5751,"TLDR: Overall, I would highly recommend Lupa - great pasta, great ambiance, and friendly staff. Just steer away from the crispy cod. Food (4/5) - Let's start with what everyone wants to hear about. My girlfriend and I ordered the burrata to start. It was creamy, moist, and delicious - everything that you would want from a burrata. Surrounding the burrata were some caramelized nuts that added a nice crunch along with some sweetness. For our next course (Primi), we split the Strozzapreti. This dish was heaven. The sauce was rich and cheesy. The pasta was perfectly al dente. The meat was moist and delicious. My one very minor gripe with this dish was that the meat was a little bit tougher than I would've liked. I'm used to dishes with short ribs being incredibly tender. But all-in-all, still very, very delicious. For our penultimate course (Secondi), we ordered the crispy code. This dish was pretty disappointing. The primary issue was that it way too salty. Additionally, the spicy tomato and onion, while good, didn't really compliment with the fish. For me, it didn't really feel like a cohesive dish. To finish the meal, we ordered the tartufo. I'd never heard of this dessert before but after we devoured it, my girlfriend aptly described it as a ""giant ice cream ferrero rocher."" Chocolate, ice cream, and hazelnut - what's not to love?Service (5/5) - Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. He walked through all the dishes with us and gave recommendations on portion sizes. I genuinely felt that he wanted us to have a good experience. Also, extra points to him because he ran after us when I forgot our leftover crispy code (although I kind of wish I had just forgotten it). Ambiance (4/5) - I really enjoyed the style of this restaurant, especially the brick arches in the back. Unfortunately, it was a bit loud. One thing to note, the seating is a bit cramped - you feel like you're almost elbow to elbow with other patrons. On the other hand, it kind of lends to the charm of the restaurant."
5752,Lovely and delicious Roman food on quiet Greenwich Village street. Ismael and Kevin are wonderful bartenders and the food is top notch!
5753,"Be warned: the service here is pretty bad! If the food weren't so good this would easily be a one star restaurant. The sad part was it was my birthday and I was hoping for a spectacular experience!We saw our waiter 3 times the entire meal. To take our order, once while eating and then when we got the check. We got the pasta tasting menu and they brought our food out so sporadically. Our first 3 came out within 5 mins of each other and then the last 3 had a 20 minute gap between each dish. It was really frustrating rushing through 3 course and then having the rest come out so slowly. You might be thinking the wait is nice for digesting, but the restaurant was so hot! It was like the AC was broken. I had to take layers off and I was still sweating. After the first 3 courses I was full and sweating. Not a great combination... It really ruined the last 3 dishes. If you notice I only have 3 pictures because I was so turned off I stopped recording the meal. Tonnarelli Cacio e Pepe - really good. great pepper flavorsRicotta Gnocchi with Sausage & Fennel - gnocchi's cooked perfectly and went really well with the sauceBucatini All'Amatriciana - flavors were amazing!Spaghetti alla Carbonara - really good and creamy. simple dish done really well. Pajata Finta - rigatoni was cooked well and once again great flavorsSorbetto - great pallet cleanser. Very simple. They threw a candle in there for my birthday, but on point with their poor service they gave it to the wrong person. So food probably 5 stars. Service definitely 1 star."
5754,"Lupa is a scrumptious restaurant that makes your mouth water! The lemonade is very sour, but is delicious! It belches bubbles at the top, and is filled with freezing cubes of ice. Also they add a lemon, which is the perfect touch. Their Fava Bean Crostini, fills a heavenly, toasted crostini, with the beans make it very soft plus crunchy. Try it, and enjoy it! Lupa's bread dough is fluffy, with the crust easy to bite into! Mmm... Lupa's fingerling potato's are sooo good! The spicy ioli just brings out its heavenly flavor. Octopus. I DO NOT LIKE THEIR OCTOPUS! First, it is way to chewy! Second, it has NO flavor! I personally do not recommend this! If you enjoy Italian cuisine, trust me- you'll adore this restaurant!"
5755,"We enjoyed the Italian cuisine!  We ate in the back room area that was festively decoWe did not know what we should order but took a chance and picked some of the items other revivers loved too.  I loved the short rib ragu. The gnocchi stuff with ricotta was my friend's favorite. We both loved the Fresh pasta dish (bravette cacio e Pepe). We took a chance on trying the special of the day - wild boar!  It was and interesting experience.  The cut of meat was thick and cooked just to done!  It was tasty . Though we were quite full from the delicious meal, we had to try a dessert or two. Tartufo (definitely  for chocolate lovers)!and olive oil cake.   Loved the experience and would come back.  The staff was friendly and did not run you to finish."
5756,"One of the best Italian restaurants I've been to in New York! The menu was full of interesting choices, while also having all the classic dishes you would expect, and contained a full glossary on the back to help sort through it all.The by the glass wine menu was a bit short but it seemed like if you were buying by the bottle there was a more extensive menu.The food was amazing and the portions felt reasonable, if not generous. the service was very hospitable, and prices in line with what you'd expect; around $20 for pasta and around $30 for an entree. It was a little loud at times but in general a nice atmosphere."
5757,"We came for my husband's birthday dinner. He has been here many times in the past and has always had a positive experience. Same with this night. We started with a delicious chef's amuse touch of white bean puree on a crispy toasted baguette. We shared some appetizers - burrata with carrot, maple and chili, beets with stracciatella, hazelnut and cranberry, citrus marinated sardines with ceci fritti, and a basket of focaccia. All were stellar items and would order them all over again. I think the beets though were my absolute favorite.I ordered the honeynut squash mezzeluna with hazelnut and brown butter ($21). This was a mistake on my part. It was okay - but just not at the level that I was hoping for. Portion wise though - it was huge and I did eat the whole plate so it wasn't like it wasn't good. He had the carbonara ($20), and loved it. Perfectly executed classic dish. Prices on our pasta dishes were incredibly reasonable for NYC. Customer service was attentive and friendly. Plus the vibe here was nice and warm. Not stuffy - lots of big groups of people getting together. Great people watching opportunities here. Overall nice evening in Greenwich Village."
5758,"Heavy heart one star:(We have been dining at this restaurant for at least 18 yrs and one of our quintessential nyc dining recommendations to friends. We had an ""off"" night previously and, of course,  gave them another chance out of loyalty from our numerous previous experiences. It is just simply terrible food, terrible service and the manager Beatrice is an embarrassment. As an Italian restaurant you ought to be able to cook pasta!  It was raw and steps below al dente, both the first time they served it and the ""recook""second attempt; the octopus entree was tough and cold. It's sadly an era gone and highly recommend a host of other amazing Italian restaurants in nyc such as Via Carota or Dell'Amina. So sad."
5759,Honestly the worst service I have received in NYC in the past 10 years. We came for a company lunch and waited almost 3 hours for our main course. There is no way that the standard of food is worth this wait.I recommend going any where else to get a decent Italian dish.
5760,"First time in the city since March, and struck gold - Lupa reopened for outdoor dining on Mondays. Our favorite restaurant, period, made everything right again, if only for 90 minutes. Thompson Street, tree-lined and dark but for the dots of string lights and the glow of the Carbone sign, was bustling on Monday, breathing life into at least one Gotham neighborhood. The seating was limited of course, but perfectly fine. Started with the flawless Negroni, followed by an escarole salad big enough to share. As much as I try, I rarely can resist Lupa's sublime cacio e Pepe. It remains a 4 ingredient miracle. Thee evening's revelation however was the crispy cod, served on top of rich, complex tomato sauce and sweet, grilled chipollini onions. Perfectly cooked, moist and flakey, it is the best fish dish I've had in years. I considered requesting a soup bowl of the tomato sauce to go, but really, let's save it for my next visit.The staff doesn't have it easy, having to dance between pedestrians with hot plates, speaking through masks over a thumping car stereo 3 feet away, but somehow it works. I miss the belly-up to the bar for a new amaro suggestion, and I miss....well, I miss ""the old us."" But somehow the push to the streets have returned places like Lupa to the authentic atmosphere of their Trastevere sidewalk roots. And I hope that when things do get back to normal, they get to keep some of that parking space real estate."
5761,I am really disappointed by them this time.  I used to like Lupa a lot.  1.  Covid case is going up.  The tables insides the restaurant is jammed packed.  I really do not expect Lupa would set up so many tables inside the restaurant.2.  Staff do not wear face mask.  3.  Came with 3 other people.  I have one of my friends who wanted to try pasta tasting.  They do not want to accommodate.  They said the chef does not know how to accommodate.
5762,"Hopping! We had reservations for a late seating on a rainy Saturday night and the place was filled. Service was quick and attentive. She started with a couple of delicious cocktails (An Italian Mule and Aperol Spritz. Both delicious, not too sweet. Can't say that about the Manhattan that followed, tho!)  it tasted like a liquid cough syrup. Waaay too heavy on the cherry syrup. The buratta and Baccala Salad were both strong.  Very flavor and perfect blend of flavors.  The cod is salted in house and was tender, large chunks and served cold.  Buratta was velvety and a perfect consistency for the matched peas toasted peppers and vegetables that accompanied it.  We had two pastas, the linguine with clam sauce and a black (squid ink) penne with seafood. Both were excellent but a bit on the salty side.  The pastas were very fresh and tasty, high quality.   The dishes are meant to be eaten w pieces of everything the chef puts inside because the flavors blend and support each other.  By the time our Branzini main and garlic-and-farro side arrived was totally stuffed. But the fish is filleted w the head and tail on laid on a bed of sauce and asparagus. It was tasty. The faro was lacking in flavor but again when blended w the fish it added texture and gained support, but could do without it.  Overall, good meal and great ambiance for a Saturday night out. Probably overpriced for the misses on some of the dishes. I think if I returned would go for bar for drinks and just try out their pastas."
5763,Lupa was some of the best Italian food my girlfriend and I have had in a while! We both ordered Cacio e Pepe and it was delicious. The place we pretty busy but our waiter was very nice and the service overall was excellent. They also had an amazing selection of wines to choose from.
5764,"First trip to NYC since covid and wanted to do it right. Lupa was a great start with a top notch meal simple, great pasta. Covid precautions with some plastic barrieres also kept noise down!"
5765,Food was delicious and the restaurant felt cozy! We had a good time and good food. We will definitely go back again.
5766,"5/5 ambience , music, noise levels, the story of Remus and remulus: #Rome5/5 service and friendliness and knowledge of menu5/5 accommodating and attentive service ^^ I can't emphasize this enough ; I would usually focus on the food but Lupas service was Michelin level with a dash of Italian love for food, seasoned with familial friendliness Our server was Ben at the bar and not only did he describe all items in detail down to the ingredients but he also made sure that being Muslim, our Halal pescatarian preferences were thoroughly respected. Apparently Lupa puts your dietary restrictions on their ticket and the kitchen is super mindful and will customize some dishes- which brings me to the food:The meal started with a complimentary crostini which was good. Set the mood for festivities though; the bread app was rosemary encrusted and was served like a warm focaccia with great olive oil Next came the fluffiest creamiest lightest summer burrata with heirloom tomatoes and watermelon ! Top 2 in the City ; The ricotta gnocchi was customized without the meat in the fennel tomato sauce while retaining its hand cut pasta goodness.My fav was the papparedelle with morel mushrooms Whig are usually hard to find hot hacr been thriving with all the forest fires in California ( silver lining ) my friends called it a ""Stairway to heaven ""Considered the truffle pasta but it was end of truffle season so we opted against it. The only star I took away was because of the tagliette Nero - squid ink shrimp pasta dish which I literally found hard to eat but take that with a. Grain of salt since I don't like it when one can literally "" taste the ocean"" in ones food. Too much squid ink and somehow didn't work with the sun dried tomatoes and lemon aftertastes imoThe cacio de pepe bavette was a classic oldRoman dry dish, done classically well in all its simple flavors. The parmigiana was perfectly aged and the blackpeppercorn complemented it wonderfully"
5767,New chef- DONT GO HERE!! Apparently the talent has left the building. They had a new chef for the last few weeks and all he does is put red pepper over a bunch of recipes he obviously does not know how to make!! Biggest disappoint!!
5768,Disappointed.  Service was ok and the food was underwhelming.  Hummus crostini was unseasoned. Plain chick pea paste.  Focaccia was like cake and not very savory. The chicken liver crostino was too salty. Asparagus was good.  The crispy pork belly and pork chop special was bland and a little dry despite all the fat.  It should've been served with a sauce and some kind of garnish. Ordered the ricotta gnocchi which was supposed to be very good but there was barely any sausage noticeable in the purée and tasted like Ragu spaghetti sauce.  We decided to skip dessert there and walked over to Morgensteins for ice cream to end the evening on a sweet note.  I was so excited to try Lupa because their Instagram looks great but I would not recommend it.
5769,"I used to be a big fan of Lupa but likely won't return after my latest experience here. We had a reservation for 8 pm. We checked in and the manager asked us to wait outside, and that she would come get us when a table was ready.When we stepped out, there was a congregation of diners-to-be waiting outside. Apparently they had all made reservations too, but were waiting 20+ minutes past their reservation time to be seated. We left when it was 8:20 pm with no table for us in sight. If you can't handle the timing on reservations, I have little faith you can handle the timing on your pasta. Forget al dente, I bet they are serving mediocre mushy pasta at this point."
5770,"Cool location ( they have more than one) made reservations at the wrong location and they were nice to make space for us . Great food, good service and nice Ambience. Clean and love that the have Sanitation wipes and pumps at the tables. They do not have dessert, so they put a candle in a shot drink ... very cool!! Think outside the boxMake a reservation Great food Cool drinks Good service Food price is Reasonable ( affordable)Restroom clean Definitely a great place to check out on the city"
5771,"This place is an absolute gem. They moved to 33rd St a few years back and changed the theme. They play jazz (as the name implies) all the time and the decor is very cool. It's not only a great place for Korean food but also serves delicious cocktails. If you're going there on a weekend, I recommend to book a table in advance. Otherwise, expect to wait for 30-45 minutes. They also have heated outdoor sitting. Last time we visited we had wings, fries and twister. Pro tip: their appetizers come in large portions."
5772,"Was looking for chicken wings and stumbled upon this place. I was extremely satisfied with the chicken. The Jazz refers to the background Jazz music that continues to play. Interior is fairly dim and relaxed. This rating heavily draws on the wings.Service was whatever. Only had three interactions to order, receive our food, and pay the bill. We never got our water refilled. That did drop my perspective a tad bit.Corn cheese wasn't the best, I've had better. Wouldn't order again. Besides that, we both opted for the fried chicken combo (wings and drumsticks). The soy garlic was tasty and I appreciated that the chicken was not drenched in sauce. It was more of a light coating almost comparable to a dry rub. The other flavor, spicy, was similar with mild heat so nothing special. I think the soy garlic was the better choice.Continuing with the chicken, it had the lightest yet crispiest coat. It was like air, crunchy yet thin. I think the way the chicken was fried was the highlight of the meal. The meat itself was rather standard, but the air fried crispiness elevates the chicken."
5773,"Ambience:Customer service was great and the ambience of the restaurant was soothing and calmFood reviews: Cheese sticks: very light and nicely fried but could do without compared to other dishes Edamame: amazing, must try!Fried dumplings: really good, would recommend the half and half Chicken wings: DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT TRYING! we love the half and half"
5774,"Interesting vibe here. Sort of an old school vibe with a light touch of jazz. Place was pretty packed on a Friday night. Had to wait for about 15-30 mins for a seat.We were seated off to the side in sort of an alcove room. Ordered and shared the half and half chicken wings and I ordered a grapefruit beer. The order took about 30 mins to come out. It seems like the wings are made fesh to order. The wings were fresh, crispy, and tasty.A nice place to go to for chicken wings, but make sure you have some time, due to the wait to enter and the time it takes to cook the food."
5775,"Turntable Chicken Jazz is just a phenomenal name for a restaurant.It certainly helps that the food matches the quality of the name!I came for dinner on a Friday night. It was popping! And loud. But man, oh man is the vibe fun! Next time I hope we can get a circular table instead of a rectangle for 6 people, but even still, it was a good time.I ordered a lychee juice which was delightful!We ordered a number of items for the table. First was the calamari, which was fried nicely. Very flavorful. We also got the seafood pancake which was awesome, but I am not an adventurous seafood eater, so was happy to let others devour that. Next time I want to try the kimchi pancake!We also got the cheesy corn and a huge order of wings with both the soy garlic and spicy sauces. The chicken was the real highlight here. We were in wing heaven!"
5776,"Fun spot for chicken and other Korean sides with really interesting, kind of vintage vinyl/music decor.Me and my friends came by to start our night here. The food and drinks were really good! The service was quick and attentive. The waiters made sure to quickly clean up extra plates and check in if we need anything. We shared wings and a bunch of apps (hush puppies, cheese corn, potato twister, pork belly salad) and everything was great. The food was hot and fresh without being too greasy. I also really liked the drinks (Melon pearl, pickle back shot).My only comment is that you can only make reservations for a party of 6+. If you're a smaller party, it might be hard getting a table around dinner time - either there's no space or you might be asked to leave to make room for the reservations. Not really a place you can linger at for drinks/apps."
5777,"SUCH a good spot. Not too busy on a Wednesday night, food was all delicious. Don't sleep on the bulgogi burger or the hush puppies. Fries are fabulous and of course the fried chicken was great!"
5778,"What a lovely surprise to find a Korean fried chicken place on the 5th floor! I came for happy hour (which is a great deal, especially for a Saturday evening!). The atmosphere is a pub vibe, with loud music and talking but its perfect for catching up with friends.The Korean fried chicken was super crispy and the hot and spicy definitely delivered on the hot and the spicy. The twister was also an experience - like freshly fried potato chips on a stick. The dumplings are so good here. The filling was japchae noodles and they're coated in the same sauce as the chicken wings - highly recommend. The soju for happy hour will definitely be bringing me back in! I believe I've found a new favorite restaurant in ktown!"
5779,"I came here on a Wednesday night and there was plenty of seating available. The atmosphere was romantic. Dimmed lights with a faux second floor lined with bookshelves filled with books and vintage radios and vinyls music players. Great for a date or a casual outting. Ordered the corn cheese, small combo of Korean fried chicken and the seafood pancake. The corn cheese was disappointing due to the lack of corn freshness, it tasted like canned sweet corn otherwise there was an appropriate amount of cheese to corn ratio. The Korean fried chicken was on decent, on the saltier end and lacked the crispness and flavor of other chicken I've had. The seafood pancake was good but not great. There was a generous amount lf seafood enough crust was on the thicker end. Overall food was okay. The atmosphere really bumped it to a three star rating for me."
5780,Ordered for pick up. You need to use their website.. do not callAnyway ordered 20 wings half spicy and half soy garlic. I was disappointed. When I tried it the chicken wasn't as crispy. Most were soggy. Also comes with the smallest little container of pickled radish and the pickled radish had some interesting spice and flavor to it.I deeply regretted not ordered from bonchon
5781,"I love turntable. I love coming for early for lunch. Sitting at the bar amazing Lychee Martini. I love the boneless wings. I get half garlic soy and half spicy.  The spicy is SPICY!!!!! But I love it. The pickled something they serve it with to helps with spicy. I also order the corn. Honestly everything I've ordered here has been delicious. Decor is nice and staff is always super attentive. I went to the other location once really late at night for the karaoke and it was a very interesting experience, I'll leave that for you to judge."
5782,"Man.. I was so disappointed with the chicken wings here! That was the only reason why I ate here for dinner.. I thought their Korean fried chicken would be bomb. Boy did I sign up for a disaster. I came here with 3 other people Tuesday night and we were quickly seated in the back since it wasn't too packed (but still had a lot of people). I ordered a grapefruit beer drink? Which tasted like grapefruit soda (it was good but just wasn't really what I expected). We also ordered kimchi fried rice, fries, and seafood pancake for the table. Everything just tasted okay to me...nothing exceptional and some dishes were a little mediocre. I think the major disappointment and low star rating is because of the fried chicken. It just wasn't flavorful and what I expected was the wing to be doused in a ton of sauce/seasoning as Korean fried chicken should be. Everything was just a bit below expectations (maybe because I'm from LA and we have koreatown there) and sadly, I probably wouldn't come back here."
5783,"I haven't seen my all time favorite couple since the beginning of the month. I usually see them once or twice (at minimum) a week, but due to traveling, work, and getting COVID in Texas, I did not get a chance to see them until yesterday. As a ""congrats getting out of quarantine"" celebration, my friend treated me to dinner. We got the following:Hush puppies: Just okay. You get some chew from the cornmeal, but it wasn't anything special. Would pass on these next time *Twisted potato: one of those spiral cut potatoes topped with ketchup I believe. Not bad. Nothing special, but a great French fry alternative *Bulgogi: Pretty good. The bowl the rice came in was bigger than the plate the bulgogi was in. For the price point, not much food. Cost purposes, would pass **Chicken wings: we got the spicy. It was pretty good. No complaints, nothing to rave about ***The drinks here are pretty good and you can customize them. The staff is nice, but based on the stuff I had, the food overall just okay. If you are in the area and looking for some jazz bar-like, but not jazz bar vibe, I would go here. I would skip on the food honestly and just go for the drinks! Their lavender dream? Was super pretty and delicious."
5784,"Super cheap chicken ($1/wing during happy hour) that's pretty tasty and great vibes. We also got a couple twisters; eat these as soon as they arrive! My only qualm was that the wings were a little burnt, and our first server was new on the job so she couldn't take our order properly.But I'm more than willing to overlook that when the music and ambiance is so good!"
5785,It was not too cold during my visit so we decided to sit outside. The outdoor seating was pretty nice. The area was separated into semi closed small sections. There was a heater too which it did get cold later on. The spicy dumplings and wings were my favorite. The soy & garlic flavor was too salty. Soju was a plus for the meal.
5786,"Amazing ambiance and really cool spot to get a meal. Be warned: these chicken wings will ruin all other chicken wings for you. The best I've ever had.Twister - the sauces on this were amazing. Really liked this to start. It's a spiral, deep fried potato. You won't regret it. Corn - this was ok, but deff not the star of the show. Save room for the wings.Kimchee fried rice - really great, large serving and the flavors were fantastic.Fried chicken wings - This is why I came here! Highly recommended by multiple friends, so I had to check it out. Lives up to the hype! I got half hot and half soy&garlic. The hot will have a nice heat. If you're sensitive to spice, you'll hate it. They double fry them so the skin is crispy, yet airy. How? The crunch is great and the sauces are delicious. I liked the soy and garlic slightly edged out the hot ones for me. Pisco pineapple - they have a nice cocktail list and this was a nice, balanced cocktail to have with dinner. So good, I got a second round.Overall this was a super memorable meal and I'll make this a stop every-time I'm in NYC."
5787,Good fried chicken that's crispy and juicy.Devoured entire mid combo and left without that yucky feeling when we visit chain Fried chicken joints.My body thank you for using quality ingredients.Listening to jazz and nice a ambiance was also very enjoyable.  Had to come at off hours so I can get my stamp here as last night lines were long and wait times was hour plus.Even eating at 3p there was only 1table avail... proof that this is a happening joint.
5788,Friday night craving for chicken wings fixed at this Korean jazz place.The ambiance is very welcoming and cozy. Christmas songs were playing at the background which made us the warm holiday moods. Korean rice cakes were about right; sweet yet a tad spicy flavor. We ordered some drinks to cool down. Perfecto!!!
5789,"Super cool spot, I can't believe it took me this long to discover it (but I also think they were closed for quite some time during COVID)! The interior is decorated from floor to ceiling with records, record players, and everything jazz galore. They play great music and it's an overall great atmosphere inside the restaurant. We got the corn cheese appetizer, twister potatoes, and of course the Korean fried chicken. The corn was a little heavy on the mayonnaise to my liking but still quite delicious. The potatoes are a rare find and are quite tasty but I will ask for the sauces on the side next time since it tends to make things messy when eating. The star of our meal was definitely the chicken. We got half soy and half sweet and spicy combo. The chicken had a perfectly light and crisp exterior packed with flavor and had a juicy and soft interior. Don't skip the chicken when you come here or you'll regret it. Definitely some of the best Korean fried chicken in the city."
5790,"love the ambiance of this place. really cool vibe. service was super quickly, with our first app coming out before our drinks even. mozz sticks - light and fluffy with great cheese pull. came out a little cold but super yummykimchi pancake- a bit milder than your typical kimchi pancake, probably good for someone who doesn't do korean that much. no spice to it, we actually asked for gochujang on the side which they said they didn't have. () but they did have sriracha wings- we got half and half. much preferred the ""hot spicy one"" (not that spicy at all) over the soy. great crisp. smaller than expected, I also didn't expect them to be de-assembled if that makes sense? kinda thought we'd get the whole wing in tact. drinks- really solid. got the lavender fairy which was SUPER lavender. I actually couldn't finish it but it was one of those drinks that's super refreshing and satisfying"
5791,"OMG - this place! Loved the decor, the food, the drinks! We happened to stumble upon it on a Saturday night nearby to K-Town. It was amazing that we were able to get a table without  a reservation, but I think the stars were aligned in our favor. Out of sheer indecision, we decided to go 'family style' with our orders. Pro tip: family style = more food for me! So yeah, we did end up ordering like half the menu, but with options so mouthwatering, it was inevitable. Of course we went with bulgogi, Korean chicken wings, a whole bunch of other things and, finally, HUSH PUPPIES! So, food - check. Order it all. Decor - SO fun! There are records (LPs) stacked floor to ceiling, cute little displays here and there, and everything is a rustic wood setting. Makes the whole ambiance really approachable and hangout-able-in. And being in Midtown Manhattan, it's easily accessible. It's awesome to hit up after a show or something or even just any night of the week to chill w/friends."
5792,"Don't sleep on this incredible gem in herald square! We came on a busy Friday night and were seated indoors very quickly. The ambiance? Phenomenal. The vibes? Immaculate. The food? Delicious. The drinks? Strong. The service? Impeccable. I ordered the veggie fried rice and it was hot, fresh and flavorful. For drinks, I had the sangria (a little too sweet for me) and the basil martini.Definitely recommend it here!! 10/10"
5793,"I definitely really like the vibe of this place, but I wish it was more ""Jazz-y"" as it says! It's not your typical kind of Korean spot, but this definitely seems more Americanized Korean fusion based on the taste of all the food items here.I tried the Korean fried chicken of course and I was really surprised how crunchy they made the skin to be! Something I never really had before with that type of crunch, but it was definitely a really nice to have. The flavors aren't that particularly strong as well, but just basically really like fried chicken. I remembered the spicy was actually pretty spicy for me too, considering I have low tolerance of spice lol. We also got the corn cheese and that was pleasantly nice and cheesy-- can't go wrong with corn cheese! Also a Kimchi pancake, they did a really good job with infusing the kimchi as well."
5794,"We come just for the Korean wings. Don't get the drumsticks or combo. Get the wings (flat and drumettes). The bigger drumstick is too much meat to coating and sauce ratio so it tastes more bland. It's spicy, sweet, oh so crispy. You must wait 20 minutes as it's cooked to order. But it is worth it. What is not worth it is takeout or delivery. For some reason it doesn't carry well. I tried it once and never again. Just go sit down, get a drink, and wait the 20 minutes for the wings. The interior is pretty cool and definitely gives a jazzy bar vibe. Drinks are good. Priced as every other bar/restaurant in ktown."
5795,"Decided to check this place out based on friend's recommendation. My Korean Fried Chicken standard is relatively high as I have tried many different KFC places in Korea as well as here in the state. That being said, I would say this place is still up to par when it comes to the taste. First of all, I highly recommend trying their chicken as well as their kimchi fried rice. The corn cheese and the twisted potatoes were good, but their chicken and fried rice were better. I also recommend soy sauce over spicy, unless you like to try the spicy sauce. The chicken batter is so crispy, which was my favorite part about their chicken. The total came out to be ~ $80s including tip (large chicken combo, fried rice, potatoes, corn cheese, two soju bombs), which was not bad at all. Come check this place out if you crave good KFC with some beer/soju!"
5796,The environment indoors is so calming and nice. I love the lighting and music. The food was amazing and outstanding! I can eat their chicken for hours. The crunch and juiciness was unbelievable. I will 100% be coming back for more chicken from here. Best fried chicken I've had in Koreatown/34 street!
5797,"A chill spot to grab dinner! Came on a Thursday night to grab dinner with a friend. The place was wasn't too busy and they were playing some chill jazz music. We ordered 12 Wings with half soy and half spicy, which was pretty good. The skin was nice and crispy but I wish there was a bit more sauce on the wings. I personally liked the spicy better. The Seafood Pancake was pretty good, the squid flavor was really great. The Bulgogi Platter is on par with most bulgogi I've had before. The most notable thing was how small the portion is though. Overall good food and great ambience. The service was really great too."
5798,"Turntable is my favorite KFC-joint! I would go here often before the pandemic and was really missing those twisters and soy garlic wings... We ordered for takeout on Ubereats and it tasted just the same!The packaging was great and they listened to our instructions for extra crispy soy garlic/hot wings.I also enjoyed how the twisters came with sauce on the side so they wouldn't get soggy on our way back. The dumplings (soy garlic/hot) were also good, but got a little soggy I guess due to condensation.Can't wait to order from here again until we can dine in/out!!"
5799,"First time here, wow super hidden spot. The lighting is dim inside, wouldn't have noticed it without my friend asking me to go here. The fried dumplings were delicious, we got half spicy and had soy; the spicy was semi strong. I got the soy wings, omg so delicious. The wings were super crispy and the soy was so good. I definitely recommend this spot and would go back to try other things on the menu. I tried the passion fruit lemonade which sounded good but didn't expect it to be sparkling (which I am not a fan of)."
5800,"Wayyyyyy better than BonChon, waaaayyyyyy better than Pelicana. This has been our go to spot for amazing, crispy, flavorful, candied crunch Korean Fried Chicken.We always order the wings half spicy, half soy sauce flavor. Switching between the two flavors is the only way to do it. We've been here a bunch of times and all of their other food has been really good. The portions are generous, the quality excellent. Love the space here, surrounded by thousands of records, jazz photos and music. Unique concept for a KFC spot. Their cocktails are also strong and delicious. ;) Love you, never go away!"
5801,"Came here on a Saturday night and didn't realize that they had 3 locations in Ktown. Decor is super unique with vintage vinyl records all throughout the restaurant. The vibe is super chill and there was a live DJ playing house music mixed with a little bit of jazz and old school jams. My friends and I already ate before coming here so we ordered 2 pitchers of beer to relax and to enjoy the music. Also the waiter was super nice because my boyfriend had left his book bag with his wallet inside and when we came back, the bag was safely hidden away in the front with a tag."
5802,"Went here on a Monday night with a group of about 10 people! They take reservations for groups of 8+, so it was convenient for our rather big group. However, wasn't the biggest fan of this place- maybe my Korean fried chicken standards are too high after having it often in the motherland, but it was okay. The chicken itself was juicy and meaty, but the flavoring of it was rather bland. I couldn't really tell the difference between soy garlic and spicy, both tasted pretty similar. Overall, I felt like the place was overpriced for what is is. Alcohol was expensive too- $19 for a small soju from what I remember...The interior of this place is decorated well and very cute. They play jazz in the background and it is a cute little place. Their beer towers are a crowd pleaser with all the dry ice spewing from the top. Maybe their other foods are good, but wasn't too impressed overall."
5803,I usually come here after a long day of work to unwind. My go-to menu items are the fried chicken and the grilled edamame. Love how this place has an option to grill their edamame instead of steaming. The potato twist is also so savory and delicious as well.  The bar tender is great at making drinks and got my dirty martini extra dirty! The olives stuffed with blue cheese is super delicious and flavorful as well. It is the perfect amount of acidity to accompany my other food with.
5804,Got KFC?My favorite place in NY to get Korean Fried Chicken is Olive but I'm open to trying new places. Menu lots to choose from. Quick serviceWhat we order?Seafood pancake -crispSoy Garlic Chicken Spicy Chicken -heat level Spicccccey!Cheese corn- ehhh Fries- crispy Kimchi chicken riceand 2 orders of the Lychee soju- get you turnt lol
5805,"Amongst the many restaurants in K town, this restaurant has probably the best vibes in the whole block. The interior decor is lined with old fashioned albums and vinyl records. At the back of the restaurant, there's a ""dj booth"" where I believe is where they play their music selection! Essentially, this place is a fusion of a modern jazz club that serves korean fried chicken! Unfortunately it can be loud and you do have to yell to hear conversations when it's busy, but it's all vibes!We ordered the large size of half spicy and normal korean fried chicken. I split these with two other friends and it's a bargain for ~$27! The crunchiness and flakiness of the skin is some of the best in NYC. The kfc (korean fried chicken) is super juicy and some of the best high quality. It does take approximately 30 minutes for the dish to be prepared, but that's how you know it's legit! As far as taste, the spicy wasn't spicy and I didn't think it was too spectacular. The normal was great, nice sweet and savory sauce with a little tang at the end! It doesn't really remind of the KFC sauce you taste in Korea, but their interpretation of it is amazing! Pelicana gets the sauce right, but they're a chain in Korea so not surprised there. Overall, the vibes, good food and cost is a great place to hang in K town. But warning, it does get packed very quick during prime hours and weekend."
5806,"This feels textbook four stars. There was nothing wrong with it, and the service was quite attentive and friendly. The food was also pretty good, and I think I would come back if I was craving a bunch of fried stuff; however, in this day and age of eating healthy, I don't think there is anything on the menu for vegans or people trying to be health-conscious.Good thing I'm neither!We ordered the fried chicken, which a few at our table refused to get unless it was boneless. The boneless wings were tasty, although I think I have a slight preference for the ones at BonChon.We also got the corn, which was very good. And we ordered the spiral potato. Pro tip: get two of them, because people will fight over one if you only order one.The other dishes were not all that noteworthy. The fried rice was so-so, and the rice cake that we ordered was nothing to write home about. What I really loved about the place was the decor and the interior design. It felt like you were transported back in time to...a speakeasy? Or a turntable? Or a jazz bar? I can't quite put my finger on it, but it was really cool."
5807,The best part of Turntable Chicken Jazz has to be the decor and the vibe of the restaurant. The lighting is dim and the walls are filled with unique decor such as old vinyls and music players. The restaurant is pretty loud but it fits the vibe of being an old jazz club and it's a great hangout spot with friends. I came here for lunch right when the restaurant was open so there wasn't a wait to be seated. I came in a group of 3 and we ordered the large Korean fried chicken combo (half soy and half spicy) and the spicy rice cake. It was enough for 3 people and we were all pretty full. The Korean fried chicken took some time to come out and I would recommend ordering other dishes as well so you can eat while waiting for the chicken. I liked the portion sizes they give and how the drum sticks were really large. I do think more sauce can be added to the fried chicken and the flavors could be stronger. I loved the spicy rice cake and I added cheese to the dish.
5808,"I came here upon a friends recommendation. I arrived about 15 minutes after opening and was surprised to find the establishment empty! The waiter was super courteous and attentive (thanks Kihoon!)I ordered the small spicy boneless breast fried chicken, and I loved it! It was a little difficult to cut with the knife but if I had eaten it like finger food it would've been perfect! There wasn't TOO much breading which was a plus and it was just the right amount of crispy/crunchy. I was expecting it to be a little more spicy, but nonetheless it was a great dish. I have explored too many restaurants in Koreatown but this one has a great vibe for group meals! Would come back again!!"
5809,"I have a huge weakness for Korean fried chicken and this place perfectly satisfies it. Stopped by for a weekday lunch and there was no wait. I've had KFC before (Bonchon, Kyochon - now closed), but severely underestimated the sizes of these wings while ordering a 20 piece platter. Soy garlic flavor is always my go to flavor and it didn't disappoint. The only downside was that the wait time was at least 25+ mins...for a place that specializes in chicken...crazy. Hell our potato twister came out 20 mins before the main meal. The atmosphere inside is cool, dark and trendy. The hostesses/servers are slow and would much rather prefer chatting amongst themselves. Come for the chicken, nothing else."
5810,"This place absolutely lives up to the hype!! I went with two friends, we ordered pull apart garlic & Parmesan bread, Mac n cheese, and a French dip sandwich. Everything was delicious and the service was on point. Heads up, the portions are massive. Seriously, MASSIVE. Come very hungry and be prepared to leave with leftovers. Considering the great quality and portion sizes, price point is incredibly reasonable. I unfortunately don't live here or this would be a regular spot for me!"
5811,"I want to use expletives because this restaurant just kicks brunch into high gear. The service, the wait, the food?! Everything clicks nicely at Maison Pickle.Their brunch menu is so eclectic yet common at the same time. I don't know if that makes sense...I guess you could say that their offerings are ""classic"" fare, but delivered in unexpected ways.For example, their patty melt and fries are just that...but it is presented/tastes like something otherworldly. Their fried chicken and toast are beyond reproach: huge/well-seasoned chicken cutlets, huge/toasted slices of sweet and buttery toast, drowned in syrup and bacon bits. They even have options like hash browns and apple sauce, just the kind of offbeat food combos I live for.I didn't even talk about the price. This joint is easy on the pocket despite the quality of service and food offerings. Highly recommend."
5812,"I want to start by saying that I love Jacob Pickles and was super excited to try Maison out, but unfortunately it was a let down. When we arrived we were seated with the brunch menu and were told they were trying to limit the amount of time to an hour which is understandable, but it took about 25 minutes before someone even came to take our drink order. By the time they came to take our food order it was already dinner time and we had to change our order. To start we had the bone marrow, shrimp pillow dumpling, honey and butter pull apart bread and the deviled eggs. The shrimp pillow dumpling looked delicious and came in a smooth velvet sauce, but it lacked flavor. The pull apart bread was delicious though. The bone marrow and devil eggs were okay. For the entrée we ordered the buffalo mac and cheese, a patty melt and the ribeye. The ribeye was overcooked. I ordered the steak medium and came out medium well. The fries were cold too. The patty melt is suppose to be cooked medium and it was cooked medium rare. The middle was still leaking blood. The mac and cheese was creamy and flavorful, so it became the star of the entrees. For dessert and the main reason for the visit we had the confetti 24 layer cake and it was good, but not something amazing that would make me want to go back. We stayed over 2 hours because the service was super slow and honesty 3 different people served us so we did not even know who our waiter was. We ended up ordering Jacob Pickles to go!"
5813,"Very glad to see they're still open but somehow I didn't manage to get a slice of the chocolate cake. Why? - because I inhaled the fried chicken & toast. I had no idea how massive it was until it arrived just as a trio of men walked by and they HECKLED me about it. Guess size does matter when it comes to brunch! They were very COVID safe with checking of temperature on the wrist, QR code for the contact tracing form, QR code menu, and nicely spaced out sidewalk seating."
5814,"I have been to Maison Pickle several times and had good experiences. However, the two times we ordered take out, they completely messed up our orders. Last night's experience was inexcusable, though. Not only did they forget the au jus and gruyère cheese sauce with the Deluxe French Dip, but the meat was completely raw in parts (as you can see in the photos below).  I would absolutely not recommend ordering from this restaurant for take out."
5815,"One of the best brunch spots I've been to! As soon as I saw picture of the fried chicken and french toast, I knew I needed to try it. We tried the hot honey chicken and toast and oh my, I don't even know where to begin. As much as I love fried chicken, sometimes the chicken ends up being dry or there's way too much breading. There was just the right amount of breading, which was also very flavorful. The chicken was juicy. The french toast was beautifully caramelized, and topped off with hot honey with just the right amount of kick to it. We also tried the fries with gruyere fondue. The thin fries were a great match for the gruyere fondue. Just a warning, portions are huge! I can't wait to come back again to try more items on the menu."
5816,"This was my first time getting brunch at Maison Pickle and it didn't disappoint. The hot honey French toast was super flavorful and filling. Would definitely come back! Make sure you go with a big appetite, portions are very generous."
5817,"Everything was wonderful! The establishment, service, food! Definitely recommend! Make a reservation. We made a reservation, and we were seated right away. The servings are huge, so if you can't handle huge servings I recommend sharing."
5818,"Had brunch here with my friends and loved every second of it. The portions are huge! I had half the toast saved for leftovers the next day. AND THAT PULL APART BREAD...I would return every week just to have that bread again. Soft, buttery and full of flavor, it's toooo good. Can't wait to try the rest of the bread options on my next visit!"
5819,"I made a reservation  here yesterday to celebrate my boyfriends birthday along with our four month old daughter. It was for 2:30pm. The informed the hostess that we had an infant with us she asked if I had a stroller and I said I do. She explained that she would seat us where we could just park the stroller, but that turned out to be an issue because we were seated directly next to a service area in which they brought back dirty dishes and took  payment. That kind of annoyed me but I didn't let that ruin the fun.  I was not seated until a little after 3pm. She did ask for vaccination card along with any form of ID. Our server was great sadly I can't remember his name but he did have a rainbow mask I remember. We ordered the garlic Parm bread that didn't stand a chance so damn good! My boyfriend had the fried chicken Ceasar salad and myself the fried chicken and French toast. It was really good but also too much food that we ended up taking it home and had it for breakfast this morning. Drinks I had a mimosa and he had two Moscow mules and a shot. Overall reasonably priced I feel bill was was $156 with gratuity included. Curious for what they offer for dinner will visit again, but not with our daughter. One suggestion I don't think it makes sense that they have seating on the opposite side of the bar it's too much traffic but they were pretty quick with seating for other guest. For that reason I'll  have to say 4 stars I would visit again.  Sorry I didn't take any pics of the food it was great though!"
5820,Would recommend if you are looking for a quick and easy meal and you are craving fish. I had the salmon and spicy ahi tuna and surprisingly the quantity and quality of the fish was very good. The spicy tuna does have a kick so if you enjoy spicy food I would highly recommend. I think the salmon was a much better cut and the fattiness made the bowl that much better. Next time I'll go for the spicy salmon or just the salmon and leave the tuna out. Check it out if you are running to a meeting or working late.
5821,"Went on Tuesday to grab lunch with my boyfriend. The place itself looked nice and I liked the choices they have. Small place, the bowls we got were good but the guy who was helping us was extremely rude, we were just getting signature bowls with different bases, he asked me many times the same question but I was patient. I wanted to get the sauce on the side and for some reason that guy got upset about it. And he got even angrier when I asked for side of extra sauce. In a rude way he told me that it only comes with 1 sauce and I was okay with purchasing it but the way he communicated was so rude and said it's ok I don't need it thanks, he flipped out completely was mumbling something while leaving to the back. Thank god girl at the checkout helped us out. Bowls were good but I will definitely skip this place next time because of that customer experience."
5822,"Today was the third time I saw a worker add a tip to the order themselves! After the transaction goes through and you have to choose the tip on the screen if you want to tip or press the ""no tip"" option before you walk out of this establishment, make sure you do it yourself! I know a lot of people (including myself) sometimes just swipe the card and go if they are in a rush, but please don't do it, at least not at this particular location ( I haven't ordered from other locations so I don't know anything about it). As a service industry worker I know how important it is to get tips, but isn't it supposed to be optional? How do you just take someone else's money without their consent even if it's just a few dollars?! Sometimes even just a few dollars could make a big difference for someone. What a weird experience!"
5823,"I love poke and even though I had a feeling that this ain't it, I still had to try and unfortunately I was right. The food wasn't bad or anything but it also wasn't amazing. I'm just too spoiled by Hawaii poke I think. A lot of selections including cauliflower riceThe poke were pricey but the staff were awesome."
5824,Pokeworks was ok but not great. I ordered the spicy ahi tuna with cauliflower rice. The service was fast and they were very nice. The food was ok in that it was fresh but lacked a lot of taste. The serving size of actual poke was pretty small as well given how much it costs. Probably would not come back or I would try something else.
5825,"Pokeworks is my favorite ""fast food"". Reasonably priced and best selections and quantity of ingredients out of any poke place I've been too including other not nearly as-good chains!"
5826,"Freshly prepared with high quality ingredients, Pokeworks is go-to if I want a healthy but delicious meal. I usually make my own bowl. There are lots of ingredients to choose from. Plus if you order in store, Pokeworks tells you how my calories for each ingredient which is helpful for people on diet. The staff are very attentive and courteous. Both the food and service deserve a 5 star."
5827,So so good! A true whole in the wall - perfect little knack of a spot. Quality is 10/10. Huge variety of add-ons. Great customer service. Also clean!
5828,"Jayden was an absolute sweetheart, and definitely compensated for a not so good experience I had before. Will definitely be coming back for his amazing service and good chat."
5829,"For such an absurdly priced meal, the poke bowl was one of the worst I've had. Definitely not worth the price and it made me feel a little sick."
5830,Ana gave great costumer service and patience when I was being indecisive about what I wanted.
5831,"I walked in for an online order, it wasn't ready but the cashier instantly helped me while her coworkers helped everyone already there in line. Food was yummy. Will be back"
5832,"Pokeworks have gone a bit downhill from where they were years ago. Gone are some of their unique offerings. I came here one evening and they were out of avocado. The bowl they made me was too salty and they were stingy with their toppings. Not a fan of their wonton chips which has black pepper on them, making it too strong and overpowering. Some locations are better than others."
5833,Happy I found this places. Love poke bowls. Ingredients are fresh and staff is nice
5834,"So my 2nd order after the pandemic and sadly it's getting worst each time... 1st time, I realize many pre-pandemic ingredients are gone(albacore tuna, different seaweed, mango etc.) I said OK used to like the place so will deal with it. The taste wasn't bad but the white rice was cold and hard as if i am the last person.2nd time, today, the rice is still cold, but not as hard as it was before, masago now cost money, edamame is gone... Ingredients is obviously not so fresh. Taste is still acceptable, but portion is getting even smaller on a 3 protein. Like 3/5 full. No wonder the place doesn't have a line like it used to back pre-pandemic...Yea at this rate I'd rather walk alittle further away to poke bar. For basically the same price I get better selections."
5835,Food is alright when it is actually available or you can get it on time. They really need to step up their game and figure out what works and what doesn't.First time I tried there food  it was good but they didn't have many orders so they actually were able to do it.When they are busy they just don't seem like they are aware of what is happening1/ I went to get a mealpal i waited 45 minutes LOL which is wild there was 3 other people also waiting for mealpals + a bunch of people who preordered online... so what is the point of preordering if you guys can't handle online orders or mealpals don't offer it..2/ Today was a little bit of a breaking point for me.. I hateee being rude. I wanted to get the spam musubi they offer and it is good and tasty. I order it and ritual works says order accepted then order being made and then order ready for pick up. I started walking out like 5-10 minutes after order is ready for pick up..When they call me and say they don't have it I was pretty mind blown the order didn't just come up they arent busy at this time so why wait so long. ... the girl speaking to me was talking to me and I am guessing the manager at the same time and it was frustrating. I feel they should have reached out earlier and been like we don't have your food then I asked her to just cancel and process a refund please and she says we can't do that you need to reach out to ritual works WHICH i have never heard before but okay.Maybe the other locations are better but this one they need to STEP UP THEIR GAME.
5836,"Horrible service, understaffed, always out of ingredients and consistently incorrect orders. I have been double charged on several occasions and trying to deal with customer service for a refund is a nightmare. Avoid this place."
5837,"It was very nice that the pokeworks guest services responded immediately to my review and sent me a voucher for any entree. It's nice to see customer service that cares. While I greatly appreciate my semi-full salad, I had to ask for extra everything. I noticed that people seem to get more food/toppings when they are in the store and in the employee's faces. It seems I always get less when I place a pick-up order. This is how it was in the past and it is why I usually go in person to order but I have gotten lazy after the pandemic and it isn't right that you have to be staring at them to get the decent serving you paid for. I guess I have to stop being lazy.... And they should stop charging extra for avocados when they look the way they look and try to give them away for free. When you're offered the avocados (even bad looking ones), one might appreciate the gesture. When you tell them you need to charge them extra for nasty avocados, one might be offended. That's just my two cents. With that said, my salad was DELICIOUS."
5838,"This place used to be really good pre-pandemic. I don't know what happened. I came back recently in two occasions, one for dinner and one for a MealPal and this was disappointing to say the least. Management has to step up but they don't seem to be training their employees well or prepping the ingredients well. It's definitely not the same quality as I remembered.The MealPal is definitely a no go.I came in and told them I was picking up a MealPal. Had to go through two people to instruct me, whom are nonchalant, where the MealPal was which was sitting on a shelf by the door. When I opened up my MealPal, there's barely any sauce or ingredients (granted this is a MealPal but still skimpy). And packed the bowl with a lot of rice and it was very soggy.For the regular bowl, again rice wasn't good and not the same. Threw out half the bowl. They also got rid of the sauce station which I guess it's for COVID purpose. Management needs to work on improvement."
5839,"Ordered 2/11/22. There was an item missing from my order and absolutely no one I could contact. Their phone goes straight to voicemail, and they never responded to the voicemail I left. I emailed promise@pokeworks.com and they responded the next day. They gave me a partial refund despite me asking for a full refund because I made my order to get that item. Incredibly disappointed. I was excited for the Omni musubi."
5840,Okay Pokeworks. You grew on me. I got used to adding as much toppings as I want and the ingredients are better quality from before. There are also toppings that no other poke spots have.Customer service is superb as well!
5841,"I have a poke addiction. And pokeworks does a good job feeding that addiction. This place gets pretty crowded at lunch so try to go during off peak hours if you don't want to wait in line.TIP: Check in with Yelp for a free bowl of miso soup. What's even cooler is that the miso soup comes out of a miso soup machine! Just press a button and the soup will come out. There is no limit to the number of toppings you can get, which makes me like Pokeworks so much. There are also so many options to keep even the pickiest eater happy. The quality is excellent too."
5842,"A tried-and-true poke spot that's slowly losing it's novelty with all the other up-and-coming poke restaurants. Had many of their bowls, but now really only getting them through MealPal since it's slightly cheaper. Quality of the MealPal is slightly lower since it's not made to order and the portions are also less. However, still a good option amongst the other MealPal spots. In terms of their regular menu, IMO the quality seems to have gone a bit down since I've initially tried it. I like how they blend the proteins with the sauce and mix-in the other toppings so that there's less mixing on your part. Not much to complain about other than the relatively high prices and small portions, but then again this is Manhattan. Overall, due to the long lines I've encountered, I've opted for online ordering through their app. Most of the time, they're not prepared at the designated time--understandable since many times the line is to the door. This is also one of the reasons I've switched to MealPal since the meals are typically ready and sitting there near the register. I would give this 3.5 stars if I could based on my experiences overall (0.5 down due to the reasons above, and since Yelp only allows whole #'s)."
5843,"I LOVE Pokeworks. The fish is fresh, there are many options, and the poke bowls are delicious.  I always ""build my own"" with ""three scoops"" of fresh salmon! There are several options for mix-ins, sauces, and crunch. Yum! I will keep coming back for more!"
5844,"You will never catch me saying the name right but you'll always find me wanting to eat there. I love Pokeworks. I found it on thrillist about a year ago. It was a Facebook page that showed all the newest places to eat in New York. Correction, Instagram worthy places they were showing. It's there where I saw the sushi burrito and I was like I must have it. I love sushi and I love burritos so there was no way I was passing up a chance to try the two in one. I slowly became obsessed but then finally stopped eating it all together. I switch to getting bowls a few times after I had burrito when I saw someone get it. Then I took a break from going there. After a long hiatus I came back and a lot had change with there menu as well as price. Mainly price, which is now why I get them once in a blue moon. To be honest it's not worth $13. I paid 10 and would get avocado to make it $11.50. Now it's just too costly for my budget. If you don't care about price then you should definitely stop by there. I go to the same one every time. Near herald square on 34th st in New York. It's right around the corner of Chick-Fila. Today my boss treated me to lunch because we had a crazy work day and I held our store together by myself. So when he said I'm treating to lunch I was like let's do Pokeworks. I did a custom bowl, 2 protein option. I always get salmon and scallop as my protein. I don't know why I don't try something else really. I think it's because I love salmon and I don't have scallops often. I got mixed greens, rice, salmon, scallops, jalapeño pepper, cucumbers, edamame, mango, kale, chive. As my sauce I wanted spicy mayo. I wanted light on the sauce but I realize in life you don't always get what you want. The young lady and man that was helping me was very pleasant.As far as the place goes, it's is clean and quite. It is small set up because honestly it's a grab and go kinda of restaurant. There is no seating area in this location. They have a bar style wall with four chairs. However, this isn't always ideal when you want to just sit and eat. So, be sure you have somewhere you can go to eat. If not you'll be stuck standing eating. Overall I really enjoy the food but it's no longer my go to when I'm hungry because for me the price is just to high. I am currently trying to eat out only on occasions and cook more at home. However, like I stated before if you don't mind the price go for it. It's definitely worth trying out."
5845,"Conveniently located near Bryant Park, it's my go to poke spot for when I want something to eat while people watching and attending events 0in Bryant Park. The interior is clean but smaller than the other poke stores/chains I've been to. There's about 6 bar stools in the front of the store. The staff are always welcoming and happy to introduce the concept of poke to people who has never had it before. The menu options are pretty much the standard ones you'd find in any poke store but I wish they had zucchini noodles and different sized portions (like a snack size) too. The regular portion they have also actually feels smaller than a similarly priced option at other chains. They have a good drink selection by the register with fruit based juices like passion fruit & orange and lychee. They do have a water dispenser by the utensils in the front so that's a plus. Overall a solid poke place with friendly faces and a good selection of toppings."
5846,Great service as always but they also have a new Serrano sauce that's great! Thanks for the sample! Can't wait to try the full new menu.
5847,"I haven't been to Pokeworks before so as we were waiting for the Anime store nearby to open, I ordered a poke bowl to go. The store has quite a number of toppings to choose. My favorite ones include: - Orange slices, mango, cucumber, edamame, seaweed salad, masago, garlic crisps, toasted rice puffs.- The Umami Shoyu sauce was pretty good. I want to try the Sirarcha Aioli next time.- The ahi tuna was good , along with the salmon. There were a few salmon pieces that were a little fatty to me, though.What I would not recommend:- Brown rice as a base. They totally messed this one up. The rice was hard as if it has been out and left over from the previous day. It was completely not edible.- The two seaweeds from the Mix-ins. They were dry seaweeds that were very tough to chew. My jaw hurts from processing these the whole time. Just leave them out.Overall, I enjoyed my poke. But that brown rice has got to go."
5848,For a quick to go meal that feels healthy this is the spot. I do however feel that my protein was lacking. I got a bowl with salmon and no other protein. Afterwards I found out that you were suppose to pick two proteins. I would have thought that they would have just doubled my protein. The wasabi aioli sauce was very tasty. There are only 5 seats at a counter so I would suggest taking it to go and sitting at the park.
5849,"Me and my sister walk miles and miles to find out best poke place in town is not the best ! Very dirty and legit like 2 seats to seat down ! All the silver wear was dirty and after I done eating my poke bowl in the end, I saw a Huge black HAIR I was discussed and almost threw up in my mouth ! Legit not worth it and don't trust the 4 stars believe me this place at least 2 stars ! Nasty !"
5850,"I've never been there.  But have ordered several times.  The poke bowls are delicious!  Better than any other I've had.The level of customization is great!  Choices of sweet, savory, spicy.  Each ingredient adds whatever you like in terms of both taste and texture.  You can get a pre-set combination or totally customize your bowl.  They offer ingredients I've never seen on other Poke menus.  And all very fresh and good quality ingredients."
5851,"Wow I can't believe how poorly this place is maintained. The table, the floor and the sauce station were all dirty. I had to wipe my table and saw the guy next to me did the same. It was 4pm when business is slow so they should have plenty of free time to clean-up right? What annoyed me more was their low food stock. They were out of salmon(a major thing for poke), mango and lotus chips(which drew me here). I asked why they were out of everything and the staff said because too many people ordered today. Hmmm nonsense. You close at 8pm and it's not even dinner time yet?! I saw some customers got upset about no salmon and left right away.My poke bowl was good. Well I've never had bad experience with poke. So no point to come again."
5852,"Pretty good! My first comment to get out of the way is that it is tiny and there is only a couple of bar stools to sit at on a counter, so when it's super cold out, you are taking it to go. A lot of NYC places are small and I accept that, but if this had some places to sit at, I'd be in love.I love the concept of a sushi burrito. It packs in a lot of flavors and is an easy hand held eat. The Chipotle-like ordering style is easy to follow. They also have a few pre-assembled favorites, but I liked the idea of ordering my toppings step by step. $10.95 for 2 proteins was a really good price since it's all seafood proteins which can sometimes get pricey. Throw on some veggies, sauces, and crunchies, and you are good to go. For my first time, I did play it safe with some cucumber and kale and some classic sauce, but I'd love to try some of the more unusual ingredients sometime.The girl making my burrito was helpful with suggestions and describing the sauces. The line moved very quickly. I think if you are inclined to go to a park to eat or take it back somewhere with you, then you are in for a real treat. There are enough ways to have combinations that I look forward to coming again if I need to get some takeout again."
5853,"I'm relatively confident that this Pokeworks was my first exposure to poke, back in June 2016. Then, the line stretched down the block. Today, arriving around 11:30 am to continue my week of sushi lunches, I faced little wait, and was in and out in 5 minutes.I created my own bowl, with ahi tuna and salmon in ponzu fresh sauce on a bed of brown rice with an embarrassment of toppings. Price was $12ish for a regular after tax and tip; not bad. It was more than enough for lunch.The salmon was tasty, but the tuna had something slightly off in its texture-- a few tough knots. Sauce was salty with a little citrus, but worked. All of the toppings were great, with the garlic and rice crisps adding a lot of texture, and the shiso, mandarin orange, and red seaweed were highlights. Topping were more generously portioned than fish, but not egregious. The rice was warm and had a soft texture, and managed to not cook my fish even though I was in transit for 10 minutes. Only other complaint was that the crab salad was super heavy on the mayo and had a bit of an off taste.This location is tiny; you can sit in one of the 6 seats if need be, but not exactly an ambiance to linger in. Service is a bit brusque; think they're used to a usual lunch rush.I don't know if I would be willing to wait around the block for it again, but it mostly held up to my old expectations. Recommended-- in the higher bracket of NYC poke with Chikarashi and Humble Fish."
5854,"3.5It makes sense why Pokeworks has almost 1.5k reviews and still has 4 stars. The ingredients are fresh and portions are very filling. I went on Labor Day and it was packed. The regular is $10.95 and large is $13.50 - which is one more scoop of protein/raw fish and one more scoop of rice. $2.50 for another scoop of raw fish essentially - you can judge if that's worth it for you but the regular is definitely a big enough portion, even for my boyfriend and especially when you try to stuff it with everything you can because why not. Here's my tip: don't add everything you can think of because when it all comes together, it can be overwhelming and not mix well together. And that's kind of what happened to me - if I didn't add edamame, my sushi burrito might have been even more delicious. It's really frustrating to get a sushi burrito, pick it up and it starts tearing and everything starts to fall out simply because the knife didn't cut the seaweed and brown paper wrapper all the way through. Then while balancing the half sushi burrito in one hand, trying to rip the uncut part away with another hand. It literally ruined the beginning of my sushi burrito experience here. If I'm ever in the area again, I may be back but with all the poke places popping up around NYC, it's not worth a trek. There's a park by Macy's with chairs and tables that you can eat at! Pokeworks only has about five high stool seats along the wall so don't count on eating inside."
5855,"Nope. This place is disappointing. The staff is BEYOND rude... very off putting. I kept telling them what I wanted in my bowl, and this girl kept putting inside whatever she wanted. I got annoyed with her, since I specifically asked twice not to put any ginger, and she kept dumping it inside the bowl. When I once again asked not to put any, she gave me the look. I mean, f#*k you. The others acted like they were doing me a favor serving me. Their poke bowls look nice (and are indeed sizable), but the ingredients are not fresh. I couldn't tell the difference between the ahi Tina and the salmon. The ponzu fresh sauce was so salty I almost couldn't eat it. The place itself is bare, and has basically no seating (just a couple of bar stools), so you can't even stay. Never again."
5856,Such a shame that they are only getting two stars from me because the food was really good. We traveled pretty far to come here too!The restaurant is super small so things are kind of unorganized and cramped with the ordering line. You start by telling them what size you want then they pass you down the line and each person behind the counter adds things to your dish. We decided on a burrito and just needed a second to see if we were gonna split one or each get our own the girl who was helping was SO unnecessarily rude toward us. She rushed the shit out of us and pushed us forward practically before we were even decided. The next kid was the same way. Just short spoken and rude and not exactly willing to explain things to us. Like I said the joint is so teeny and there is literally just 4 seats available. Didn't think that one through much did they? Despite the shitty service and anything else the food was honestly bomb. We loaded our burritos up and whatever you want to add doesn't cost any extra so that's cool. Be careful when you eat it though because they have no bottoms since the seaweed wraps are square and not circles lmao. May or may not come back.
5857,"Hawaiian poké they are not, but they did help to stoke the fire of the NYC poké craze in 2016. Like with BBQ, poké has many imitators, but the best is still found in its place of origin. Pokéworks is a popular choice in NYC though, with lines out the door and roped off, you'd think you were waiting to enter a club on the LES.I've only tried the ahi tuna and salmon, and both were good, but doesn't have the vibrant flavors and freshness like the real island stuff. They can also be stingy during the lunchtime rush. I prefer to create my own bowls, with a fish base and an array of toppings. You can pick add-ons like fried lotus chips, diced mango, masago, surimi salad, avocado, rice puffs, wakame, and the list goes on and on.Hawaiians are purists, using basic sauces to coat the freshest of fishes. A good shoyu or miso or spicy mayo sauce is all they need. In NYC, partly because of the quality of fish and partly because we're so extra, I've gotten used to a mountain of toppings to go with my bowl!"
5858,"Why are the portions so small?! If I knew the $13 I spent for a small salmon poke bowl was not going to make me anywhere close to full, I would've chosen another lunch option. The poke here is not much better nor different than any of the other million poke places in NYC, but the size is definitely smaller.I finished my poke bowl for lunch and my stomach was still grumbling. It was a sad day."
5859,"Apparently large and regular are all the same when it comes to portion size. What separates them is the number of proteins you get to pick - three for large and two for regular. I opted for three. My poke bowl was good, even though there were a few issues. The rice was warm and the choices were decent. However, looks can be deceiving because their quality was not all that great. Instead of large plump scallops, I got bay scallops, which lacks flavor, taste and they were small. Then their tuna was absolutely horrible. It was so full of tissue fibers that I literately had to spit it back out (see photo).  For me, if an establishment is gonna charge the amount they do, which is quite pricey, then they really should get better grades of meat. The service though was good and their customer service was friendly. This is great, but secondary on my list, because my primary concern was their food."
5860,"Really enjoyed my poke bowl...very delicious! Finally came here with a friend after hearing good things about this place. I ordered a regular size poke bowl with brown rice, ahi tuna and salmon and toppings- asked for a little bit of everything (you have the option of choosing as many toppings as you want). The portion was just right. I wanted to try the fried lotus...but too bad they were all out of it.I came here around 7:30ish...and it wasn't crowded, was first in line..but don't expect to eat inside.. I was pretty surprised how fairly small it was inside. Seating is limited, literally only 6 seats on a table against the wall.Excited that another 2 locations are going to open up! Hopefully they will have more seating."
5861,"I love poke, but this was lame. The staff is off-putting. The food portions are so tiny! For $13 a bowl, I expect something more than a kid's size. And the majority of the bowl is the base - either white rice, brown rice, or quinoa - and the actual poke ingredients are like an afterthought. I got the Umami classic bowl and my friend got the Hawaiian classic bowl; we got them to go, and they didn't even mark them, and they're so similar that we had no idea which was which. There are also literally four stools and that's it, so if you come during typical meal hours, there's a slim chance you'll be sitting. My friend and I were still hungry afterwards. Go to Let's Poke instead."
5862,"Delicious, fresh flavors, great customer service and great prices! Similar to Chipotle but with a Hawaiian twist - we tried two different custom bowls with chicken as the protein. I met the owner and he was very kind and assisted me with crafting the bowls. My boyfriend keeps raving about how great the flavor and food was! We will for sure be back"
5863,"Very fast paced environment when I went. Went in around lunch time and everyone was coming and going very quickly as you would imagine what New York City would be like. Quite a bit of wait on the line but the workers were fairly quick to get through it.Just another big sushi roll for me. I ordered off the premade menu and it contained large slices of salmon, seaweed salad, tempura flakes, some type of sauce and nori. You can make your own sushi burrito because the large variety of choices of meats aka the fish and vegetables and toppings to put together."
5864,"Needing a quick lunch on a Saturday afternoon, Pokeworks just opened up and barely anyone inside. Place itself is a bit narrow - order towards the back and eat up front at the ledge if you wish (looks like more of a takeout spot).Did the ""Mix 2"" make your own bowl ($10.50): seared albacore, scallops, cucumber, mango, wasabi aioli, sesame seeds, spicy furikake, and garlic crisps all on a bed of brown rice. Honestly, I was just picking things off the list and hoping it worked together (just felt it would be better value to make your own). Bowl is certainly packed and I like the amount of meat that they give you. Wasabi aioli gives the bowl a nice kick which works really well against the protein. Felt the brown rice was a little chewy (wish I had gotten the white instead). To wash it all down, had a pineapple orange juice which was decent.Considering it was a Saturday, there wasn't too many people coming into the shop, so service was quick. For a fast meal it's good, though not something I'll crave."
5865,"I want to love Pokeworks more but I don't think the quality is there. The fish are cut into irregular chunks, they'd run out of edamame before 6pm, staff don't always seem to know what they're doing. I do like that the toppings of seaweed salad and crab salad are free and options are plentiful but Pokeworks won't be my first choice for poke. Lines were pretty fast every time I've been. Very little seating so eat in Bryant Park instead! Fish is so-so, quality-wise. It's fine but definitely not the best."
5866,"Yikes. What happened to the portion sizes here?Unfortunately for pokeworks, most poke places taste more or less the same to me, which means they're really only competing on price at that point. Either my memory is really bad, or the portion sizes here have gone down quite dramatically. In comparison to pokespot down near union square, this place really doesn't give you much food for the $10.95 pre tax you shell out.If I'm in the Bryant park area for lunch again, I think I'll have to go somewhere else instead."
5867,"My most frequented go-to spot, second only to Starbucks. Don't go on a weekday lunch hour unless you have 2 hours because there is always a line. The reason is simple- pokeworks is a made-to-order salad with the most plentiful variety of options for the pickiest and most discerning eater. You choose a base, protein, mix-ins, sauce, toppings and crunch, all of which consists of about 8 different options. Ogo, hijiki seaweed, scallop, sweet onions, diced mangoes, lotus crisps, and shiso are just a few of the more unique options only available at Pokeworks. With a 25 ingredient salad tossed in any combination of 8 delicious dressings (my favorite: half umami shoyu and half ponzu and a touch of gochujang)- you have your own, completely personalized, buffet-in-a-bowl!For under $12, there is no greater score in the city. Honestly."
5868,"I understand the craze that is a Poke!  So, f you are a sushi lover, visit Pokeworks!My coworker raved about this place and I stumbled across it while handling errands in midtown. I visited mid-afternoon on a Saturday and fortunately there wasn't a line. Its an assembly style setup, which goes by very, very quickly so read the menu before you jump on.  You can either create your own poke or select one of their signature dishes. I selected a signature poke bowl and it was worth every penny. If I could, I would have liked the plastic bowl.  Everything tasted fresh, including the sushi. Average prices for midtown. Average customer service. Delicious food.Happy dining!"
5869,Thanks for the tasty mouth watering bowls!!!! Great spot for a quick healthy bite. Definitely hits the spot. Delicious to eat and filling! Great after my workout! Pokeworks offer a lot with quick friendly service. Looking forward to my return!
5870,"Great food, drinks, service and COVID precautions during winter - what's not to like! I will definitely be returning to this place!Came for brunch on a super cold Sunday without reservations. They have a handful of individual rooms outdoors, all with heaters, and decent air circulation because the rooms don't have doors but plastic strips hanging down. It actually got so hot we asked to turn down the heater. All servers wear masks, even while they're inside making drinks/food. Great service!Mojitos are bomb - both the normal and other flavors they have like passionfruit, mango, coconut.-Got the yuca fries - always yum-Eggs benedict that comes with a bit of smoke salmon (nice touch!) and these are are on like fried quinoa patties instead of bread which is also a nice unique touch!-ceviche that comes with thin crispy plantain chips - a must get IMO!-shrimp with garlic bread - must get too! loved the garlic sauce the shrimp was in"
5871,"Omgosh I absolutely love this place. Came here for a date night during my trip. The staff is AMAZING!! So welcoming and you feel the great energy when you walk in. The food was outstanding, I got the vaca frita was great. The drinks and the meal was all well priced."
5872,I found this gem just exploring the city walking from my hotel. I'm glad I did! I was immediately seated . I opted for outdoor seating because the rain let up a bit. My server came out and was very friendly and knowledgeable. I felt like family not a customer. I started with the Manchester cheese and spinach empanadas and a Cuban sunset. Let me tell you!  ¡Qué rico! I'll probably dream about those empanadas! I had the rabo encendido for my entree. All I can say is this spot is amazing! I'll definitely come back!
5873,"Happy to spend my anniversary at this location. Great food and vibe, the passion fruit sangria was strong and good. Appetizers and main course also on point. The salmon with coconut rice a must get. Bread pudding and guava dessert also a must try. Parking lot across street."
5874,Visited the restaurant yesterday. Not too busy on a Saturday afternoon. We choose the brunch menu and had mimosas which was lovely. We sat outside in their cute outside area. The seating has separate booths for all parties which is great during Covid time and just to have a personal experience. I took two stars off based on the food choices on their brunch menu and food was mediocre. I've been here before for dinner and was better in the past.
5875,"One simple phrase sums up my time at Cuba. Perfection at its best. This is the type of restaurant that makes you want to figure out a way to give it six stars. The atmosphere - Cozy, personal, relaxing. There have a wide range of back rooms and areas for you to sit. Each with their own unique feeling to them. This is the perfect atmosphere to bring a date on. The food - Delicious and authentic. Me and my girlfriend both had the ropa vieja and haven't stopped thinking about it. The drinks - Cuba offers a full bar and anything you can desire will be poured into the perfect glass. My wonderful girlfriend is on a quest to find the perfect mojito, and up to this point, Cuba is a big fish in a big pond. The service - I was treated not as a customer or a patron, but as family. My server was kind, considerate, and very attentive. Everything came out quickly and amazing, even on a busy Friday night!Some of us want to be buried with our loved ones, 2-chainz wants to be buried at the Gucci store, when my time comes, bury me at Cuba restaurant."
5876,"It has been a while since I have been back to this place, but the quality of the food has not changed. Love the outdoor space. Here is what we ordered:-Ropa Vieja which comes with rice, beans, and maduros -Salmon with two shrimp in lobster sauce over coconut rice-Mango mojito-Passionfruit mojitoPortions size is perfect and everything we had was delicious. The food-5 stars, the service-4 stars, and the outdoor space-5 stars. Would I recommend? Absolutely!"
5877,"Was fortunate enough to get sat down in basement when I came here for my reservation for two with half empty restaurant on the ground level. Was confused but shortly put two and two together and realized there was a reason for this. Let's just say the people that were sat downstairs looked very similar to each other and those that were fortunate enough to be treated like humans and be sat upstairs looked more racially acceptable for the area. Not to mention that this basement area room to my knowledge has absolutely zero A/C to my knowledge because I was literally sweating. Now to the service. After being confused on why the hostess took me and my girlfriend to dine in the basement with empty tables clearly visible on the ground floor. I was welcomed with a beautiful 30min wait to even get a waiters attention to see if I would sparkling or still water. I ordered a couple appetizers and none were finished. The papa rellena tasted as if it was fresh outve key food's frozen food aisle. I then order one of their drinks the ""mango martini"" which might as well be some mango syrup mixed with the cheapest liquor you can find drenched with mint flavor. You'd think that at $14 a cocktail you'd get something at least consumable. I suggest the rename it the ""mint martini"" and change the price to $4. Now time for the main course! I ordered the Lechon simply because I thought to myself how can someone mess this up. It arrives and I'm surprised because it's consumable which is a plus I guess so far. Then of course I realize certain parts are warmer then others. Which can only mean they have amazing microwave chefs.... I of course didn't finish this meal like the others served. All said and done I would not recommend coming here and can assure you that there is better Cuban cuisine from street vendors than this place."
5878,"The food is quite authentic, with a good combination of portion size and price. The staff is well mannered and they are always trying to make your experience as pleasant as possible. This is a great addition to this fabulous neighborhood, only one block and half from Washington Square Park."
5879,"Love the vibe and love the love the live music on Thursday night. The servers are all super nice. The food is pretty good and if you are looking for eat something healthy, it's a good place to go. Their cocktail is alright though."
5880,"The food here is mediocre to say the least. What really bothers me the MOST about this establishment is the RUDE staff. From the moment we have walked into this place until we leave, rudeness, unnecessary. Been here twice and that's all I need. The host is RUDE and some of the waiters. The busboys are extremely nice I will say that much. Not worth my time or money, therefore we will not be going back. There are so many other great Cuban spots, I recommend any of those instead. Zero stars would be given unfortunately I have to put something, so the one star will at least be for the busboys (actually they deserve the full 5 stars"
5881,I was at the restaurant with my friends and they food was very expensive for a very small uncooked portions
5882,Went here for brunch on the weekend and was disappointed to see they had taken their brunch items off of the menu! I had the ceviche appetizer and the octopus entree. Both were very tasty! I enjoyed my mojito as well.
5883,The food at this spot was really good. I enjoyed crejientes and the ropa Vieja that I had. The food had a lot of  flavor . And they definitely know how to mix their sangria. I had the passion fruit sangria and it was just right. Not too sweet. This is way better than a few of the Latin restaurants that I have been to recently. I was also very surprised that they had downstairs seating. It was a small room but spacious enough to seat 4 groups of people.  I loved this restaurant I would go back.
5884,"Absolutely love this restaurant. My boyfriend and I discovered it on a random Sunday afternoon and have been going back with friends whenever we can. The ambiance and customer service are great, food is delicious, and so are the drinks. Highly recommend! Make reservations first to avoid a wait especially on a nice day!"
5885,Very delicious Cuban food and fret customer serVice! I'm a tourist and they even helped us out on how to get to the Brooklyn bridge :) will deff come again next timeI'm in town!!
5886,"Had a great time at Cuba! This is the best Cuban food I've had in NYC yet. It is a cozy spot with close together tables but fun vibes when they have live music! Signature mojitos were delicious. Ordered empanadas, croquettes, maduros, and ROPA VIEJA! Surprised we still had room for dessert so we ordered the flan and that was great too! The waiters were attentive and friendly. I never felt like I was rushed or waiting too long for anything. Definitely make a reservation because it gets really busy - especially on a weekend night."
5887,This place was fantastic -- some of the best Cuban food I've had and I would 100% go back again next time I'm in NYC. Great cocktails too and would highly recommend the classic mojito!
5888,"Came here for a birthday brunch with a group of 10 on a Saturday. A few of us were late so unfortunately the ones who arrived earlier had to wait for everyone to start the bottomless.We sat upstairs and the place was really cute but small, we felt a little smushed...but after the second drink we forgot. A lot, of options for drinks so if you're not a mimosa person don't worry. The drinks were strong but very sweet so prepare for a headache.  A lot of options for brunch, everything from your typical brunch food to traditional Cuban dishes. With so much variety I was a little worried about the quality everything would be. Everyone loved what we got from the apps to main courses. The presentation and service was also really good. So food was definitely great, only con were super sweet drinks."
5889,Came here for date night after many great reviews. The service was great and the Resturant was following COVID restrictions. I ordered the Cuban rice which was okay not my favorite but it was tasty. My partner ordered the churrasco which he enjoyed. Resturant is nice and worth a try.
5890,Had dinner here tonight. I had 2 glasses of white wine and a chicken salad. The chicken was incredible! So much chicken comes on your plate. The person I was with ordered churrosco and he loved it. He also ordered a spicy drink and a coffee. Both were really good! 5/5 would recommend. Check it out!
5891,Cuban food for the craving win!I don't recall ever trying Cuban food so I opted for that with my dining partner versus Japanese sashimi and sushi. Yummy and proportionate food servings.  I like the green sauce that was served with the empanadas. Meat was tender and plantains delicious! Service was wonderful and nice white cloth dining tables! Fulfilling craving!
5892,"I REALLY enjoy this place!Some of the best Paella I've ever had!The food here is really good. We typically order the same thing everything, but when it's that good, why order something else?!?We typically always get:3 Empanadas (all three cheese/spinach)Paella ValencianaCoconut MojitoRaspberry MojitoThe empanadas are so good! Between the chicken, beef, and cheese/spinach, hands down the cheese/spinach is the best! And their tomatillo sauce is to-die-for :PThe Valenciana paella is the best choice. It comes with shrimp, chicken, and short ribs. All so good and flavorful!And make sure you get a Mojito... they're delicious!!!of all the mojitos, the coconut one runs away with the victory. If you are feeling something different, the Arroz con Pollo is also really good!If you want some flavorful food for lunch/dinner, come here and get a Paella!"
5893,"The space was big enough to hold walk ins although bustling on a quiet street. Really enjoyed their drinks and food: Had a margarita on the rocks with Cuban corn, paella, and croquets. It was a lot of fun. Service was very attentive!"
5894,"Definitely make a reservation for this place as it gets super packed and can be a tight squeeze. Came here with my boyfriend for a date night, but this place also seemed to be a go to spot for birthdays! We got the paella Valenciana, salmon tartar ceviche, yuca Con mojo, and tostones replenished. Everything was delicious. The paella was packed with seafood and proteins! I would definitely get it again. The salmon tartar was very refreshing. The yuca Con mojo was a stickier texture than I had anticipated, but the garlic flavor was great on it. Great plus was that they had live music going on on a Friday night!"
5895,"Went with a group of 6 friends on a Tuesday night and we got the downstairs community table all to ourselves. One disadvantage of this was that we felt a little neglected toward the end of our meal with slower and slower service. I recommend the duck confit. The mahi mahi was tough and on the dry side but with delicious sauce. For desserts, get the key lime dulce de leche, flan and bread pudding."
5896,"Great Cuban food. I shared the following with two other people and it was more than enough:+ ropa vieja+ one beef and one chicken empanada + mahi mahi+ yuca con mojo+ grilled veggiesThe ropa vieja was definitely the highlight. They were also able to prepare the mahi mahi with the fish sauce on the side for us, since my friend couldn't have dairy. Service was a bit slow but overall I had a great experience!"
5897,I was wondering how good this cuban restaurant was since I live in Miami and have some good Cuban food all around me but was pleasantly surprised. The Food and drinks were pretty good.  I was disappointed at the very small bar thought.  The whole restaurant is pretty small so don't expect a lot of space.  Make reservations ahead to make sure they have a spot for you. The good thing was  that we didn't feel rushed.  We went on a good night when they were giving out a free bacardi drink sample.  It never hurts to have free drinks.  Maybe you get lucky as well!! Lol
5898,"The service in this place is just terrible. The waiter was rude and behaved very dismissive. The remaining staff looked like they had more potential but just followed his lead. The food was just ok but nothing to rave about afterwards on the walk home. Just get Chipotle, at least they welcome you."
5899,"Came here with a few friends and split a bunch of appetizers. The ambience of this restaurant is amazing- reminded me of my time in Cuba! FOODSpinach & Cheese Empanadas - unbelievable. Tasted so good I could've ate atleast 10 of them. The sauce they also come with is sooo yummy.  They come 2 per order, regretted not ordering more! Croquettes De Jamon - didn't personally try, but my friend loved them! Tostones- they were very good, but I've had better. Suggest skipping and saving yourself some calories. Ceviche, quinoa, and yuca (not pictured) - ceviche and quinoa were amazing! The yuca was a bit dry and will definitely not order in the future. Flan - delicious, but very heavy. 5 of us split the tiny little piece! SERVICE The service really made me feel like I was in Cuba as it was so incredibly slow. However, the waiters were very friendly and the food was amazing, which made up for the slow service. Highly recommend checking this place out and experiencing the Havana vibes yourself!"
5900,"We had some travel delays getting to the restaurant and was late for the reservation but that staff was so friendly and accommodating.Our server was also very nice and really helpful when it came to the menu (the entire menu looked delicious and we needed help narrowing down the options). We started with the artichoke dip, which was incredibly delicious. I had the roasted chicken breast with a side of the crispy Brussels sprouts - also incredibly delicious. The chicken was perfectly cooked and all the vegetables and the farro tied the entire dish together perfectly.I wish I had room for dessert! The interior decor was adorable. I felt like we were secluded from the rest of Manhattan in a hidden gem. It was cozy and reminded me of Colorado. Absolute must for get together with friends, date nights and drinks at their bar."
5901,"Not sure what the hype is -- perhaps if ambiance is soooo much more important than food for you. The interior is cute and little italy-y with a lot of nooks and crannies. Came by for brunch and was very underwhelmed by the food, although the cocktails were great. With plenty of other brunch spots in the area, there are better options out there. Seems like a good place for big groups though. We got:- huevos rancheros 7/10: flavors were alright but i think it's super stingy to not have any other protein besides eggs. The dish also came out not very warm- burger 5/10: highly disappointing. It didn't help that the patty was undercooked. For the price of this i'd rather eat 3 big macs."
5902,"Everyone comes to Freeman's for the picturesque alleyway entrance. It's really cute. The place in general is nice, maybe even a little gimmicky. They have outdoor seating in the alley and the inside is dark with a vintage vibe.The food is nothing to rave about but nevertheless pretty good, although I've found it to be a bit inconsistent. The mac and cheese was a hit the last time I was there for brunch. Definitely somewhere to bring out of town visitors for drinks because it's something different."
5903,"Go here. The drinks are phenomenal. We weren't able to eat brunch or dinner because reservations were very hard to get...... which likely means their food is as good as their craft cocktails. However, we were able to have an appetizer with our cocktails - the devil on horseback stuffed jalapeños are legit!"
5904,You never have a bad meal or time at Freemans. It feels like the most perfect hidden gem in the city even though everyone knows about it. To say it's a special place is a huge understatement. The food is as delicious and cozy as the atmosphere as are the expertly made drinks. Our last server Alex is probably the nicest server in all of NYC and made our experience even more enjoyable than normal. Love this place! P.S. Bring back the escarole and beans! I loved that dish and it went away :(
5905,"It's not often to find a perfect brunch/ date spot but freemans has always been and is just that.Adorably tucked into its own alley- it's the most instagrammable picturesque spot that one must go if you'd not yet been. It's location alone is no wonder it's always packed and somewhat of a ""hidden"" gem.That explains why the couples in front of us insisted on waiting for a table inside/out instead of the first come first serve open bar in the taxidermy back of the restaurant, relatively empty area- but we didn't care.Now, let's get to the meat.My ""perfect thyming"" is a dream if you love bourbon or old fashioned. Trust me. My chicken and waffles were doused in a honey sauce topped with deep fried panko thighs and topped with pickled onions, carrots and julienned sweet peppers. It came out looking weird- Weird now synonymous with fcking awesome tasting. Like really freaking delicious. Easily THe best fried chicken and waffles combo in the city, IMHO. It's not the classic one for sure. And if you are allergic to onions peppers or vinegar- Oh, I am so sorry. for you. Honestly. His steak fries were fried so perfectly that launched a whole lesson on how to achieve the perfect fries- tbd. And the burger was nice and rare and melded well into the bun, veggies and cheese- solid for any burger lover. Omg, I dunno what took me so long to visit Freemans. Go already!"
5906,"This is a lovely restaurant tucked at the end of a quaint alley. This eatery is picturesque. I'm sure you've seen the images on insta before!I enjoy eating both outside in the alleyway and inside, both have a very hip vibe. To be honest, I've mostly come here for drinks and snacks but I've always left happy!I love the Devils on Horseback, the fries are pretty good as well as the hot artichoke dip. I definitely want to try a few items off both brunch and the dinner menu. I enjoy their cocktails as well. An espresso martini is always a nice option but I've also tried their Freeman cocktail, which was refreshing and tart. Service has always been good!Definitely a place I'd like to come back to. 4.6/5"
5907,"The location and indoor atmosphere is everything here! As a visitor to NYC this is another of the many places that truly impressed me with its uniqueness!  Fabulous experience!  Don't pay attention to the slow service as it allows you to enjoy the company of those you are with and gives you time to look around!   We started with artichoke dip, crispy bread and 5 cheese macaroni. All were as good as they sound! I ordered the Grilled Black Angus Hanger Steak with Smashed Potatoes and Asparagus.  The smashed potatoes are worth the carbs and calories!  The steak and asparagus were both great sides to the potatoes!  I was stuffed when I left, which allowed me a leisurely after dinner stroll out through the unique alley!  I recommend this as a must do if you have out of town visitors wanting to experience NYC!"
5908,"A must visit as a tourist!!! The food is AMAZING with so many flavors! Usually, I'm not a big fan of big American breakfasts, but this was definitely my favorite. Huevos Rancheros is a MUST order for lunch/brunch.The entire restaurant is also so beautiful! To get to the restaurant, you have to walk through an artsy alley which is perfect for pictures! The inside of the restaurant is designed to be like a home. There's art, couches, different themed rooms etc! It is also great for groups, just book ahead of time!FYI- There's a cancellation fee for reservations!"
5909,"When they say ""Freemans Alley"" is the address, it's literally down an alley to the front door of the restaurant.When making reservations on line be sure to check if you want indoor or outdoor dining. We thought we had made indoor but . . .  Thankfully they were able to accommodate us for an indoor table.It's has a very old hunting lodge feeling inside and it's great! The clientele for the most part are 20-30 somethings.We opted for 2 of the Brunch Specials - neither of them leaving us disappointed. The Poke Bowl was a delicious mix of fresh Tuna, Seaweed, Avocado, Asian Slaw, Cucumbers and Edamame.The fresh Crab Benedict was 2 large portions of crab cake covered with Poached eggs, a light mustard béarnaise sauce with a fresh green salad between them.Definitely a fun destination, with great food, nice staff and ""Graffiti-type"" art work on the walls as you approach their front door.With 2 drinks, tax & tip, the bill came to around $66"
5910,"Love coming here. The service is always great and timely, the drinks are fantastic, and the atmosphere really seals the deal. I'd love to rent out one of the rooms for a wedding party or graduation celebration etc.  in the future.The entrees are where this place loses a star for me. The appetizers both times I came here have been phenomenal, but the entrees are a bit too salty - and yet somehow lack flavor all at the same time. Will definitely come back, but will probably only order a drink and some apps."
5911,"I'm going to start with the things that I liked, atmosphere, food, music, drinks, fair prices, decent portions. Decoration was very cozy and comfy, food was well prepared, served and very tasty, my drink wasn't the best that I've had but was good enough. For food I would have given 5 star, 6 if possible to be honest. We had the artichoke dip, hamburger and Mac & cheese, and everything was very good. Their lunch menu is limited and looks more like a brunch menu with different types of eggs and sweet entrees. What has room to improve is the service, we had a reservation, the place was almost empty and the hostess offered to seat us at what could have been the worst table of the place, small, against a wall, next to the entrance, in the middle of circulation. I requested a different one and she gave us another option, I just wish she had better criteria. I ordered a drink that never came to the table, the server came when we finished eating to pick up plates and mentioned that he forgot, I didn't really cared or wanted it at that moment so we ordered the check, and 4% COVID recovery charge was added to the bill... !!???I would recommend for the food. I usually don't get upset for poor service, so I will be coming back, maybe I'll ask for bar sitting instead, dinner menu looks really appealing and I really wanna try it."
5912,Waited 2+ hours for entree. Food was tepid and really average for the expense. Complained to manager about the crazy wait time and did not even comp a round of drinks. Service is lack-luster and food is average. I really wanted to like this place
5913,"I want to like Freeman's. But I've come to the conclusion that all I like is the decor and nothing else. I came here during Covid last year and it was tolerable because it was nearly empty.I'm sitting here right now. I showed up 40 minutes ago and I just got the drinks I ordered. Our appetizer hasn't shown up. Our waiter keeps saying ""The music is so loud, I'm sorry I couldn't hear you. Can you confirm your orders?""  Just admit bro that you forgot our entire order because you didn't write anything down. Our waiter hasn't acknowledged the long wait for everything at all and is being ""overly"" nice and trying to ignore the elephant in the room. Fuck being nice. Do your job, serve my food and get on with it. Labor shortage, covid, whatever the excuse is - I'm over it. Just do your job and enough with the bullshit. Also this place isn't cheap and the service is beyond horrendous. If you're an Instagram hoe and looking for something ""super cool to do in NYC""  then you'll eat this place up (if your food shows up in the first place). If you're looking for a nice meal and good service, go literally anywhere else. Taco Bell has better service than Freeman's."
5914,"Woof. This place is positively average. A massive bummer. I've been wanting to come here for about 6 years. I had to book a private dinner for an ex-boss and fell in love. I swore to myself when I had the cash and the reason, I would make it out.Well, I been had the cash -- recently got a reason, so we headed down town for date night. We had a reservation for the inside dining room but the outdoors were packed. They really have done well for the outdoor seating. Most people call this a hidden gem, but this place is one of the most popular spots in NYC. I remember when this was actually low-key. (Am I showing my age?) It must have shown up on somebody's instagram or in TimeOut.  Let's be real Freemans is not hidden away. There's even a sign at the end of the alley...I think a lot of people are so in love with the idea of ""finding something hidden"" they inflate their ratings. Which is fine, I love a good aesthetic, but I can't eat or drink it.We were sat in the middle area that's a massive dead spot which tied into our later problem of slow service.We sat around for a while, (seemingly a very common exp based on other reviews) and then got our water and then 10 minutes later our waiter came around? It may seem pedantic, but gosh I really do hate when waiters aren't in a consistent uniform? This dude came up in a plaid shirt and for the first 15 seconds we were just smiling at each other like, ""Hey."" I really just thought he was a random dude saying what's good.We ordered two cocktails, the mezcal espresso martini and the chartreuse martini. They took 15 minutes to arrive and when they did they came ungarnished and watered down. (The waiter ran back with three olives on a stick and was like, ""Oh sorry we forgot!"")This should have been a sign, we were debating whether to send them back but the waiter again was missing for 10 minutes. Not to mention the bartender was looking bored out of his mind and working slow as heck. For starters, Devils on Horseback (12) and Mussels (22)Devils on Horseback are four greasy thick bacon slices wrapped over cheese and fig. They were incredibly filling and I wouldn't suggest them to anyone there to actually eat. The mussels were fantastic. Actually the best thing we had.The food took a while and again we were sat there with our bad cocktails and finally decided to just suck it up and we would try something else for our next round.Again, more sitting around. More waiting. We were in a dead zone so I kind of get it. But it's not the first time ever anyone has sat there. They should know to check in on those tables. The couple sitting next to us also had the same problem.Our dinners were the Duck Confit special (38) and the Steak. (39)Both average. Over salted, still edible but not BLOW AWAY amazing. I kind of expected it to be at least a, ""Wow that's good."" Or next drinks were a 22 dollar glass of wine (lol) and the Freemans cocktail. They must have realized we were getting annoyed because the wine came quick and the bartender hand delivered the Freemans. Which was good, but again meh forgettable. The whole thing was 230 including tip.So overpriced food for an average place. You're paying an upcharge for their ""hidden gem quality"" God, I wish I could love this place but they are slacking. They had fallen prey to their own success and have melted into mediocrity. If you want a legitimate good food/drink experience, skip this. If you're looking for instagram fodder and it's your first week in NYC -- enjoy FreemansForgot to add - There is a 4% Covid cover charge. The largest I've seen so far."
5915,"Freemans has been in its unique spot for a while now, it's a favorite of mine. That said, the whole place felt tired when I had dinner with a friend this past summer. I mean, the city itself is slow & quiet during the summer, and as the pandemic still hangs on, everyone is exhausted. But this was in evidence at Freeman's, and as compared to previous visits, it's just not the same. I'm probably being unfair ... I'll go back again some day, I just hope Freeman's regains the spring in its step ..."
5916,"Really cool location through the back of an alley. Also loved the interior decorating of the restaurant, very eclectic. It was packed during lunch, so we were lucky they found us a table.The chicken and waffles was tasty, the chicken more than the waffle. The pickled slaw really helped balance the sweetness. I also ordered a Bloody Mary which wasn't listed on their drink menu. It was disappointing!"
5917,"It's easy to miss as it's at the end of an alleyway but once you get there, it's a hidden gem in the middle of LES. Outside is like an oasis (reminiscent of Diagon Alley if you get the reference) while inside it's dimly lit like a dive bar, it's very intimate and cozy. Came here on Sunday for brunch. While we were originally going to order mimosas, the waiter recommended their cocktails (which in his opinion were much better). We love a good recommendation so we ordered the Sunday Morning Cooler and the Summer Water. WOW! If you want a light drink for brunch, I highly recommend the Sunday Morning Cooler (tastes like lychee). The Summer Water was too heavy with tequila for my taste. Side note: they only have espresso and regular coffee (wished they had more options for those who don't drink alcohol)For food, we ordered the huevos rancheros (with avocado), wild berry buttermilk pancakes and the Freemans cheeseburger. One of the best huevos rancheros I've ever had. It was crispy, creamy, flavorful - everything you want for brunch. The cheeseburger was also very good - decadent, high fat percentage (you'd want to take a nap after). The pancakes were also amazing - the perfect amount of sweetness, tartness and acidity to counteract the flavors. I would come again definitely! The service there was impeccable, and the food and drinks were above and beyond my expectations!"
5918,"This place is a little bit hidden but it holds some good food. We had deviled eggs as appetizers and some of their bowls as our main dishes. The wine list is diverse enough and we found some good options for self poisoning. The service was good and the atmosphere was uniquely cool, with the exception of the dead animals on the walls."
5919,"Y'all have seen Freeman's restaurant on every content creator's insta. Trust me when I say they food is as good as they look!I went with a couple of friends on a late Sunday morning. We didn't have reservations, but it wasn't too hard to get a place to sit. The decor inside is super lovely and homey. I got the chicken and waffles, and my other companions got the salumeria hash. The pancakes were definitely a hit - perfect amount of sweetness and fluffiness. The chicken and waffles were also a perfect amount of crispy with a great accompanying sauce to pull the meal together. Lastly the hash was pretty well done. Not our favorite, but the bar was set so high. Service was also amazing too!"
5920,"Tucked away restaurant inside an alley off of Rivington Street. Cool outdoor setup of tables alongside art-covered walls, plants, as well as plenty of lighting. Saturday late afternoon, was able to snag a table for two without any wait.Menu is definitely $4-5 more expensive than your normal spots, though you are paying for the off-the-beaten-path vibe. To drink  ordered the French 75 ($16) - a refreshing cocktail consisting mainly of gin, sparking wine, lemon and juice. Not as strong as I would have had expected and much of the cocktail consisted of ice. For food, decided to split the Hot Artichoke Dip ($18) - a large baked bowl of tangy/sweet artichoke, served alongside toasted bread slices. Loved the even crust on top and the quick punch of flavor. Best when eaten hot, as it became more greasy towards the end when it cooled.Service here started off well but tapered off as more people came for dinner. Cool ambiance here for the warmer days if able to get a seat outside."
5921,"A must try in NY! Highly recommended to make reservations (as you should for any other restaurant). We ordered some cocktails, spring bowl and full English breakfast. The spring bowl had scrambled eggs, caramelized onions, feta, farro, avocado, side salad topped with salsa verde and crispy tortillas. The dish was so flavorful and delectably light. The scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly, so fluffy but still kind of runny and just delicious. I got to try my friend's potatoes from her breakfast and the outside was nice and crispy. I highly recommend this place for good food and craft cocktails with awesome vibes."
5922,"Freeman's hosted our company holiday party and they did an amazing job. The location is unique (off an alley) and the decor is kind of like a modern barn (complete with animal heads on the wall). We had a variety of family style apps, entrees, and desserts to pass and everything was great. Cocktails were awesome too. Honestly don't have anything negative to say! If you're looking for a good private room experience for a group of 10 to 20, definitely put Freeman's on your short list to check out."
5923,Very rustic decor and great spot for large party brunches! The cocktails were great! I got the Saturday Matinee and the fried chicken and waffles. The fried chicken was amazing but I didn't quite like the bacon cheddar waffle. Service was good and we did not feel rushed.
5924,"** UBE ALERT **Skip the mezcal and go straight for this new contender! Also, there's oat milk in this fun drink, thoughtful for those that can't drink dairy!"
5925,"Decided to try this place for brunch while the weather was still nice out. I made a reservation for 2:15PM on a Saturday thinking it would be busy. We got there 20 minutes early and they seated us immediately. We chose outdoor dining, which is outside freeman's alley. The alley is a quaint little area between rivington and bowery Street. Adequately spaced tables tuckered in the alley with interesting and sometimes hilarious graffiti on the walls can be seen.The menu is viewed by using a QR code, minimizing interaction with anything high touch. We opted for the chicken and waffles, the burger (ordered medium rare), and a side of thick cut bacon.Food came relatively quick. The chicken and waffles was deliciously made. Cheddar waffles was soft and the Chipotle honey and syrup added just enough sweetness without it being overpower. The chicken was juicy and not dry. The burger was also a winner. Burger was medium rare and extremely juicy, went well with the sauce. The fries were amazingly crunchy.The only disappointment would be the thick cut bacon. I've had thick cut a bacon a few times and expected them to be actually thick, but what came out was 3 strips of what appears to be normal bacon. I felt this was definitely not worth the $10 price tag. But overall the meal was great.Worth a visit and definitely a cute date spot for dinner."
5926,"Literally a hidden gem at the end of Freeman alley -- excellent service, food, and atmosphere!Showed up for lunch around 3pm on a Saturday without any reservation, but despite that, my friend and I were promptly seated by the host who was super welcoming and accommodating. There are both indoor and outdoor seatings available, all spaced out far apart along with other Covid guidelines such as temp checks and contact tracing met. When we were seated, our waiter promptly set up the table with utensils and water. Gave us couple mins to look over the menu and took our orders :) really appreciated that he was very attentive throughout the entire time there, making sure our water was topped off and empty plates were cleared off the table. We ordered off the brunch menu -- huevos rancheros (fried beans with scrambled eggs, tortillas, rice, and add-on chicken) and the freeman cheeseburger (medium-well with sautéed onions, cheese, and pickles) and a side of fries. Not a fan of pickles so I should've mentioned that instead of waisting all 5 of 'em... The meal was very well-seasoned and absolutely delicious! If you're looking for something sweet, that's also available on the brunch menu such as pancakes and waffles. Additionally, the prices were reasonable for the portions they served. For reference, we had two dishes for a total of $50!Overall, I highly recommend Freeman's if you're up for some quality food, service and dining experience!"
5927,"First thing that blows you away about this place is it's gorgeous location. Situated at the end of a beautifully graffitied alleyway, it gives such a oasis in a desert vibe. The staff was kind when speaking to us but unfortunately wasn't as attentive as we hoped. We tried to call the waitress multiple times to order more wine but didn't succeed. Food was delicious, we had steak, chicken, some apps, all great. My only issue was that the mahi mahi was barely 4 bites of fish. Extremely small and hidden under the salad. It tasted amazing, we just expected more for the price."
5928,"It was a very cute area in an alleyway-super cute. I got the alley Margarita which was super good and had a bit of a kick, similar to a jalapeño Margarita. I was super impressed with their Mac n cheese, and basically devoured it with my friend due to the taste and crunchiness. I was fairly disappointed with my burger though in that it tasted burnt and I don't think it was the best dish I could've gotten. I wanted some of the Margarita to go, but it took them almost half an hour to locate a vessel to even put the drink in...the service was also not that great and didn't really update us on the status and we constantly had to find someone to serve us."
5929,"Cute spot with a really nice vibe and amazing cocktails. Would recommend for a weekend brunch and big groups. The food was nothing super exciting but the cocktails will definitely make up for it. Overall, a good time!"
5930,"- Came for brunch at 10:50 and there was already a line down the alleyway, so make a reservation days in advance! - Menu seems limited. I don't think there's something here for everybody. - Prices are a little outrageous. - Artichoke dip was not good. Definitely don't get. How do you mess that up? - I got the huevos rancheros with chicken, and thought it was so tasty and filling, but it is smaller than it looks because of the presentation. My cousin got the brisket and grits and enjoyed it. The grits were not bland at all! - David, our waiter, was so sweet! He was super busy, so we had to track him down a couple times, but he was helpful and honest when it came to the menu. - food was enjoyable, but Americana atmosphere and taxidermy decor seems to be the main attraction. It's a pretty popular place for brunch, so if you wanna spend a bit more for inventive dishes and a fun alley walk, go for it!"
5931,"We were visiting our daughter from out of town. We just love everything about the food, drinks, and atmosphere.We would come back again when we are in town."
5932,"What a surprise find this was at the end of an alley in SoHo. I was only able to stay for 2 cocktails and a snack, but all of those were lovely and fun."
5933,"Came here for brunch one lovely Saturday. Arrived around 12:15 with a party of 2 and were seated immediately. But before I get into details with the restaurant, I want to talk about the entrance. This establishment is located adjacent to Chinatown down a long alley surrounded by apartments and the most amazing graffiti. If you don't come here to eat, it is worth the walk to see all the art, but I do recommend coming here for food too.When you walk in, the design is very eclectic with pictures and stuffed heads on the wood paneling wall. There are small tables and a few large ones, a bar area to sit in the front. Then as you walk through, there is another room which has more tables and (yes) a second bar. This 2nd room is also where the restrooms are.. one in either side of the bar. When we sat down our waiter quickly came over with water and to ask if we needed anything. We started with a mimosa and for a meal I got chicken and waffles. The waffles have cheddar and bacon within the batter which was very very subtle - would love to have had more bacon within the batter or a little bacon piece on top . There was a good amount of fried chicken and it was very moist. I would have liked to have had a little bit more waffle but it was a good meal. On top of the fried chicken was spicy pepper which I ended up having to take off because I'm wimpy with spice. Overall, it was a really good ambiance, it wasn't too loud, food was good, and the waiters are very attentive and quick. We were probably there for an hour, or maybe a little less, but we never felt rushed."
5934,"I wanted to love it, but why is everyone so nasty? And making it so very clear they wanted everyone out by the end of the night. Literally leaving the door open (20 degrees outside) and dragging garbage back and forth. Putting barstools up while people are still dining. The waitress had a bad attitude. Asked if anyone wanted another round and walked away without getting my friends order. The bartender too... pretentious. Beautiful place, bad vibes."
5935,So giving this a 3 because I liked the vibe -- but I'd give this a 2 for the food. I was with a party of 6 for dinner -- had the steak which was OK -- passable. The rest of the table had starters -- everyone seemed to be ok with their food but nothing was great. The bill was picked up by a gracious friend -- I got the feeling it was outrageously expensive for what it was. I will likely not return unless it's for lunch for a burger maybe (?). I was excited to go and sadly this did not live up to my modest expectations. I had been here years ago when it first opened and had good memories
5936,I hadn't been here in over a decade and I was nervous that it wouldn't be as good as I remembered it...I had memories of ordering two artichoke dips because one just wasn't enough...and thank goodness it's still amazing! Food and ambience are the best. Pork chop is so good but I could do without it being overloaded with Shishido peppers - it needs a vegetable and/or carb that is more appealing to a wider audience. Steak - amazing. Artichoke dip - the best on the planet. Wine - a bit pricey for what you get but that's normal for Manhattan.
5937,"Context:  My friend and I were seated without a wait on a Friday at 1 pm.  The restaurant was not very full at all, but I've heard the wait can get quite long on weekends.  Service/Atmosphere:  It's so fun that you have to duck into a colorful grafitied alley way to get to the restaurant!  Just walk through the bright blue door, it cannot be missed.  The inside is illuminated in dim lighting and covered in vintage decor; the antique visuals gives the most lovely comforting, homey feeling.  The service, however, was extremely SUBPAR.  I would've given it a pass if the restaurant was crowded, but it was half empty and they did not look understaffed.  It first took forever for the server to come take our order after he seated us.  Then when we asked for additional hot sauce, he completely forgot.  He later said he told someone else to do it, but this just illustrates bad communication between the staff.  The bill also didn't come until I flagged down a completely different waiter.  We were just sitting there twiddling our thumbs long after we had finished our meal.  A huge part of the problem was the server never once thought to check up on our table during the entire meal.Food:  As for the food itself, the menu offers very classic American brunch options.  I ordered the french toast and my friend ordered the egg white omelette.  Both were not mind-blowing dishes, but they tasted great for a hearty brunch.  Final Thoughts:  I rate this more as 3.5 stars, a full star docked for quality of service, and half a star for taste of the food.  I would still give this another chance to see if this experience was a fluke."
5938,"Overall a great dinner spot. Food is good, nothing to blow you away but they make up for it with the ambiance and service. I'm actually shocked so many reviews say the service was poor because our waiter was so overly friendly and attentive and our food and drinks did not take long at all. We got the spinach dip and skirt steak and both were solid choices and portions were large."
5939,Edgar the bartender was the absolute best! Very friendly and makes excellent drinks. Would give 10stars
5940,"We had a private event in the Blue Room and had a fantastic time. The family style menu had great choices, the food was delicious, and the service was perfect. Romero was extremely helpful and ensured that we always had plenty of wine. He even checked in with us to see how we wanted to pace the entrees after the appetizers, which was nice because we wanted to relax and enjoy our drinks before more food came out. It was a perfect experience and we will definitely be back. Highly recommend for private events!"
5941,"Solid brunch spot in the heart of LES. They won't seat you until your entire party is there, which is fairly common for NYC, but I was slightly annoyed because there were countless tables open at 10:30 AM on Sunday.The vibe of the restaurant reminds me of a secluded, cabin library in the heart of the woods. Upon walking in, you'll see that there is not much natural light; they have wooden floors, walls, and ceilings; and there are mounted animal heads. I love the ambiance and vibe.We started with iced coffee, and a few of the girls got bloody Marys. They didn't have flavored syrup for the coffee, just regular creamer, but it was good. The bloodies were good too, and not that spicy.We shared the banana pancakes for the table (came with 3), and it was WOW! I gobbled every bite. They had a very, very mild banana flavor (which I liked), and the nuts on top just made the whole dish. We split one order for the table of 5, and it was the perfect amount as an ""appetizer"".For mains, I got the mushroom eggs Benedict, which was quite delicious. My only qualm with it was the price ($24), which is usually what I would pay for lobster or crab Benedict. This one had no meat, so I'm not sure why it was the most expensive brunch item on the menu. Nonetheless, the truffle hollandaise was great, and the poached eggs were cooked well, although slightly underdone. It came with greens, and I asked for lemon vinaigrette to make a nice salad.The rest of the table got the English breakfast, and one got the skillet. Those who got the English breakfast said the beans were fantastic, and overall it was good. My friend who got the skillet said that it was very average, and she probably wouldn't get it again.We ended up staying and chatting for about an hour AFTER the check came, and although they had gotten busy at that point, they didn't pressure us out whatsoever. Major points with me; one of my least favorite things is being rushed out of a restaurant. Service was great; food was good (overpriced); and decor was great. Will be back again, maybe for dinner next time!"
5942,"My brother highly recommended Freemans and made a reservation for five of us on his birthday weekend. So, despite the small menu, I had high hopes. We were seated immediately as we had a reservation. Then, water was brought to us immediately. Then...fingers tapping...fingers tapping...fingers tapping...nothing. We waited and waited and waited. Good thing we were already tipsy! Finally, we asked a passing waiter if someone was going to be our server. He said he would look into it and then I saw him notify other employees. Afterwards, we...waited. We enjoyed each other, BUT we kept waiting...again. I then got up, went to the host stand and asked for a manager. The manager came to our table fairly immediately and we asked if we had a waiter/waitress. She said yes, but said she would attend to us immediately.  She did attend to us immediately, BUT when we notified the first waiter that we needed attention, he approached her and appeared to tell her and no action was made. Service was okay after the manager started to help us. We ordered drinks, asked for bread and got the five cheese macaroni appetizer.  Everything came out in a timely manner. The Mac and cheese was well cooked, with nice flavor and gooey cheeses. For dinner three people got filet mignon (with sweet & sour onions, mashed potatoes and horseradish creme fraiche). My hubby got the grilled Berkshire pork chop (with grilled asparagus and fennel-cubanelle salsa) and I got the half roasted Amish chicken (with fiddle heads, sugar peas and black garlic butter & herbs). The food was all QUITE good. My brother's girlfriend COULD NOT stop talking about the sweet and sour onions with her steak. She literally MADE my hubby and I try them. They were a mixture between crunchy and soft - perfectly cooked. The flavor was unmatched. The steaks were all perfectly cooked, soft and seasoned really well. My hubby's pork chop was off the chain. My sugar peas were so damn good. Like a crunchy snack. I told the manager it was my brother's birthday and he got a brownie and ice cream. It was a thick, dense and a good brownie. Overall, the food was great. However the service was thumbs down. Unfortunately, I would not come back unless someone else was picking up the tab."
5943,"5/5 experience. The entire restaurant is beautifully decorated to feel quaint and elegant. We sat inside on the first floor and explored the upstairs when we finished our meal. We would come back just to sit upstairs. The food was very good. We started with a salad which we enjoyed. My boyfriend ordered the duck, I ordered the mahi mahi and we shared the fries. Food is good but the elegance of the restaurant is what would bring me back. Very sweet waitress too!"
5944,"My previous two reviews were about brunch at Freemans, but on my latest trip to NYC we had dinner at the Dutch few blocks west, and wanted a night cap for drinks not at a club though and we decided to check out Freemans. The place was full on a Saturday night but they have two bars. One in the front of the restaurant and another in the other room to the right next to the bathrooms. We snatched the last two seats at this bar and it was so coool!!! They have a variety of specialty drinks, one they actually lit a lemon peel on fire and it was really fun. The place felt really cozy like you were in a dark, very old house back in early NYC days. There is nothing like this where i live. I would recommend coming here for drinks in the evening if you can find a seat. Worth it. Great people watching."
5945,Came here on a whim since I was in the area and thought it was decent. They ran out of the chicken & waffles and burgers so I was kinda bummed. I had the huevos rancheros and it was pretty good. I don't think I'd come here again just because it was a little basic in terms of what they offered but it's a decent brunch place if you're just looking for somewhere to go. No complaints but also nothing to rave about. Decor was cute though!
5946,"We came for lunch time apps and drinks- we got the charcuterie board and the artichoke dip. The charcuterie board was good, but didn't come with any cheese ? Also it was $32 which seemed steep to me. The artichoke dip was amazing and was baked almost like a soufflé . Highly recommend getting that .Overall it was cute and quaint !"
5947,Really not that great. Food was very average and plain and service was really poor and unfriendly.
5948,Cool ambience and decor. Horribly dry waffles and awful service (very slow and rude staff).
5949,"Probably my favorite overall theme and feel of any restaurant. From the wall behind the bar to the taxidermy to the old speakers, everything goes perfect together. Feels you are in a lodge upstate NY. I came here for brunch and decided to try the special, filet mignon hash. Such flavor! I loved the tender steak with the soft potatoes and runny eggs.   Also the skillet eggs were top notch. Add bacon and cheese, any other way would be wrong. And...the pancakes were pretty bomb as well.I can't wait to come back for more."
5950,"The waitress Jay was AMAZING!!! The food was great, drinks were amazing and she even noticed it was my friends birthday from checking ID and brought over a birthday drink to sing happy birthday!"
5951,"What a fun joint and a must try in NYC!  Colourful dining rooms, great tunes and friendly service.  Had their famous chicken and waffles, $20 and enjoyed the cheesy béchamel and Cholula honey!"
5952,"We came to Mom's as a party of four, on Sunday December 26th at 10:30am with a reservation.We were seated inside, and given a choice of indoors or outdoors.  This place was spectacular!  The service was fast, the food was good, the meal was not rushed and the price was right.  I started with the Blackberry Sangria, yum!  My main entree was the Mac n Cheese Pancakes.  This was a large serving of Pancakes, three big ones if I recall correctly.  The pancakes were smothered with Mac N cheese and also some kind of honey drizzle.  They were fantastic and very filling.I would definitely come back to Mom's again!  It ranks high in my book in a convenient location to everything in the Hell's Kitchen area."
5953,"Flew in from Houston TX. We looked up places to eat in the area where we stayed. This place was really good. The wait time was less than what they initially said which was a bonus. The staff was really well. We were served by Sarah. She was best server we have experienced in the city. She checked in on us often. Made sure we felt welcome. Gave us options and helped us decide on what we wanted to eat. Awesome bartender. I recommend this restaurant for friendly service l, great atmosphere, and really good food. Plus the music soundtrack never was boring. They mixed it up pretty well. Thanks. Will be back when I'mIn town."
5954,"The music is too loud; it's trying too hard to be a club with music so loud people have to talk loud to be heard at the table.The burger patty here has this weird aftertaste like some kind of freezer burn or spoiled meat or iffy quality. It's overpriced for what it is.The fries were served soggy. I could shake them and they would swivel them because they were so soft. Fries, regardless of exterior color, should be crispy!While the service was super friendly, it doesn't make up for the food flavor."
5955,"Went here for an afternoon brunch on a Sunday. The wait was about an hour for two people. You will have to go into the restaurant to join the waitlist and they don't do reservations, but the wait was worth it.I was excited to try the chicken and waffles here since they served them with a cheesy sauce on top. Normally, I find that chicken and waffles tend to be dry, but these are next level chicken and waffles. They aren't dry since they have that cheesy sauce and the flavors combine together so nicely. They served the bacon on top with the chicken, and not mixed in the waffle as described. We also ordered the gymbod breakfast which was pretty good. As a drink, I ordered the bobbing for apples in theme for fall. This was large and delicious.The service was excellent and had a lively atmosphere. Overall, this is a great brunch option."
5956,"I have been here a bunch for brunch but this was only my second time coming for dinner! It definitely lived up to what I remembered! My mom and I came here on Labor Day. We were seated inside right away. Our server was great and let us take our time deciding. We never felt rushed!To drink, I got the frose. I love that the drinks come in a mason jar and with crazy straws. It's a cute addition! To start, we split the buffalo chicken mac and cheese balls. OMG were these amazing! They were perfect to share and I loved the buffalo ranch dipping sauce. To eat, we both got the fried chicken sandwich. It was delicious! I loved the garlic aioli. Definitely ask for an extra side of it to dip your fries in. It's awesome! There is a TON of chicken on this sandwich. It's almost big enough to share. We unfortunately didn't have room for dessert, but I definitely want to come back and try their fun milkshakes!The theming of the restaurant goes perfect with the type of food they have here. Definitely a fun spot for brunch or dinner!"
5957,"Looking for a brunch place in Hells Kitchen we came across Mom's Kitchen and Bar. It was a good experience however there were a couple downsides. Upon getting to the restaurant, there was a 45 minute wait for a party of 4. The wait was longer than the expected wait time and when they said the table was ready we had to wait for them to clean off the table. When we finally sat down, the service for waters and orders took longer than expected, perhaps the restaurant was busier or understaffed for that day but it didn't give us the best first impression. When we finally ordered the food, luckily the food came in at a good speed and they tasted fresh. Everything tasted fresh and the servings were greatly proportioned. I would certainly come back due to the good food and the convenience of the location. To people who are coming here around Sunday brunch time, make sure to have a snack prior!"
5958,Amazing and elevated comfort food!! Came for my mom's birthday and if def exceeded expectations
5959,"This place truly has my heart. Its a must every time I come to New York. I couldn't believe I never did the review. I noticed now because it was so good I decided to bring my friends. From the food down to the service everything is amazing. The wait is a bit long because it's such a popping place but trust you will not be disappointed. The servings are huge and you will be in a food coma. The pancakes, the steak and eggs and my absolute favorite the chicken and waffles with the delicious honey butter. All drinks are bomb but my fave is the poppa does peach with crown royal peach and an actual peach ring inside. I throw the peach ring inside and let it soak up all the alcohol and eat it last lolTry this place if you can it's amazing"
5960,Nice spot. Great service. Cammy was great. And the food was spot on. And OMG! THE BEST BACON! You can go plain or fancy with your breakfast choice. Either is great.
5961,"Wife & I came for breakfast after seeing all the great reviews. We had like a 10 min wait, which wasn't bad for a Sunday morning. Staff was friendly and we didn't wait long for our food and the place was packed. Menu had lots of good sounding options, but the sweet tooth kid in me opted for the Bedrock Pancakes. I was in all my glory as this was everything I hoped for and more. I mean fruity pebbles in big fluffy pancakes topped with blueberries and strawberries. Seemed like everyone around us was getting the same thing. I'll say it's probably a staple here. My wife got the woodland omelet and loved it. It was a ton of food and she couldn't finish it. We had to split the How the Grinch Stole Christmas seasonal shake. It was insanely good, mint chocolate chips and vanilla ice cream with green sprinkles. Breakfast for two of us came to $50+"
5962,AMAZING!!! This was our favorite stop in NYC. We ordered the Bedrock pancakes and the Mac and cheese pancakes. Both were outstanding! Not a bite was left. The Mac and cheese pancakes sound strange but they are so worth it. I was completely full afterwards but I couldn't pass on the holiday special shake: The Grinch Who Stole Christmas. I may have felt sick for a few minutes afterwards due to the crazy amount of sugar- but it passed and I have no regrets! That shake was amazing and again- not a bite was left. Run to Mom's!!!
5963,"Okay, this was GOOD!!! Thank you Justin for the pancake burrito recommendation . We had a variety of selections: chicken and bacon waffles; avocado toast revamp and breakfast sandwich. I vote my pancake burrito and chicken and bacon waffle was hands down the best!  Please try this place while in NYC"
5964,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!  My boyfriend and I decided to go here last weekend for brunch, after reading other reviews about it online. We had an amazing time and well worth the 1hour wait for table. They do not take reservations and it is first come first serve. We did not want to waste our appetite on an appetizer, so we just went straight to entree... and we were not disappointed. I got the pancake burrito (no bacon) and BA Mojito with a side of Texas toast and my boyfriend got the mamas burger. That was the best damn meal I ever had. 1) it was the right amount of food 2) the idea of a breakfast burrito with the pancake wrapped around the egg and cheese with melted cheese on top covered in syrup and chives... is amazing....3) the Texas toast is just great.. idk if it was fresh baked but  it tasted like it... My boyfriend enjoyed his meal as well but my burrito was literally amazing so I'm really just going to focus on my meal lol if you are planning on coming to this place, please order the breakfast pancake burrito. The drinks were great. Perfect amounts of each ingredient. I usually get a few drinks at dinner, so the BA Mojito was the perfect size and it came with a rubber ducky! The staff was very friendly and the decor of the restaurant is cute! I am definitely coming back again!"
5965,"Food and service was soo good and worth the 40 minute wait. We ate outside in the heated seating area, which was cozy and warm. $37"
5966,"LOVED this place! The one thing I really look for when going to a place is how the staff treat people. Moms kitchen was wonderful. We got there and there was a bit of a wait, but it passed by very quick! We were seated outside which was heated and not uncomfortable at all. Our waitress was absolutely sweet! She was taking care a lot of tables yet she was still extremely friendly and very attentive. She got everything right, and was very patient with the kids too. I feel horrible that I forgot her name, but thank you to her!!!! Food was very good too, can't complain there at all. I highly recommend the chicken and bacon waffle! They also had some alcoholic beverages that sounded greatttt but we were there strictly for breakfast so we skipped out on that part! Lol"
5967,"Prepare to be in a food coma...a delicious one!!! I had the chicken and waffles and the chicken was seasoned very well. My friend ordered the Mac & Cheese pancakes and OMG, that's all I can say for that one!"
5968,This place was truly amazing. It was so delicious and our server was beyond amazing. Jay had the best recommendations on their menu and the best recommendations on things to do around the neighborhood. Hot tea was perfect for my throat as I had lost my voice from screaming at a drag show the night before. Our server was so kind to find a tea for me. For brunch I had the Tomato Soup which was delicious and perfect for the chilly weather. It felt amazing on my throat but also helped keep me warm under the heaters. I also had the Pancake Burrito which was a one of a kind experience. It was so delicious with the sausage and egg that were stuffed inside the pancake. It was a perfect recommendation from the server. Then I finished off brunch with a delicious Red Sangria which was served in a cute mason jar with a rubber ducky. The sangria was fresh and the fruit was a perfect topping. I will definitely check this place out again whenever I find myself in New York.
5969,"Calling all sweet- lovers!! Amazing brunch spot with great food, portions and prices!! Got the bedrock pancakes and the rainbow bright bigmouth shake. Bedrock pancakes: Soft, moist pancakes with heaping mounds of whipped cream and delicious fruity pebbles, berry maple syrup and more than enough berries. The ton of fruit helped us feel a bit healthier, but ultimately, this is a sweets-lovers dream. Every bite was full of sugary flavors (both artificial from the fruity pebbles, and natural from the fruit) and fluffy pancake.Rainbow bright: This shake is ridiculously large. I shared with my sister and we couldn't even finish it. There's a later of lemon icing on the side that helps keep the fruity pebbles stuck to the side. Would not recommend eating that straight as it is straight up sugar and a bit overwhelming. Maybe that's obvious whoops. Drink itself is insanely cute with a little lollipop sticking out of the side. There's a strong milky cereal flavor throughout - yum! Having both dishes together was honestly very sugary, even for me, so I might share with someone else who gets something more savory next time. Every dish I tried was amazing though and the portions were pretty hefty, especially if you're getting a drink. Will be coming back for sure to try the rest of their menu!!"
5970,"I took my sister here to celebrate her birthday on Tuesday 2/15/2022. I honestly was blown away. In the words of my sister I have never been to a place where everything tasted good. We ordered the rose pomegranate mojito that our waitress suggested (I forgot her name sorry) it was amazing and I really hope they make it a permanent drink on the menu. My sister and I don't drink often so I was a little nervous however the mojito exceeded my expectations. We ordered  the crispy duck bao's as an appetizer it was super crispy but not dry and so flavorful. (Forgot to take a picture)Our entrees were also a hit: I ordered the Cuban fried rice, portion was a good size and I was able to bring home leftovers, so flavorful and the shrimp was not over cooked. My sister ordered the Char sui pork belly and it came with sweet potato purée. So flavorful and the pork belly was tender and not dry. The yuca fries were great super crispy (which I loved) and it came with a spicy ketchup that had a little bit of a subtle kick. Now onto dessert (also forgot to take a picture of just the desserts) my sister ordered the dulce de leche soufflé. The whip cream was fresh and the mango coulis was a perfect pairing with the biscuit and lechera whip (I would order this again). I ordered the refugiato which is a guava & cheese pastry with vanilla ice cream this was also good tasted home made. The staff helped me sing my sister happy birthday. They were attentive our water glasses remained full. I really feel like i need to end my review with this: please make the rose pomegranate mojito a permanent drink on your menu!! I am looking forward to returning and trying everything on the menu"
5971,"Cheap bottomless (27.99 bottomless cocktails!) and great food! I got the French toast and it was amazing! Very very filling, I couldn't finish it but it was so good! The strawberries were fresh and the whipped cream light! Definitely recommend this place for a cheap bottomless with great food :)Our server was also fantastic and gave us some complimentary mint mojito popsicles! They were so refreshing!"
5972,"We had a terrific overall experience at Calle Dao. I came with 3 friends and ordered the hash with unlimited drinks for brunch. The hash was just ok - it had way too many garbanzo beans compared to the other ingredients. The portions for everyone's food was large. The french toast and chicken sandwich both looked really good. The eggs benedict my gf ordered was terrific. The mojitos and peach belinni were spectacular but we didn't love the guava screwdriver or caipirinha. They have 10+ drink options for their boozy brunch though so no need to fret if a couple of the drinks aren't to your liking.The service from Andres really stood out though. He was so attentive - peeking over to see if our drinks were finished and running over to ask if we wanted another. The table next to us had a birthday, for which they got these mojito ice pops. Andres noticed my girlfriend eyeing those and was so nice to give us one on the house as well. Would definately come back again."
5973,"The food was an interesting blend of Chinese and Cuban. I went with other people who got the fried rice and the pork belly. I got the chicken and yellow rice which tasted great with juicy vegetables and rice soaked in the juices of the chicken.I've heard my friends say the yam in the fried rice was not a great pairing for their taste but overall the food is good. For what it is and tastes, however, it was a bit pricey, but the plating and appearance of food were great"
5974,"This was a fun one. I came with a group of 7 for Sunday brunch. We came in right around when the early afternoon rush set in at around 1 pm and the dining room turned more lively within the ensuing 30 minutes (it was a bit dead on our arrival). It was an interesting space with two levels and a Miami Art Deco vibe. We started with a round of drinks. The Mai tai was excellent but the guava screwdriver was a miss. We got a handful of small plates to share and an entree each. Here's a rundown of what I sampled:Yucca fries (3/5)Shrimp wontons (4/5)Cuban spring rolls (4/5)Crispy chicken sandwich with tostones (3/5)The yucca fries were a bit dense and bland, but they came with an unbelievable spicy ketchup that saved them. The shrimp wontons were also very good, but the plate was quite small and I wish there had been a few more wontons. The Cuban spring rolls similarly were awesome with tender lechón and a tangy mustard sauce but the four half spring rolls were not substantial enough. The entree I got was huge though, a very crispy chicken sandwich with tostones in lieu of yucca fries. Unfortunately the chicken was a bit under seasoned and the tostones were also bland. It was a lot of food though.Service was very attentive and pleasant and our time here was enjoyable. Final bill came to $52 per person with tip which was expensive for what it was but probably around the expected range for the neighborhood.Food 3.5/5Service 4/5Ambiance 4/5Value 3/5Overall 3.6/5 (Very Good)"
5975,"Came on a Saturday night with 5 friends. We started at the bar while we waited for our table. We at the back of the first floor and there was an intermittent foul odor that drafted by. We continued with the drinks and the sangria (which was great after a squeeze of lime), margs, and mojitos seemed to be hits. For apps some had the empanadas and wontons with wontons as the clear winners. I shared the ceviche with a friend and the Asian flare was very strong and I prefer a more classic flavor. Everyone loved their entrees. The salmon looked amazing and I tried a bite of my friend's steak that was good. I got the paella and again with a squeeze of lime was perfect. The black rice was very Al dents but it worked. I had the left overs the next day and it was saltier and oilier than I remembered so I think the pairing with the red sangria helped. All in all great spot, good service, not cheap, but appropriately priced and I would return."
5976,"Service, staff, and ambiance are amazing. Justin was a great waiter, quick to check on us and very funny! The food and drinks are great! We tried the wings, raw oysters, lechon on tostones, shrimp dumplings, Cuban fried rice, and black rice seafood paella. We've already made reservations for a group brunch next month. Highly enjoyed and I highly recommend this restaurant!"
5977,"Great Service and Amazing selection of bottomless drinks (you can mix and match! I love the guava screwdriver and peach belini). We made reservations for bottomless brunch- we all ordered the steak and eggs (arguably the best option on the brunch entree so we all go it!). I got my eggs sunny side up. The steak was cooked to perfection (medium rare)!!I will def be back!! This location is 5 stars!!! Lovely ambiance, wonderful service, delicious food, and BOTTOMLESS brunch drinks!"
5978,My friends and I came here for my birthday dinner! We sat outside on a hot day but it wasn't too bad since we were in an air conditioned outdoor unit. We got a variety of items to try/split up including the duck baos and shrimp dumplings (both were excellent and flavorful). For entrees we got the pork belly that came with sweet potato puree And veggies + black rice seafood  paella. Pork belly was the best I've had in awhile...so flavorful! The black rice paella was good but the rice was slightly undercooked? Maybe because it's black ink rice it's cooked Al dente but I felt it was alittle undercooked. For dessert we got the chilled dulce de leches souffle :) omg so creamy and delicious  overall great meal!
5979,"Such flavorful Chinese x Cuban fusion food! Definitely unique and delicious. Came with friends and ordered a bunch of entrees to share and was pleasantly surprised by how great everything tasted. HIGHLY recommend the Mushroom and Broccoli noodle dish. I've never had mushrooms like that before in my life-- so fragrant, tender, and well seasoned. The taste literally shocked me. The Black Rice Seafood Paella was also great and super flavorful! The 5-Spice skirt steak was good but nothing too special. While the food was good, everything was pretty pricey at around $30 per dish but nothing was mind blowingly amazing (except for the mushrooms lol), which is what I would want and expect from paying such prices."
5980,"I used to frequent Calle Dao at Bryant Park location but it has been closed due to a  fire. (Hoping they open up soon)  Came here a few wkends ago for brunch with a girlfriend. Calle Dao Chelsea is just as delish and great vibe. I love the attentiveness of all of their wait staff including the bartender. Impeccable service. My friend had the steak and eggs w a side of yuca fries. I had the chorizo hash and i added steak to it. Yummy, filling and good flavors. We also did the bottomless brunch for $29 for 90 min. We got quite tipsy. You are able to switch up the drinks within the 90 min. We tried the margarita, mojito, bellini and screw driver. Had the opportunity to catch up w a good friend over delish food, good drinks and great vibe."
5981,Very good time and good food! Great ambiance and vibes. Our server Andres was amazing!
5982,"Andres the best of the best Great time, great food. Atmosphere is fun and lively but not in the way where you can't have a convo. Was recommended by a friend, will def be back."
5983,"This was definitely an interesting spot to eat at - it was the first time I had ever heard of Cuban-Chinese fusion! The ma-pro maduros were excellent. However the portion of crispy duck baos wasn't that big. It felt like more of an appetizer than a dinner portion. I feel if they came premade then they would have had them portioned out better. That also would have given them an opportunity to have the duck marinated. Because it came in a ""deconstructed"" style, it ended up a bit flavorless when I put everything together."
5984,"Appetizers, drinks, and dessert are A+. Entrees could be better. Deconstructed duck baos were a little dry, and messy to put together. Chorizo & grabnazo hash was good, but the sweet potato is a little overpowering. Char siu maitake, again, would be better with a little less hoisin sauce. The fried rice was an easy standout - fun, tasty, classic.We were in a group of 4 on a late brunch on Sunday, and they were very kind to let us hang around for a while (place wasn't very busy). Iced Coffee was strong and delicious!"
5985,"I came here with a reservation for lunch on a Sunday and was able to choose between indoor and outdoor dining. My friend and I opted for outdoor dining because we thought it would be cool enough with two portable acs there. It was still really hot though and I don't particularly recommend it for really hot days like today. I was directed to a table right next to another party of two when there were other tables open. I asked if we could sit at a table further down so we could have some distance between us. The waiter looked uncomfortable and informed me that a larger group is coming later so they'd like to combine those tables later. Upon hearing that, I didn't push for it further. However, during my meal I noticed those seats being taken by another party of 2 who came later. Furthermore, when the big party came, they were perfectly good on seats and even had a spare table to use if they needed it. Also, while the place uses a contactless menu (using QR code to view the menu), they did not provide anything else specific to covid (i.e. hand sanitizers or screens between tables). Yet, everyone is required to pay a 8% covid surcharge.Now that I have all the complaints out of the way, the food was absolutely phenomenal. I had their char siu maitake (mushrooms with two sunny side eggs, peppers, onions, and sweet potato puree). I absolutely loved the dish even though I'm typically not a fan of peppers or sweet potatoes. My friend really enjoyed his cuban sandwich as well. All in all, this meal was amazing but everything else that happened made me knock off a star."
5986,"This is an overall good try of combination of cuisines. We came here for bottomless brunch on Sunday. The choice of drink was fine, and the drinks were pretty strong (especially the spirit-based drinks). The Cuban sandwich spring rolls were delicious, particularly with the sweet and sour sauce. The Char Soi Maitake was actually mushroom and not the ""Char Siu"" meat. The mushroom was delicious delicious, but the portion was quite small considering it was vegetarian. The decoration of the restaurant was quite exotic, with a lot of old ads, newspapers and paints from both China and South America in the 19/20th century."
5987,I rarely give a 5 star review for brunch spots and if I do it's because:- They have an amazing brunch food menu- They have an awesome bottomless specialLucky for you this place has both!I booked brunch for a large party of 11 people and we all did the bottomless package. The fact that they had so many quality drink options in this menu makes this a must visit place the next time you have a large gathering. I must of had 5 different drinks over the 90 minute time slot. I also loved the quality of the food and that they had vegetarian options for my friends. I had the chicken sandwich which may look like any ordinary chicken sandwich on the outside but the kick from the fried crust of this chicken made it memorable. Though I will say out of all the items my friends got we were most envious of our friend that got the French Toast. The service was fantastic and very attentive. Will definitely come back when doing brunch in Chelsea!
5988,"Came for brunch on a Sunday with a reservation at 11:45, although they had plenty of seating open when we showed up. We were intrigued by the unique menu options, but the food did not totally live up to our expectations. Ordered the cuban sandwich spring rolls to start which were delicious - would definitely recommend them. However, the entrees were not as much of a hit. While the sauce was a tasty complement to the rice and egg in the Ma Po Maduros, the sweetness of the plantains felt out of place and did not mesh well with the rest of the dish in our opinion. The Char Siu Maitake wasn't bad but it just was not anything special.Service was quick and the bottomless option looks like a fun time, but the food and flavors were not as exciting as we were hoping."
5989,This spot lives up to its reviews the food is fantastic and the service was very friendly ! The drinks were delicious and all of the food had exceptional flavor! I got the duck bao as a main course even though it was an appetizer but it was perfect for me ! I tasted the black rice paella and the beef and broccoli they were both really good ....  I would recommend this spot for sure
5990,"Overpriced and unsanitary.My girlfriend and I visited on saturday and shared the seafood paella, which gave us food poisoning. We are currently bed ridden for the rest of what was supposed to be a relaxing weekend. Food wasn't bad but I can't recommend anyone eat here for their own safety."
5991,"If I could give more stars I would give them 10!We went for brunch on a Saturday afternoon and were greeted with a smiling face and a warm welcoming from the hostess. We got seated right away and immediately attended by the waitron Justin, he was extremely nice good sense of humor and super attentive. We practically ordered the whole appetizer menu minus the mushroom wontons.  I would recommend everyone do the same! The flavor of the food is amazingly delicious and my palate was exploding with so many different well paired flavors. For brunch I had the fried chicken sandwich which was juicy crispy and bouncing with flavor and the yucca fries, I would ask for more of the sauce on the side to dip them in it was so good! We did the bottomless option and you won't be disappointed with this choice because the minute your glass is empty it's filled right back up.  We mentioned having a birthday get together there and right before we got ready to leave the manager came up to us and took our info and the special request to have the upstairs area that is beautifully decorated. If your looking for a spot that has spectacular food, gorgeous ambiance and stellar service def come here. I Will be coming back often!"
5992,"Such a unique restaurant. I would never think to mix Asian and Spanish food together, but this really works. The restaurant has a cute ambience and the drinks are well made. We ordered the salmon and black rice seafood pasta, which were both delicious. I've been here twice now and both times I could not get enough of the food."
5993,"Nice restaurant for Cuban mix cuisine. I loved the crispy duck buns! The seafood ceviche and their oysters were fresh. The chicken with fried yellow rice was a bit dry, but decent. The drinks were great we were a huge group of 15 and had no complains on service. The paella had some chorizo which I really didn't enjoy, but the paella itself was tasty. My friend who's bday it was got a sweet little brownie dessert on the house with a shot. Cool music as well. I'd say a decent place for friends or a big group to just eat some latin food and enjoy!"
5994,"Andres was the best. We came here for boozy brunch and he made sure it was amazing. The food was wonderful, and the portions are big. Drinks were awesome. I recommend the mojito but the Bellini was good as well. The screwdriver was straight up vodka, but go for it if you like. Quick service and we even got comp mojito ice pops!"
5995,"After visiting Favela Cubano, I decided to set up a reservation with Calle Dao to try out their Cuban/Chinese fusion menu and I was not disappointed! We arrived on a weekday so we were immediately seated and decided to eat outside. Our waiter was very friendly & attentive and the experience was seamless.FOOD:STIR-FRY CASHEW CAULIFLOWER- Hoisin, Basil, and Ginger. Delicious & a nice appetizer. A little salty, but the cashews did help balance it out. Would recommend if you're looking for something lighter to snack on while you wait for your meal! 3.5/5. --TOFU STIR-FRY- Chinese Long Beans, Bok Choy, Bell Pepper, Snow Peas, Eggplant, Rice, with Basil-Cilantro Sauce. I enjoyed my meal and found it to be flavorful and packed with a lot of veggies. The sauce had a nice spice to it, which I really enjoyed, and all the flavors meshed very well. The tofu was also cooked well and had a nice texture. 4/5.---5-SPICE SKIRT STEAK- Marinated and grilled with Rice & Beans and Maduro.My boyfriend enjoyed his meal and was really happy with how the steak was cooked. He did say that the beans were slightly bland for his tastebuds but that it was overall pretty good. Since he doesn't eat maduros, I ate them and they were perfectly sweet and soft. 4/5. ---DRINKS:REVOLUCION- Habanero Infused Tequila, Ginger Liqueur, Sweet Corn, Pineapple Juice, Agave, Fresh Lemon Juice and Hibiscus Salt Rim.A nice strong drink that is jammed with flavor and has a nice spice to it! I would highly recommend! 5/5.MARGARITA- We ordered a standard margarita and it was delicious and strong. A great drink to start off the night!----Overall, I am very pleased with my experience at Calle Dao and would certainly visit again whenever I'm in town. Next time, I hope I am able to snag one of their Matcha Tres Leches for dessert!!"
5996,"Very cool concept, but the food was just too salty and oily for me): They didn't skimp out on the seafood in the paella which was nice though!!"
5997,I have been to this very pretty place twice now and have enjoyed it very much each time. They have an excellent happy hour; I enjoyed my oysters and my friend enjoyed her fries. Their salads are excellent as was the wine selection. I love all the pictures of Cuba on the walls.Excellent service...... I look forward to returning.
5998,"Truly one of the best dinners I've had in NYC in three years! The flavors are so unique. You really can't get anything like this anywhere! First off, the service was awesome. Our waiter Andreas was super friendly and our table was never empty but we did not feel rushed at all. We dined indoors on the first night they were able to open and felt super safe with how spaced out it was at limited capacity. Both types of spring rolls are a must and all of the meat falls apart in your mouth. Truly an awesome spot!"
5999,"This place is wonderful! I love the history behind paying homage to Havana's Chinatown. Blending Cuban flavors with Asian flavors provides a vibrant menu,  along with interesting decor and ambiance. My youngest daughter and I always spend a day in NYC before she returns to school in the fall. We have a brunch spot we have been going to for years but this year I decided I wanted to try something else. Tradition broke last year anyway, because we took the year to go NO WHERE because of covid, so I did a bit of research and we ended up here. I am so glad we did. The decor is lovely. Big ceiling fans, bright warm colors, lots of greenery and twinkling lights. It feels transportive. The service was stellar. The staff is helpful, kind and accommodating. Now, the food. So good! We started with the Cuban sandwich spring rolls. This was a perfect way to incorporate the Cubano if you want to order something other than a sandwich for your main. All of the food flavors of the delicious Cubano are packed into a perfectly fried spring roll with lime-infused mustard for dipping. So delicious! My daughter ended up with the burger and I chose the crispy duck with baos. Excellent choices! She contemplated a few things on the menu but the burger that was topped with plantain chips won her over. And it was so good! Cooked to perfection and served with yucca fries. I didn't know if I would find the fries too starchy but I loved them. They were delicately but thoroughly fried and were hearty and flavorful. I thoroughly enjoyed my deconstructed bao order. The crispy duck was definitely perfectly crispy, seasoned wonderfully and was delicious nestled in the bun with scallions, Chinese pickles and hoisin sauce. We didn't skip dessert. We ordered the chilled dulce de Leche soufflé that was creamy, sweet AND tart (because of the mango coulis ) and was  beautifully plated. On our ride home on the bus back, this was the food item that my daughter said she wished she could have a repeat of and could be eating it at that very moment. The brunch includes a bottomless drink option for 30 bucks but it is for a table of appropriately aged adults and traveling for the day to New York with my 15-year-old didn't lend itself to that. But it looked great and was a good deal. I did try a Bloody Mary and a mojito, both delicious and well balanced and loved that the mojito was garnished with a stick of sugar cane. We will take our traditional trip to this city next year but I think our brunch spot will be this spot. It was a special meal."
6000,"Such a great combo! Cuban and Asian apparently mix well. The food was really good, the cocktails as well. Very fun atmosphere, great music, super friendly staff. Favorite dish: Pork Belly!"
6001,"Calle Dao pays homage to the Cuban Chinese scene in Cuba and I'm here for it. The service here is impeccable! I stopped by late on a Sunday night with my boyfriend's family and we didn't feel rushed at all - we were welcomed in with a friendly smile. My favorite things were the ceviche, beef & broccoli, fried rice, and duck baos!"
6002,"I went here for dinner when they first reopened indoor dining. Tables were far apart and it was pretty empty since it was a weekday! I didn't feel unsafe and they have a barcode to scan for the menu. I absolutely loved the oxtail croquettes. I'm such a big fan of oxtail but the real seller was the chutney it came with. The crispy, savory flavor of the croquettes combined with the sweetness of the chutney was a great combination.  I had the black rice seafood paella as my main course, which was delicious. I would totally recommend this dish to anyone who comes here."
6003,Best place to be for drunch!!! Andreas and justin is the best!!!Pls come here for all ur drunches and to have fun!!
6004,"I'm sorry, but this restaurant is so overpriced. First--the good things. The service was solid and the ambience and decor were nice. It was easy to get a reservation for 7 on a Thursday night and there were no issues with being seated.My main gripe is that the prices are way too expensive for what the food is, even considering that it's NYC. I've had much much better meals for half the price. We ordered the Cubano spring rolls to share. The portion was very small for what it was, and the concept was nice and novel but not particularly inspired. It just tasted like a Cubano in a crispy shell. The sauce just seemed to be like mustard. The yucca fries are not as good as the ones I've had at my school cafeteria. They were more hard than crispy, and the texture on the inside wasn't any better. They were not flavorful and were vaguely reminiscent of cardboard. The gochujang ketchup was a nice touch.The ceviche was decent, the Asian flavors paired well with the fish and the wonton was a classic pairing. The fish didn't taste very fresh, though."
6005,andres was the best server! came here for brunch for my friends birthday. we all ordered bottomless drinks which was the BEST idea. you can pick whatever drink you want and switch drinks around as well. i got the papas rellenas and the cuban sandwich. their food was really good! zero complaints on either item. absolutely wonderful for a bottomless brunch place. my only advice would be to sub the green sauce for the yellow sauce.. the yellow sauce didn't have much flavor.
6006,Delicious food and excellent service! A fun atmosphere and a unique menu--definitely great for brunch
6007,"Very nice spot. I love the concept of Cuban Asian fusion. The presentation of the food and the restaurant was very nice.Drinks: I had the Revolution and Max Ver cocktails. Both delicious. I love absinthe so I was very fond of the revolution, the absinthe gave it an amazing aroma and aftertaste.Food: for appetizer, I had the crispy duck bâo. It was a bit too crispy in my opinion. Didn't taste like the type of meat you would get in bâo, usually it's a soft meat, it didn't blend for me. Then for some reason I stuck with crispy dishes and got the crispy pork belly. Same thing here, a bit too crispy for me but that's honestly my fault for ordering to Crispy foods lol. I would recommend the fried rice though. I had a bite of that and it was way better. For dessert I had the crème brûlée soufflé and that was fantastic, two delicious desserts combined into one.Ambience: very beautiful and stylish restaurant. Lovely lights and decoration. Not loud at all. Nice scene for a date or business gathering."
6008,Delicious Cuban Asian fusion food. Hearty apps. Lively atmosphere. Busy bartenders. Comfortable bar seats. Creative cocktails. Delicious beef and broccoli dish with thick noodles.
6009,"Amazing service! Food is great too but the service won my heart. I had never heard or had Cuban-Chinese cuisine before Calle Dao. We came here for brunch in a group of 6. We loved the food and our server so much we stayed for hours past the 60 minute bottomless hour. Our bill came up to $889, tip and tax included, and it was worth the splurge! All the appetizers were great. My favorite was the empanadas with a hint of curry in it! The mapo maduros (plantains with mapo tofu sauce) was a unique food experience, served over rice and a sunny side up. I would recommend coming here for dinner instead of brunch for wider menu selections."
6010,"O.M.G. I know that is not a very sophisticated way to start a review but it is what my friend and I kept saying with every bite and drink we took. Stopped in for one drink and appetizer...after trying said appetizer we decided we wanted to try as many things as possible as it was too delicious. Our bartender, Marvin, (we sat at the bar) was AMAZING and steered us in all the right directions...the Cuban sandwich spring rolls, empanadas, shrimp wontons and duck bao...to name a few. Also...who would have thunk one of the best margaritas I have ever had would be at a Cuban/Chinese fusion restaurant??? 5 stars is not enough to express my love for this place. Can't wait for round two!"
6011,Brunch is hands down the place to be in NY! Grab yourself the bottomless option and get Andres as your sever! Can't say it enough 5/5 GREAT!
6012,"1. Staff and service: Good service, kind, attentive, waters were filled.2. Food taste/ quality: The oxtail croquets ($12) were so good, it came with a creamy sauce base and a mango salsa base which worked so well together. The fried chicken sandwich ($19) was good, was expecting something more, but I enjoyed it.3. Ambiance: We went during brunch hours on a Saturday and the crowd was mostly trendy people in their 20s out for brunch with their so's or friend group. It was a nice crowd.4. Wait time / Reservation: Made reservations, no issues getting seated. We made reservations indoors, but it was nice enough to sit outside and they were able to accommodate."
6013,"Brunch was great. Bottom Les was out of this world, we had the choices of margaritas bloody Mary Mamosa's. We were so lit that we ended up staying for dinner and oysters and chicken wings was amazing"
6014,"My boyfriend and I visited this establishment on Friday expecting a great meal, but were met with food poisoning from the seafood paella. I wish I could say that it was good, but it was not worth being bed ridden for days. I do not recommend eating here for anyone's safety. On top of that, the business manager responded to the wrong person under his review, dismissing our experience."
6015,"Nice seating and atmosphere, and service was good. Interesting fusion concepts, but I'm not sure if the food was all the way there"
6016,"Came here for brunch with a reservation. They have both indoor and outdoor seating available. For brunch, you can add on bottomless drinks for $27.99! Food was amazing. I tried the char sui maitake which was grilled mushrooms with eggs and the crispy duck baos. The duck was cooked perfectly and the flavor with the sauce was amazing! As for drinks, I was surprised to see the Brazilian drink caipirinha on the menu! They had some great options to choose from."
6017,"The food was amazing! We ordered the shrimp wontons as an appetizer and I had the fried rice as a entree. We also did bottomless and overall it was a great experience! Shoutout to our waiter, Andres, absolutely amazing. Very attentive and gave us the recommendations on the wontons and the fried rice. He really made sure the experience was as great as it was! 10/10... would come here again! It's Calle Dao for meeeeee !"
6018,Andrés is the best server I've had in all of NYC! Love Calle Dao even more bc of him. Bottomless drinks was a hit. Food was FIRE! Every time I looked up there was a drink or plate ready to be places. Super attentive. 10 outta 10 recommend here because of Andrés! Thank you for an amazing experience!!!!!!!!!
6019,"What more can I say? This place was fantastic.We went on the first 70 degree day of the year for brunch. We arrived 30 minutes early and was seated immediately. The hostess and staff were very hospitable and accommodating.Calle Dao - Chelsea did a great job with their Covid outdoor seating structure. The inside was beautiful as well. Our waiter, Justin, was very attentive and full of personality. The Cuban Chinese cuisine made for an elevated culinary experience. For our food, we went with the Oxtail Croquettes and Shrimp Empanadas as our appetizers and the Chorizo & Garbanzo Hash as our brunch entree. All of these dishes were delicious, but I must say, if you like spice, you will love the shrimp empanadas. I'd definitely come back to try the rest of their menu and drinks. We didn't get drinks because they were a little pricey, but they have a happy hour from 4p-6p everyday where the cocktails are $9, beers $7 and $2 oysters & clams."
