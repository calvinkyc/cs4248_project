0,I'm a fan of apple products and I like almost everything about this new MBA. But it has one huge flaw that nobody talks about. It's the camera hardware and it hasn't been updated in ages. My zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light. A $1000 laptop with 10 year old front camera is unacceptable. Camera is very important to me. Especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time.
1,"Liked:- Long battery life (one charge WILL last all day, i.e. 16 hours. Personally tested true)- Speed (the new M1 processor really is fast)- Quiet (no fan but the laptop still does not get hot)- Light and portable- High resolution & bright displayDisliked:- As with other MacBooks, the keyboard is mediocre especially compared to laptops like Lenovo Thinkpad- Incompatible applications (With the M1 processor still being new, you might experience existing programs frequently crash. For example, Chrome keeps crashing) But I would guess there will be a fix soon"
2,"UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable.The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long.Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using ""swap memory"" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board.***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB.I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models.There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD.***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly.------I purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12"" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1.The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco.I likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive ""Pro Apps"" running at the same time.I would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.I would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball ""not responding"" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1. If however, you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable, faster and cooler running than the Intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable Mac."
3,"The M1 chip really is amazing. But it only lasted five days for me. Somehow mine managed to break after using a third party USB C hub. The screen wouldn’t turn on at all, and an Apple repair tech couldn’t figure it out after doing a few quick tests. Oh and then Apple said it would take a month to replace it with a new one."
4,"Beautiful laptop. I’ve upgraded from the MacBook Air of old...so far this laptop has blown it away. It wasn’t overly pricey to be honest and I feel it’s worth the price. Overall look is great and keyboard feel is nice. Larger touchpad is great, I’ve paired my Magic Trackpad 2 with it as well."
5,"I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13"" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13"" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.Good:- SCREEN looks great!  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  I usually don't go above 50% brightness.- KEYBOARD is good.  Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard.  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic.  Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great.  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.- LOOKS GREAT.  Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.- NO FAN.  That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.- PERFORMANCE.  It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time.  For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU.  Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27"" (top end) with Intel chips.- TOUCH ID is great still.  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons.  On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA.  Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch).  You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay.  And so on and so forth.- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.NOT GOOD:- WEBCAM still sucks.  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc.  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27"" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera).- ONLY 2 PORTS.  Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort).  Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame.  I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.OVERALL:A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem.  Love it so far!"
6,No complains so far.  Very fast and performs great.  I had a 2014 MacBook Air and finally upgraded this year.  This is leagues beyond that entry and I’m very happy with this upgrade.
7,"Lightweight, blazing fast, easy to use, battery life is incredible with the new Apple M1 chip.  A typical Great Apple product.However, there is only a Thunderbolt port, so you now have to go out and buy a cable to convert USB to thunderbolt (if you want to use a backup hard drive) or other USB items, AND, I had to buy yet another cable to sync my phone's lightning port to the thunderbolt port on the computer. Total $56.I LOVE Apple product, and worked for them in my caerer, but I would wait on buying this version until the software for it has been developed.UPDATE: After several months of using this computer, I have have found several things of concern:1.  my notification center keeps disappearing, despite my constant reinstalling the widgets.2.  my computer's calendar, reminders, and photo stream do not sync with my IOS devices (iPhone & iPad).  If I add an item to calendar on my phone, it will appear on my mac but not vice versa.  Reminders will not sync regardless of which device I originate the item on.I have contacted Apple support on all these issues and they cannot solve the problem.IT APPEARS THAT THE BUGS HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED OUT, YET.  THINGS ARE MADDENINGLY CLUNKY!"

   Bought this laptop bc i needed it for spring semester and i needed an upgrade from my heavy macbook pro. I go to work too so i needed something super light and thin i can just bring everywhere and slide it in my bag.I am obsessed with how fast this macbook is. The battery life is on point. I used it for movies and series at work and it lasted for 3 days. The processor is definitely sooo good. I open so many tabs at once and it has not lagged on me. The keyboard and trackpad is responsive.I love the color. The main reason why i bought this too. 😍😂I have no problems with it at all.Highly recommend"
9,Opened my brand new $1000++ computer and the entire screen was cracked and destroyed. Awesome! Thanks Amazon.
10,"I am writing this review focused primarily on people who are considering jumping from the 13"" MacBook Pro to the 14"" MacBook Pro, which is what I did. I moved from the 13"" MacBook Pro M1 with 16gb of RAM to the 14"" MacBook Pro M1 Pro with 16gb of RAM.Size: So, 1"" of screen might not seem like a lot on its face, but the difference is pretty substantial, in my opinion. Even the pictures don't quite do it justice. The screen feels considerably larger in a package that isn't considerably larger. For me, it's the perfect sweet spot for someone who wants something larger than the 13"" model, but smaller than the 16"". I had a 16"" MacBook Pro i9 and it was just too much for me. This one feels perfect.Form Factor: The new 14"" and 16"" MacBooks both adopt a thicker chassis, which is shown in the pictures. As such, Apple decided to make the casing flat instead of gently rounded. It honestly reminds me of the pre-unibody builds, but still sleek and modern. If I didn't know this one was new and you just laid them side-by-side, I might say that the old form factor looks a little newer, but that isn't to say that it looks bad.Aesthetics: Overall, I touched on the aesthetics a bit in the ""form factor"" section. It looks like a high-end laptop, but at the same time I can see some people thinking it looks dated. I personally like the flatter look over the more rounded look, but it will depend on the person. Another thing I like is moving the ""MacBook Pro"" branding from under the screen to the bottom of the casing. I just think it provides a cleaner look during use. The black background of the keyboard is also a plus for me. The old space gray background was fine, but I really like the black.Function: Most people probably won't notice a massive difference in the previous iteration and the new iteration. For the 14"" and 16"" MacBook Pros, the touchbar has been removed. This will make a lot of people happy. For me, I was always pretty ambivalent about the touchbar, but I'm not going to complain about a key row there. The keyboard appears to have ever so slightly more travel and bounce. It's not a huge amount, but it is noticeable. I'll touch on The Notch later.Performance: My 13"" had the M1 chip and now my 14"" as the M1 Pro. So far, I haven't noticed a tremendous difference when using programs like Logic Pro, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Lightroom, but I wouldn't say those are super intensive programs. If you're exporting massive 8K videos, you might want to jump up to the M1 Max. One thing I have noticed is that the thermals are maybe a little bit worse. Just a touch. I have noticed it warming up a bit, but the fan still has not come on once. I only mention this because my 13"" M1 stayed cold at all times. It's not as bad as my i9, which sounded like a jet engine revving up while it jumped well over 100 degrees, but it's something to be aware of.The Notch: Honestly, so much has been made of the notch and I think it's mostly overstated. Yes, it's fun to meme the fact that Apple still hasn't found a way around the notch, particularly on iPhones, but it's really not a huge deal. Were it up to me, I would have just left a bezel up there, but I can understand why Apple didn't. I use a Dell XPS for work and it has razor thin bezels with no notch, but at the same time the camera is an absolute joke. Looks like it's from 2002.The Notch (cont'd): The notch behavior can be inconsistent from app to app, but not to the point where it's bothersome. I have seen some programs with very large nav menus up top bump the status bar out of the way to make room. And while this particular phenomenon is not something new for MacBooks, losing a big chunk of that bar to the notch will likely make this a more regular occurrence for people. Do I wish it didn't have a notch? Yeah, probably. Does it hurt the experience? Very, very little.Screen: For everyday indoor use, which is almost exclusively what I do, I think you will be hard-pressed to find a better screen on the market. The 120Hz refresh rate is something I waited a long time to get on the iPhone, so I was pretty shocked to see it implemented on the new MacBook Pros just a month later. It actually has more pixels/inch than the iMac 27"" 5K screen, which I also use pretty regularly. All-in-all, the screen is just the best in the business.Overall: It's a great and powerful laptop for someone who is wanting a little more than web surfing and word processing. I use mine primarily for recording music, as well as live performances using standalone plugins, so I need something that is powerful and easy to use. The MacBook Pro has always fit the bill, but now with the M1, M1 Pro, and M1 Max chips, I have absolutely no concern for performance or consistency.My 13"" M1 did just what I needed in this regard, but I'm someone who wanted a slightly larger screen without drastically increasing my footprint and weight. The 14"" MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip is just what I needed. If you're someone who needs absolutely top notch performance, I'd recommend upgrading the RAM and going with the M1 Max."
11,"I haven't upgraded my computer for more than a decade, so it would stand to reason any recent releases would impress me, but this macbook pro has gone above and beyond in the small time I've had it.The screen is truly something to behold. Smooth, clear, just beautiful. I don't typically care about bezels, but I might start. The expanded screen makes an unexpected difference. Meanwhile, I barely notice the notch. Apple said they'd find workarounds to make it scarce, and they have.The speakers are wonderful as well. I was skeptical at first -- thought I caught some tinny effects on a couple songs, but the more I listen to them, the more I'm convinced the tinniness was in the recording (it was a live album, which might explain it). As for the spatial audio, I've only heard a couple songs, but it's pretty trippy. This is my first experience with it, and it doesn't disappoint.In the short time I've had the computer, it's been nothing but fast. Probably more computer than I need, so if you're a sound editor or photographer, this review probably isn't for you. But for those of you casual users who want a solid machine that will last (as I said, my last macbook pro made it more than a decade), this is the one. Excited as I was for my last macbook, I could see room for improvement at the time. Right now, I don't see how things get better than this."
12,"M1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. Compared to previous MacBook Pro, it's a giant leap ahead. These tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the Macbook. This particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro,  but it still kicks butt. You can get the Pro Max chip and bump up the RAM to 64GB if you want - and add tons more storage. The 14 inch MacBook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. It can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. The display is stunning. Just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. The brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. Real HDR viewing -  a big difference. You will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. After 10 minutes I don't even notice it. It means nothing for your experience. Its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. Camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous MacBooks. Six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. Music/movies it feels like surround sound. For video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. The keyboard is a dream to type on. Very solid like all MacBooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. The Apple Magic Keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. Battery life is amazing. I have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. At best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! Especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it won't be 17 hours but I did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. The power efficiency is ground breaking. They have added back the MagSafe power plug - which is great! And added back an SD card slot and and an HDMI port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. I wish it had at least one USB-A old style port - but it doesn't. You get three USB-C thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. They got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro MacBooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. Apparently they listened to a lot of users who didn't really like the touch pad. The shape and style of this laptop is great. Some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. That is BS. I have been typing most of the day and I don't feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. Very comfy for typing. Some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new Macbook Pro, but I am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside -  this is an amazing laptop - the best Apple has ever made, hands down. And I would say you won't find a better power laptop anywhere.  All that said - this is not a gamers machine. Apple is not for hard core gamers. I mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. I am a hard core gamer and a PC geek  - I have a powerful windows PC for gaming. And always will. But for everything else. this MacBook is king. I use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. I can plut into a giant monitor if I want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch IPS panel. So if you are wondering if this Macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - I am here to tell you, its the real deal. I finally upgraded from my 2015 MacBook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. If you are thinking of getting one - you won't be disappointed. One last comment. I am an old timer windows guy, and I know all the counter arguments for the Mac. Many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. First, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new M1 Pro chips - you can't. And aside from that, the Mac OS is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text FROM A PHOTO! Whaaat? And the design/ergonomics/quality of these MacBooks is unmatched. So, yes you pay more - but you get more. My last MacBook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. If you want this laptop - get it! It rocks."
13,"I have a Mabook Pro covered by Apple care. The computer needs a new battery. To make a long story short Apple left me for months with a computer, again under warranty, which I can use for a couple of hours for simple tasks like web browsing before it needs to be recharged. Apple refused to replace the battery because the diagnostic read 81% not below 80 % as per policy. In all this Apple didn’t have any problems asking me to invest countless hours of my time between doing clean installs trips to apple stores etc.. I feel a more respectful way to treat me as a loyal customer could have been let us replace the battery first and if that doesn’t fix the issue which I seriously doubt ask me to do troubleshooting. All this to save something that would probably cost you few $$. Seriously ?"
14,sent me base model
15,"I probably got a faulty laptop but the charger status doesn’t show it’s charging when plugged in, only thing indicating that it’s charging is the orange light. My chrome windows keeps crashing whenever I put the computer to sleep and the external video display rarely connects"
16,"I never write reviews, but feel compelled to write one for this Macbook Pro. I've owned macs consistently since 1990s and have dealt with eye strain on the air and now on this laptop. It gave me horrible headaches and eye strain even with a matte protector. I returned it and am now looking at PCs for the first time because if I can't read from the screen without it making me sick, I can't use it."

   My first MacBook ever! I had been saving up for it before the official drop— & I was not disappointed! Love the Touch ID feature, and it’s so efficient! Can’t wait to use it when I go back to school!"
18,"This laptop has a superior display, superior speakers, superior camera and an excellent keyboard. Don't go cheap and buy the ""affordable"" MacBook Air base model like some of these talking heads have been advising. It's not a good buy if you are unhappy with it after six months, and believe me, you will be unhappy with 8 GB of RAM and two USB ports after six months. M1 MacBooks are not upgradeable so if you find that you need more RAM, you are stuck. Unless all you are doing sending emails, tweets, and watching TicTok, you will probably need something more, especially if you are using your laptop for work. I'm using my MacBook Pro with an LG UltraFine 5K 27 inch display as my desktop system, which replaces a 27 inch iMac. I'm very happy."
19,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Sheeeese! What can I say? Apple has done it again 🤪😍 magnificent piece of device I must say."
20,"This is an unusually large advance over previous models, especially in raw computing power, but also in fun things like screen and headphone support.This Amazon listing has two different processors, the M1 Pro (listed as 16-Core GPU ""style"") and the M1 Max (32-Core GPU). I'll call one the Pro, the other the Max. I got the base Pro, but much of what I'll say applies to both, and I'll have some comments specifically about the Max too. (MBP below = MacBook Pro.)Amazon doesn't offer most of the options you can get, only the ones listed. For now (and probably later), that's the Pro with 16GB RAM and 512GB or 1TB SSD, or the Max with 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD. 3 versions total.Screen Brightness* and HappinessThis screen can get up to 1600 nits brightness and can sustain full-screen brightness up to 1000. That's very impressive, as MBPs since 2016 have topped out at 500.*But the vast majority of the time, this screen will also top out at 500, because those other numbers are only for HDR (high dynamic range, what Apple calls XDR), i.e. some videos and some photos viewed in some programs. If you're browsing the internet, using productivity apps, or the like, those are almost all SDR (standard dynamic range). You'll be seeing them at the same brightness as with MBPs for the last five years.That said, the new screen is beautiful and bright in both HDR and SDR for most situations. For HDR, it puts out more color and brightness, and darker blacks - a million-to-one contrast ratio - with a wider range of light and color that has more pop and more detail in shadows and highlights. It can be dazzling or just more realistic.For SDR, it's much like before, still a gorgeous screen, with better contrast than before because of darker blacks.Has more pixels per inch (254, up from 226), and more pixels all over (3456 by 2234, up from 3072 by 1920). The aspect ratio remains 16:10 (not counting the top menu bar).ProMotionProMotion is Apple's name for screen refresh rates that can go up to 120Hz, or lower to save processor/battery power when 120 isn't needed. This makes motion smoother, more natural.For now where ProMotion applies is limited. Most scrolling in browsing, including with Safari, still tops out at 60Hz. Which is fine for me, but it bothers some people, looks choppy to them. This could be changed with a software update.Bloom and GhostsBloom is when a bright spot on a dark background bleeds out past where it's supposed to be, a common issue with this kind of screen. I and most others think this screen handles it well (better than the iPad Pro), but it can still arise some.Ghosting is when a moving object leaves a noticeable trail of ghost images behind for a fraction of a second, one for each new frame until the old image fades. MBPs are notoriously mediocre at this kind of ghostbusting, and this screen is no exception. Expect the usual haunting, if you notice that kind of thing.PWMFor those concerned (you mostly know who you are), there is PWM (pulse-width modulation) on the smaller 14"" version of this screen, and so very likely on this one too, at a frequency of 14,880Hz at all brightness levels (measured by NotebookCheck). That's a very high frequency, considered well beyond what would cause trouble for the susceptible.The NotchAs you can see in the main photo here, there's a black Notch at the top of the screen. There are no pixels there. The long-desired improved camera is there, and a mic array and light sensor (and maybe room for a Face ID system if they decide to make MBPs with that). As with the iPhone Notch, it's controversial.You can make the Notch disappear, or rather blend in, if you make the background up there black. It also disappears into the black bars when you view things like videos in full-screen mode.The cursor disappears into the Notch if you put it there. If an app has menu items that stretch there, they disappear too, but they'll still function normally if you put the (invisible) cursor on them.Desperate times call for desperate measures. Most apps won't have this trouble, but if you must, you can avoid menu items disappearing by using the ""Scale to fit"" function, which shrinks the entire screen work area a little to fit below the Notch. Makes it look like an old 15"" if the background is black, like there are wide black bezels. (Google ""Scale to fit below built-in camera"" for full instructions and mockery.)There are also third-party apps, such as Bartender, to manage how items appear in the menu bar and keep them visible.Camera and MicsThe new camera that, along with the thinner bezels, makes the Notch necessary, is 1080p, with an f/2 lens for good exposure in the shadows. Video looks noticeably better than before, though it can have a processed look.The three mics sound very clean and natural but with a little less bass than before to my ears, which is fine.Extra ScreensYou can use two external monitors with the Pro, down from four with previous models. They can be up to 6K @60Hz with a billion colors. The Max can still use four: three 6K and one 4K, all @60Hz etc.You can use 4K @120/144Hz HDR monitors too.You can run two from one port if you use the right kind of dock or daisy-chain.Headphone OomphThe new headphone jack has more power for high-impedance headphones. It automatically adjusts, so it won't overwhelm low-impedance phones. If the headphones have less than 150 ohms impedance, they get 1.25 volts RMS. If more, 3 volts. That might cause it to fail to provide enough power to some not-so-high-impedance headphones that still require extra power, such as planars.With my 2016 15"" MBP, I've had to use a portable amp for my Beyerdynamic DT 1990 Pros (250 ohm), but now I can pretty well do without it, though sometimes only just. The volume on some sources is still not always what I wish I could make it. But now I can nearly achieve hearing loss with the intro to the guitar riff in ""Money for Nothing."" Which also sounds good, and healthier, a couple notches down.Among other headphones that have tested favorably with the new jack are the DT 990 Pros (250 ohm), and the Sennheiser HD650, 660S, 6XX, and HD800 (150 to 300 ohm).One report says the planar Hifiman HE4XXs (35 ohm planar) sound good, but most planars tested are said to need more power. The Audeze LCD-2Cs are reported to sound good enough, though not their best. The LCD-3s and Hifiman Sundaras and Aryas are said to be underpowered.For my usual regular-impedance phones, Cleer Flow IIs (16 ohm), the wired volume is a little louder than before, though still not always the earsplitting barrage I want for some sources. Maybe for the best.Quality iems (in-ear monitors) that require especially clean input, but not too much, reportedly sound good, including Andromedas and Moondrop Starfields.SpeakersThey're improved from the already laptop-leading speakers from earlier MBPs, with a fuller sound and decent kick, amazingly good for when nothing with a 3"" woofer is around.Apple mysteriously says the 14"" M1 has the same speaker system, but looking inside both machines shows the speakers in the 16"" are bigger - both ""subs"" and tweeters - and located differently, with the subs in the front corners on this one. The 16"" has fuller bass (such as it is).Heat and NoiseThere isn't any.None with my typical use, at least. If you push it hard, it can get warm, but not as hot as my 2016 15"". Which makes sense, as this has a larger enclosure, bigger fans, larger, better heat sinks, and more power-efficient processors. The fans don't have to spin up as much to do the same amount of cooling, so it's noticeably quieter even when it does heat up, rarely makes any noise at all.The 16"" Max comes with a larger heat sink than the 16"" Pro, so likely runs a little cooler and quieter sometimes, though the Max might get hotter when it uses a lot of that extra power.KeyboardVery quiet, much like the older Mac laptop keyboards, not the butterfly ones from 2015-19, but the rest. Maybe less travel in the keys than some of those, but plenty for me.I miss the touch bar sliders for fine control of some functions, but you can still use sliders via the Control Center, the icon next to the date on the screen's top menu bar. That's also where control of the keyboard backlight is, no more control for it on the keyboard.TouchpadThe best available by far, responsive and large so you can carry the cursor over a large area with more control. For clicks, it's great. For taps, which I turn off, it's not as great, according to those who prefer that - appears to be a software issue.PortsThere's one less Thunderbolt/USB-C port than before, but 50% more bandwidth (3 controllers instead of 2).The HDMI is 2.0, can drive up to 4K HDR @60Hz.The SD card reader is shallow, so the cards stick out. There might be room for a flush micro-SD adapter. I only have cards up to 64GB, which work fine. Some people have had trouble reading some cards, so it may be finicky.Battery LifeI usually keep plugged in, but the reviews I've seen that cover battery life tests typically say it's the longest of any similar machine they've tested, including PCs. Reports of battery life for office work, browsing, watching videos, and so on generally range from 10 to 16 hours, sometimes more. It can go unusually long with heavy use too, 5 hours or more of video work, for example. Max Tech did 10 benchmark and stress tests with it in a couple hours, some maxing out the CPU or GPU for up to ten minutes, and it still had 36% left.At normal settings, there's no performance hit until you get down to 3%; until then you can process or game at full tilt. There's a low-power mode that extends battery life by limiting performance, lowering screen brightness, etc. The Max also has a high-power mode, but it seems to only ramp up the fans sooner to help cooling. Apple's description and tests in reviews indicate it doesn't affect performance in any direct way.The Max has tended to have a little less battery life than the Pro in reviews. The only good tests I've seen that compared directly either found negligible differences or up to 15% less battery life for the Max. (Other tests haven't been well controlled.)You can quick charge to 50% in a half-hour. The new power brick is 45% more powerful than before, and maybe 30% larger lengthwise, still small for what it does. You can charge at lower speed with smaller bricks (not included) via the USB-C ports.Size and WeightIt's noticeably heavier than before, about 5 ounces over the previous 16"", and not quite as sleek, but it's sleeker than I was expecting from the photos.RepairabilityHa ha! But really, it's better than it was. Battery modules now have pull tabs so they can be more easily replaced. The screen can be replaced more easily, but if Apple doesn't do it you lose True Tone (which I don't want anyway). The headphone, Thunderbolt and MagSafe ports can be replaced without replacing the logic board. Now rates a 4/10 from iFixit for repairability, up from 1/10 for the previous model.CompatibilityComes with Rosetta 2, which enables M1 Macs to use programs written for Intel Macs, and usually works very well.There's no more Boot Camp, so to run Windows or Windows programs you have to use third-party software like Parallels, which runs Windows by emulating a Windows machine (and requires a Windows license), or Crossover, which modifies Windows programs to run on Macs.  Which works best, or at all, depends on the program.GamingWoW *mostly* runs 50 to 120fps at high settings and resolution, depending on the location. Some places can't even manage 50 at those settings, though, but do OK at more compromised settings. Baldur's Gate 3, Diablo III, CS:GO and several others can run at 60-100fps or better at good settings.You can play Windows games via Parallels or Crossover. They generally don't run as well, but some do fine.Most games, including native ones, run quite a bit better on the Max, with up to 2x the fps. Final Fantasy XIV is hit and miss at good settings even with the Max.Gaming isn't usually hot or noisy, can get warmer with light fans for the games that aren't running natively. And there's no noticeable performance hit for gaming on battery.WorkI have to mention the less fun part: how well this does things you might have to do at work. It does almost all of it better than before, much of it way better. Here's how it compares according to actual test results from numerous sources with Xcode, Logic Pro, Lightroom, Blender, Final Cut Pro, Premiere Pro, and so on. The range of comparison depends on what the task is.Previous base MBP 16"" (Intel i7 AMD 5300): The Pro is 60% to several times faster.Previous top-spec'd MBP (i9 5600M): The Pro is about the same to 2 or 3 times faster.Regular M1 machines (not M1 Pro or Max): The Pro is about the same to several times faster.The 14"" M1 Pro with same specs: The same, though the 16"" has the bigger battery and heat removal system, so it fares better in those ways.Windows laptop work stations: This is complicated, but the Pro can thrash most Windows laptops in most intensive work-related apps. It lines up very roughly with machines with a good i7/i9 and an RTX 3070, but generally can't keep up with the RTX 3080. The Pro uses a fraction of the power, and so only produces a fraction of the heat and noise, if any. And lasts and performs much better on battery.Pro vs MaxThe Max is about the same to twice as fast as the Pro, mostly between those extremes. The CPU is much the same, but the GPU is double the cores, so the main advantage is in graphics-heavy work.Besides the GPU cores, the Max has twice the bandwidth for memory transfer, two hardware video encode engines instead of one, and some extra cooling capacity.If you're already successfully using a Mac laptop, you don't *need* the Max, since the Pro is already better than what you have. But that doesn't mean you can't benefit from the Max's extra power if you have the money. For intensive video editing, massive photo editing, or better gaming (though cheaper Windows machines will play most games better), the Max has real advantages.To confuse things a little more, Apple (but not Amazon currently) also offers a demi-Max with a 24-core GPU, halfway between the Pro's 16 and the Max's 32. It's a cheaper way to get the extra bandwidth, video encoder, and cooling advantages of the Max. Tests show that in graphics-intensive tasks it operates roughly midway between the Pro and 32-core Max, often more than half, as expected.WarrantiesThis comes with a one-year limited warranty against manufacturing defects that includes free phone support for the first 90 days. If you want to also cover accidental damage (with deductibles) and extend the regular warranty and free tech support to 3 years, you can buy 

AppleCare+ from Amazon

   (link embedded) or Apple. You get 60 days from purchase to buy it, but coverage for accidents doesn't start until you do. (I always self-insure when I can, so I didn't get it.)DecalsLast and least, this comes with two black Apple decals, the sign of true professional Apple equipment."
21,Out of the box unusable for me. This MacBook Pro does not have any USB ports to be able to restore from a previous Mac back up that’s on an external drive. You must buy an adapter. Since I live in a remote area I’d have to order online and wait. You cannot even plug a iPhone12 Pro Max directly into it. The only ports it has are thunderbolt. So even Apple’s own lighting connector needs an adapter. The keyboard is a downgrade from the old keyboard. Solid black plastic instead of plastic keys surrounded by aluminum which were easier to see. Had to call Apple support to download an update because there is no reset option in the System Preferences of OS Monterey. And the update did not work to give it that option. Will have to figure out a different option to remove my account and information to return it. This particular MacBook is defective I believe.
22,I ordered the 2021 16 inch right away as I knew they would probably sell out fast. I had to make sure I had one for my trip I am leaving on soon.  As soon as I opened it the screen would never come on.  Thought maybe it needed charging so I tried that.  Still nothing but a black screen.  It kept making the sound when you open it up even when it was closed over and over again.  I took it to the local Apple Store hoping I could get some answers.  They tired to get it to work and could not either.  They said it is very strange and maybe something happened to it during shipping.  They said since it is brand new it would be best to get my money back from Amazon.  I thought maybe I could just exchange it before my trip but the one I ordered is out of stock.  I will try the 14 inch and see if I like it compared to the size of the 16 inch since it is in stock.  This is a first MacBook Pro I have ever purchased and now I am a bit nervous.
23,"Here are the temperature results for the new cool MacBooks compared to the old overheating intel ones. 91 degrees for the old one near the processor, and 74 degrees on the new ones. Both had been running for hours transferring files nonstop. Amazing. I have been editing video, transferring large files and not once have the fans kicked on. Makes me want to cry."
24,"Finally, this 2021 MacBook Pro cured my depression!"
25,Arrived DOA - wouldn’t start up. Spent hours on the phone with Apple support and still wouldn’t start. Returned - c’mon man!
26,"This laptop is unbelievably fast. Between the screen, battery life, and performance, this laptop is head and shoulders better than any competition."
27,My first ever MacBook. Switched over from PC and I can't believe I didn't switch sooner! On the pricer side but I'm super happy with my purchase!
28,"I have been using my MacBook Pro from 2014 for work until last week when I finally purchased this MacBook Pro. My old MacBook starts up and works as fast as the day I bought it. The only reason I bought a new MacBook was because the battery life was getting low. I probably could have just bought a new battery and it would have been fine.That being said, I did hold out for this MacBook because Apple brought back the ports that I needed. I use the HDMI and SD ports daily. An Ethernet port would have been nice but that’s asking too much. This MacBook has a 2 day battery life and is blazing fast. I use Adobe programs and this MacBook doesn’t even blink when I do live editing. Best laptop I have ever used.I own a business that uses many PC laptops and a couple MacBooks. A PC will never last as long as a MacBook. And, a PC ALWAYS gets slower after 6 months of use. The price is high but you can buy a new PC every 2 years or a MacBook every 7 years."
29,"Coming from a 2019 16in, I feel that this generation is 2 steps forwards, 1 step back.Pros:-Fans are never audible even under full extended load!  This was my #1 issue with my 2019 mac which would have constant fan noise with 2 monitors.-2x battery life-Better screen especially in dark environment or a dark subject-Extremely fast for certain workloads such as video editing and code compilation.-magsafe is back (although I personally don't care for it)-most apps work normally with rosetta emulation, but may have some stutter.Cons:-thicker and SIGNIFICANTLY heavier.-Screen has a notch which is very distracting for me.-Still has some compatibility issues.-Terrible for games.  Only a few titles are supported natively.  I only tested league of legends(uses rosetta emulator), but it was choppy and 1/3 the fps of my 2019 intel macbook.- +$300 base price even though they got rid of intel.-The area I feel apple has made a major misstep is with ports.  I couldn't care less for SD card or HDMI, but everyone who buys this is going to need USB-A.  It's ridiculous that I still have to bring a dongle everywhere just to use my mouse but these ports I never/rarely use are back.Also some developer related tools/libraries aren't working.C# debugger is totally unsupported for example.  Anything that requires gpu hardware acceleration (pytorch) is unlikely to ever be supported in any usable form.  Linux dual boot is unsupported or in early experimental stages.  I also had issues building/running java projects natively, but no issues with rosetta.If you're looking to buy this for an undergrad program, it's probably workable.  However, I'd suggest saving some $ and getting a used mac or windows machine.  Professional devs will be aware of their specific requirements, but I suspect many will need to keep a secondary x86 machine for the foreseeable future."
30,"Was very iffy about buying refurbished but it’s honestly like new! There are a couple of LITTLE scratches but nothing noticeable! Compared to my friends MacBook Air that she paid 1100$ for and they are the absolute same. Best $500 I’ve ever spent. & the company is AWESOME! The charger didn’t work as soon as I got it & I emailed them. Within an hour I had an email from them and they were sending me a new charger, thankful my friend had her charger that I used until I received mine but the battery last like 2-3 days so it wasn’t that bad."
31,"Seller: IT5050Wowie! My son wanted an Apple Computer for Christmas and I was not about to spend $1000+ on a laptop for a 11-year-old boy. But a refurbished MacBook was definitely priced more appropriate for him. This computer is AMAZING people!!! Looks so clean and new. Only a couple faint scratches on the bottom, the keyboard looks like it was hardly touched, screen is clear and no burn marks in it, plus the battery is great. The seller was so awesome to get me this gift in time for Christmas, they are quick to respond to emails and followed up to make sure it was delivered afterward. (seriously, the nicest people!) I had purchased another renewed MacBook from another seller, and their level of quality wasn’t as good, by far. I wish I could pre-select a quality grade for the laptop (excellent, good, fair, etc.), so it is a little scary just leaving it up to the unknown. I work in the retail business and I like to applaud small companies who sell quality products. Do yourself a favor and go here, they gave me a laptop that is stellar and eased my worries about a refurbished laptop. It really looks so good and is operating perfectly. This is such a smarter way to buy a computer, especially for kids, or if you like to have the pricier brands without spending the high price. – Happy Mommy!"
32,"Wow! Bought this from TECHarvard and was claimed to be Certified Refurbished, which according to the Amazon description should show limited to no signs of wear.  Well the device that I received not only was pretty scratched on the bottom, had a huge ding on the corner of the top cover, but the keyboard showed more signs of wear than the MacBook that I've had for 5 years(Space bar was completely warped).  Definitely does not resemble a new device in any way shape or form.  If they are selling used devices, call them used and mark the price down accordingly.  This is definitely going back."
33,"Overall the laptop is nice. A couple of marks on the outside but works relatively well. There was an issue with the battery that originally came with it. It would shut off around 65% battery life. I asked the seller for a replacement battery, which they gave to me free of charge. However, the replacement battery is not originally an Apple battery and instead a knock off. This issue prompted it to restart randomly no matter what the battery life was at. I’m putting the original battery back in and having Apple replace it with the appropriate battery for an additional fee. I got what a paid for and I won’t make the mistake of buying a refurbished Apple product from anywhere other than the Apple store again."
34,This is the BEST purchase I’ve ever made! The laptop 💻 arrived on time and in MINT condition. It functions beautifully and works flawlessly for my personal and business needs. I would recommend this seller to any & all I know who are in the market for reliable and affordable devices.
35,"Battery doesnt work! I travel to another country with the laptop and web I turned on and unplug it, it shuts down! And in Battery Options appears ""Replace now"". How you can help me? I'm in Ecuador now and wont be back in a year!"
36,"I love my new MacBook Air, it came as expected (relatively like new condition). This my first Mac and I’d purchase it again refurbished, you save greatly and get almost the same product 😀"
37,Bought certified refurbished ended up with a unit with a screen covered in dead pixels. I contacted apple to see how much a screen replacement should be more I'm looking a repair cost more than I paid for the laptop.
38,"DO NOT BUY!!! I purchased this computer for about two month and one day I couldn’t turn it on after it goes into sleep mode for a long time. It just wouldn’t turn no matter what I do, I tried every single method out there. I had to press the power button a hundred times for it to finally turn on. But after a while even that won’t work. The computer is just dead. I had to take it to the computer store and they told me it costs $434 to fix it!!!! Even though I actually paid to get it fixed I recommend everyone do not buy!! It’s not worth the money and will cost you more!! The guy in the computer store told me that there is corrosion inside the motherboard and in order to fix it it costs a lot of money ($434). I am truly upset and wished I would have just bought a brand new one from apple that’s the newest version and which will cost me less than what I spent on this computer!!"
39,"The laptop worked great the first week. Eventually, things started to decline and quickly.  I would constantly have to change the time clock, and that would prevent many apps from working properly or not at all. I also discovered that my webcam did not work. I asked customer service if I could get a replacement laptop, and they gave me a website to help me fix it myself. It did not work. Also, the computer would start dying very quickly, even after a full charge. I would also not start up automatically, even with the charger plugged in. I had to press to start button almost endlessly for it to just power on. Eventually, it just would not cut on at all, even with the charger plugged in. It’s completely dead. Apple says that it should cut on with the charger plugged in if it were a battery issue, so it’s definitely something wrong with it beyond that and it will cost upwards of $400 to fix. I’m totally bummed. It did not even last a year."
40,"I pulled the trigger on this thing hoping that the bad reviews were wrong.. some of the comments saying it came dirty and defective definitely gave me pause however, what arrived today was practically a brand new macbook. the device does not show any signs of wear and the battery cycle count is 18, it came with the original power brick and while the cable was used, it was not worn or dirty in any way. While i've only just started using the device about an hour ago, I can tell you that it's speedy and works flawlessly... had I not known it was a refurb when buying it, I would have easily confused it for a brand new mbp.. for those asking, this is a 2017 macbook pro and the specs as quoted are accurate. i'll play around with this thing for a little while and update this review as needed, but so far this looks like a winner!***update***A few months in and it’s still working flawlessly. I don’t regret my purchase for one second, and neither should you!"
41,This is not a 256GB MacBook Pro- they are falsely advertising it as such and then shipping buyers 128GB versions.
42,"Came in used and dirty, and it was not even turn off, I'm gonna return it. So disappointed."
43,"Wow. I cant say enough how happy I am with this laptop! I it arrived early, and for a refurbished computer I swear it doesn't have a scratch, dent, smudge or single flaw anywhere on it! Its fast, the battery is great, its working perfectly! I couldn't be happier with this thing!"
44,"Was excited to receive it and on the outside it had one noticable chip in the case on the cover side (which had a sharp edge to it), but thought that isn't too bad.  But when opening it up the screen in both the top left and top right were broken/chipped/cracked like it had been dropped and they replaced the cover, but not the screen.  This was not acceptable.  Wanted to try it out and ended up learning that some of the keys did not work right (sticky, pushed strange and such), plus the touchpad/mouse was really strange and didn't seem to work correctly.  Too many issues out of the box for me and too concerned that there might be other issues from where it looked to have been dropped and such.  Sending it back and just started that process.  So far the return seems ok....but just hate that the product does not match the description...using their words ""Renewed products work and look like new""."
45,"I ordered the space gray with 256 gb of ram and received a silver with 128gb.  I knew this could happen as the picture did not match the description and I had seen other similar reviews.The good news is it was on time and in flawless condition.  I think I will stick with it and not press my luck, as it is still a fair price and a great machine, but beware."
46,"I have to admit, I don't typically write reviews and I was a little hesistant about the product due to some 1 to two star reviews. The space gray model not only is at a great price, it came to me brand new. With all the specs I was expecting, i5 8GB RAM 256GB SSD, and works like a dream. Battery life is great, setting up was easy, and all my Apple Products (iPhone, Apple watch, Earpods) synced with no issues. I'm not sure as to why there were so many negative reviews, but mine is not one of them. SO HAPPY!! I truly recommend."
47,the battery is dead
48,"This product arrived quickly and looked great.  There have been multiple glitches with the power switch and with the screen ever since it's arrival.  Most of the time the power button would require multiple attempts to push before the computer would power up.  When the computer woke from sleep state (opening lid after its been closed for at least fifteen minutes) the screen would be black and then all pixelated.  Most recently, the computer wouldn't even turn on, when it finally did, it was all reset and all the settings were reset.  I lost everything I had put on the computer over the past day.  The seller still hasn't gotten back to me after email and I left a voice message.  I have now initiated a return as I want my money back.  It would have been nice if they had gotten back to me ASAP when I emailed or when I called (during normal hours of operation, by the way) and it went to voicemail.  The fact that they didn't and the computer kept coming up with other issues.  I now will buy a new one.  The value is not there with the aggravation generated."
49,"Multiple reviews mentioned getting devices with used batteries, screen issues, etc.My laptop arrived through FedEx Express with questionable packaging. But everything was intact and fine. The laptop still had the plastic wrapped around it as MacBooks directly from Apple do, even with the screen cover. Only 3 battery cycles out of the box, with a new charger in the box. I am very satisfied with the purchase although in the Q&A section of this product someone mentions that this is a 2018 model, its not, its a 2017 (At least the one I received.) which for me isn't really a big deal since it arrived in exceptional condition. Highly recommend this MacBook."
50,"Delivered to me within 12 hours of purchase... Sealed in original apple packaging with protective film, blemish free, not a scratch.. Mint.its powerful, Ive already loaded some big task audio software and broadcast software on it and its flying through the multiple processes together at ease... (Logic 10.5 / Traktor DJ 3.0 / OBS)Super light and portable, If this is a MacBook Pro then I can't even imagine how light the Air models are. Nor could I even imagine why you may need something more powerful. I am having to adjust to the new keyboard and Touch Bar, I keep hitting Siri and volume settings, even as I type this.id also recommend getting a keyboard cover as well.... I hear these keyboards go out sometimes and to repair it. This is no fault to the reseller, but I can't believe Apple with their price points don't offer a bigger SSD for the lowest price point.... 128gb is laughable so be prepared to buy an external SSD along with a Thunderbolt 3 / USB-C Hub to run hdmi, and various external accessories.Overall I love this computer so far, it was a nail biter as I rarely ever shell out $1,000 on anything but I'm very pleased and satisfied with my purchase. And I still cannot find a better deal on the internet, not even used on Facebook marketplace, letgo or craigslist....Five stars"
51,So not worth it. All they want to do is take your money do NOT BUY THIS ONE! Its used and if you search apple on amazon they have brand new with higher stats for cheaper.
52,"Just received this, but so far so good. It looks BRAND NEW. There are literally NO signs of cosmetic wear or damage. It arrived in a sealed apple box. I’m finishing setting up and I already love it. For just under $1,200 for a 2019 model, this is a GREAT deal!"
53,"I really love my MacBook. I really love this laptop. I'm a huge MacBook fan and this works like new. So far I don't have a problem with the butterfly keyboard, but I heard bad reviews about the keyboard from watching YouTube videos. I think that they may have fixed the keyboard problem when they refurbished the product??? I'm not sure, but honestly this a really great laptop for a really great price. I do wish that it came in the original Apple box and packaging, but it wasn't far from the really deal."
54,"It looks and feels brand spanking new! Definitely happy with my purchase considering that I bought a brand new 2020 MacBook Air and hated it. Returned it back in 2 days. I paid a lot less for the Pro than the Air and its A LOT better with so many features. I’m not trying to persuade anyone out of getting the Air but if you are considering on buying a MacBook my advice would be to just go ahead and get the pro. The Air reminds me of a google chrome book slapped with an Apple logo on it. Not saying that google chrome books are bad, but there’s no need to pay a full band for the Air when you could find something similar and a lot cheaper. All in all I really love this laptop."
55,"Bought this laptop with some apprehensions, as i have typically bought refurbished goods from apple directly. This was my first from amazon, and i was not disappointed. The notebook was flawless, not a single scratch on it. second, all the accessories where flawless as well, not signs of usage. When i powered on the notebook to verify usage, the battery had cycled only 3 times, meaning it was still in new condition. Very highly recommended seller. Thanks for a pleasant transaction."
56,"This laptop looked new, straight from Apple store."
57,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   The screen arrived damaged, what a scam.!"
58,"Although I was very skeptical about purchasing a ""refurbished"" MacPro, after reading the reviews for this company, I made the purchase.  The MacPro arrived earlier than expected, expertly wrapped, included Apple certified, and in NEW condition.  There is no way I could tell it was not new or refurbished.  The price was the best I could find after researching other sellers.  I would highly recommend iPower Resale Inc to anyone looking for a MacPro.  Their customer service is exceptional.  Thank you for a great product!  5*****"
59,"When I looked at this product it only had one review and it was a bad one... I then checked all the other products the seller sold and the reviews were excellent, needless to say I took a chance and ordered this MacBook Pro 2019. It arrived before anticipated and it was securely package. I AM SO GLAD I took a chance on them because this MacBook is amazing! Now I’ve waited a couple months before reviewing it to make sure it works. The MacBook looks brand new, it didn’t have any dents or scratches. It works and performs like a new MacBook. I had to contact the seller over the a small issue with the charger and they went above and beyond to correct the issue.Excellent customer service excellent product. I recommend this seller to anyone!"
60,I'm very dissatisfied with this purchase.I can't use the Mac because the hard drive was not reset and the software on the Mac dose not allow you to use it.Also there was no charger.Again very disappointed.
61,"Looks brand new, wrapped and sealed in Apple packaging. Plugged it in and turned it on and let it go. Absolutely no problems, it was automatic and wonderful to have the computer set itself up. Has performed flawlessly as expected of an Apple laptop."
62,"The laptop arrived in fair condition.  The screws show signs of wear so it may have been opened up during the ""renewal"" process.  Old stickers were left on the bottom. Also, the laptop was shipped with a cheap knockoff Chinese charger.  I have no reason to trust this charger so I'll have to order a genuine Apple one instead.Fortunately I don't need this machine to be a workhorse or I would send it back.  This should survive a year at least but I don't trust it as-is - I will wipe the hard disk, NVRAM, and SMC just to be safe."
63,Product was faulty. The charging port wouldn't hold the plug. I returned it. I don't think the refurbishing process is very competent.
64,"This is exactly like the MacBook I was given for work that was stolen on a plane flight. No problems with this as a replacement so far, smooth sailing for 3 months already! I got the protection plan just in case, but I'm very satisfied with this cheaper than new replacement. Will update if there are any issues that arise. Would recommend."
65,"Idk what I was thinking not having an apple in the first place. This laptop is very easy to use, fast, and I’m excited to see how productive I can be with this format. I feel free, nothing holding me back now!! Unlike old pc with unresponsive interface, slow speeds, and constant crashes, this one gives me no problems!!"
66,This laptop was literally like brand new out of the box. So far my daughter is so thrilled with her graduation gift. She is ready for college now!!!
67,"Our first ever Mac but so far its been quite impressive. It was easy to setup and get it going. It works well and very easy to use, turn on/off, carry around and day to day life. Wish the battery would last a bit longer."
68,"BUYER BEWARE!I knew by choosing a refurbished computer, I was taking a risk, but I never expected this. When I received this MacBook Air, I was surprised it was the model Apple stopped making in 2017, since the title said “Newest Version.” I emailed the seller and they said Amazon forced that in the title and told me I could return it. I work full time, am in grad school, and have three kids. I figured with it being an Apple it would last long enough to get me through school, so I kept it. Now, six months later the screen won’t turn on. It’s completely black.I am able to connect to an external monitor and use the computer that way, so I know it’s the display. After trying to adjust the brightness, several resets, resetting the SMC and the PRAM, I called Apple Support. They ruled out all software issues and told me it had to be the hardware.At this point I contacted the seller and they basically told me “sorry, it’s outside of the 90 day window so there’s nothing we will do for you.” I have escalated to Amazon trying to get some kind of resolution. They just confirmed there is nothing they are willing to do for me. They also are not doing anything to penalize the seller, All Out Apple. I'm shocked at Amazon. Shady sellers like All Out Apple will always be around, but I really thought Amazon was better than Ebay in that way. Lesson Learned.There is no reason a MacBook Air should have a display of a completely stops functioning after six months of use, even refurbished. I’m grateful that I had a work-provided monitor I can plug into to do my schoolwork, but if I was aiming to be tethered to my desk, I would have bought a Mac Mini."
69,"Got the computer two days early! this was probably the fastest delivery I've ever received from amazon. I wasn't going to buy refurbished but I really wanted another MacBook and shelling out $2k for a new one was simply out of the question. When I saw the price for this MacBook Air, I decided to roll the dice and buy it. I knew it could possibly come not as advertised, such as having scratches or not being updated as far as software is concerned but when I opened it up it was practically BRAND NEW! set up was simple as can be! only took me 5 minutes to sign in with my Apple ID and all my information was synced between my iPhone and iPad and onto the MacBook Air. There were a few minor scratches less than a couple centimeters on the bottom of the computer nothing that noticeable. the charger doesn't stick as well as I'd like and one of the hinges is half broken off but I've that same issue with practically every MacBook I've ever had. I was really surprised with the quality. it said 2017 version but with all the updates and new iterations its hard to gauge which MacBook your getting I thought I was purchasing a much older MacBook Air than what I got this thing is amazing and the 13 in screen is far larger than I expected it to be feels like a 15 or 17 in display when having it in your hands/ the computer itself is incredibly light, the main reason I chose the air you can carry it in anywhere with one hand and hardly feel it definitely much lighter than my 2020 iPad 11"" All in all if you're on a budget, this computer is the way to go! for $400 its practically brand new and runs like a dream! thanks amazon for this incredible refurbished Mac! love it !"
70,Exceeded my expectations! Some of the reviews had me a bit nervous but I can’t tell you how happy I am! The laptop is on almost brand new condition! Only 1 TINY nick on the front (you can’t see it unless your looking) and it was perfectly ready for me to set up my account! No issues or problems! It comes in a box perfectly protected and has the charger to go with as well👍🏼 So happy with it! Thank you!
71,"I was so excited because this laptop came in perfect condition. But when I tried to change the unsername to my name it wouldn’t work. 3 calls to Apple later, and I find out this computer is owned by a school that can remotely access my laptop at any time. Meaning, if they wanted to they could shut down and erase my laptop. Amazon gave me a full refund but I am very sad and disappointed"
72,"All in all, the laptop works great! It runs fast, it’s clean, and it’s perfect for what I needed it. The one disappointment I have it they claimed this product as a catagory A which means like new. When it arrived, the screen had two scratch marks on it that was discolored from the rest of the screen. I would understand like new for any other part to have a scratch, but the screen is a big deal and it should have mentioned that in the details."
73,"This MacBook Air is amazing!  I had been previously using a 2007 MacBook Air and it was time to upgrade.  I have never purchased refurbished before so I really didn't know what to expect, though was greatly concerned.  Needless to say that this laptop heavily exceeded my expectations.  Other reviewers stated that their MacBook was not as described, though mine looks brand new.  The keys are still crisp and clean, the screen immaculate.  There are a few light scratches on the outside of the computer (mostly the underside), but it is very minimal and unnoticeable.It runs like a dream, though I have only begun using it.  I will update should the computer have any issues.  It is an early 2015 with 4 GB RAM and its OS is Sierra.  I wanted to share that, as I found the Q&A to be a little confusing on that point and other reviews didn't really mention it."
74,"When I received this package, I was thrilled...until I tried to turn it on and got a “low battery” notification...for 16+ hours. Turns out the cord provided (not a Mac product) is not the correct wattage to charge this device. It’s hard to tell at this point if the computer is faulty or not now that I’ve purchased a new cord from Best Buy, but it shuts down as soon as it’s disconnected from power. The screen is pretty floppy, too- falls back without provocation. All of which seem like things that should have been mentioned in the details before I decided to purchase.After taking this computer to the Apple store, I was informed that the issue was indeed the battery- completely bad and had to be replaced. Again, something that I wish I had known before purchasing. It is in working order now, but doesn’t meet my standards of what “certified refurbished” means, and product details lacking for sufficient purchasing knowledge ahead of time."
75,"It said I had to do an update. When I hit the only update allowed it said the latest version was already installed but it wouldn’t let me go foward.  Also the screen seemed loose.  So if it was cleared out they never installed the new software correctly. So it wouldn’t let me even get to the main screen.  Others had luck but I did not.Also when I plugged the power bar in. It had a bit of a shock come out. As an electrician, I know that was a big no no.  I was willing to spend the money and get the correct power cord. But with everything else. I thought that’s already 3 strikes. No thanks."
76,I was very hesitant buying a used MacBook from Amazon but it turned out great! Looks new and works amazingly. You will receive exactly what was described. I have no complaints!
77,"Good quality, arrived early. As-new condition. Easy to install from my old machine via time machine backup. The old one was a 2010, now we are good for another 5-7 years.Thanks"
78,I have been struggling with this product since day one. I am not getting responses from the seller OR the extended warranty repair company.I have never had trouble with Amazon before. Every issue I have ever had has been settled with ease and courtesy.This has not. Made more devastating as it it is the largest purchase I have had and the product has been unusable almost since day one. We sent it to the extended warranty place who said they fixed it but it still doesn’t work.We have spent hours at Apple doing diagnostics and it is simply not functional. To repair it would cost more than I paid. They do not think that the parts it was refurbished with are even Apple parts.This was a terrible product and not worth the money.
79,"I bought this Mac and it came with a non Apple charger, I bought this as travel computer, sure enough in the first week while I was in Europe I had to buy am authentic Apple charger at $117. Now a month  later my Mac has died. It was having issues as in when I tried to maximize the scene with Netflix it would just shrink to a 3x5"" screen volume,  also the screen had been replaced before I bought it and is not well attached, very disappointed, I bought this last summer, but only started to use it in October when I was traveling, so I spent close to $700 for a Mac that lasted 2 months, return and replacement window has ""closed"" so I am stuck with a hefty repair bill."
80,"BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY MOTHER, SHE IS 70 YEARS OLD AND BARELY USES THE LAPTOP.THE SCREEN IS IN THIS STATE, APPEARS TO BE PEELING! VERY BAD!!"

   Note: My purchase was completed through Kanga Supply for this item that ultimately doesn't function as intended.Amazon Renewed item descriptions indicate that the products should work and look like new, which wasn’t the case for this purchase, ergo my poor rating. After only having the Macbook for less than a day, I was forced to reach out to the seller because the product no longer functioned as intended.CONSThe Macbook worked fine for the first hour or so of use, but during an update, the screen flickered vigorously (see video). I hoped it was just a fluke, and it led me to believe there may be some software or hardware-related issue. After having the Macbook for less than 12 hours, I was forced to reach out to the seller because the screen flickering caused the laptop to become unusable (see picture). I also came here to draft a review in hopes that my issue is resolved quickly and effectively. I'll update my review once this is complete.PROSAfter removing the laptop and inspecting the outside, I was pleased. The outside of the Macbook is in good condition, just one or two visible scratches or marks.The charger was not the original Apple charger (as other reviews have indicated) but an OEM adapter. I don’t care that much about whether it’s an Apple charger, as long as it functions.Specs match the advertised item I purchased:128GB SSD8GB ramEDIT/UPDATE: After reaching out to the seller as instructed with the Amazon Renewed products, I never got a response in the allotted timeframe (2 business days) and was forced to reach out to Amazon directly. Ultimately, this item was returned for a refund.UPDATE 2: Today is 1/13/2020 and I have still yet to see this problem resolved to my satisfaction (refund or exchange of working product), after having ordered this product on 12/26/2019. Highly disappointed both in Amazon and the third-party seller.UPDATE 3: Received a replacement Macbook on 1/15/2020. So far it seems to be working, no issues with the screen per the previous item received (was NOT the same item sent back, verified by serial number). Pleased so far with this item."
82,"The 2015 Macbook Pro is still, in my opinion, the best Macbook even in 2019.  I use the SD card reader all the time and have several USB 3.0 devices.  I also use a newer 2017 quad-core i7 for work (no choice) but the difference in speed is not worth the added money and lacking ports.  When I actually put the newer 2017 to work, the heat issue is still a challenge for Apple and performance drops.  It's like having power that I can't actually use unless I sit in a walk-in freezer. Don't quote benchmark speed tests to me, what counts is actual performance sitting at my desk for hours at a time working on a project. I also prefer the magsafe power (although this one uses the magsafe II which I like less than magsafe I which had a more solid connection) This one, I purchased for my wife and it handles everything she needs it to do. Although you can't upgrade the memory on these models, so make sure you get enough for what you need.  If you want to change out memory, then the best choice is the Mid 2012 non-retina model which also come with DVD drives and has USB 3.0 ports."
83,"First off, I am removing a star because they shipped a counterfeit 60W Magsafe 2 charger with my order. I contacted them immediately and they offered to accept a return of everything. I explained that the charger was my only complaint and they overnight FedEx'd a genuine Apple replacement for free.""we sent you the wrong adapter for this batch of order and will overnight you the correct genuine one.""So they knowingly ship counterfeit chargers with some of their orders?The computer is pretty good cosmetically and operationally, but not as great as other reviewers. It is an Early-2015 12,1 model, this one was built in 12/2016. There is a crease over the right USB port from somebody yanking a USB plug. The battery has 107 cycles (89% life left). Keyboard and display are in great shape with no flaws. The SSD has no dead cells. It came with MacOS 10.13 installed.Overall its a good laptop and decent refurbishment job.EDIT: Knocking off another star. They sent me another counterfeit charger. Apple would never loosely jumble the cord in the box, a genuine power supply doesn't stay powered on for several seconds after it's unplugged from the main or stay lit green/orange after its unplugged from the laptop and this fake only puts out 25 watts max."
84,"I really feel like I got a great deal on this, mine arrived in brand new condition and it looked like it had never been used. I did see some people had bad experiences but mine was well worth the price tag. The only negative was that the charger provided is third party and not OEM Apple. The box is also generic and not Apple, not a big deal but you just don't get that same feeling opening it up as a new product. I will say that I checked the serial number on Apple and the computer itself was only a couple of years old, so in reality I paid around $450 for an Apple that was only a couple of years old with a decent amount of battery life still left. I only bought this as there was certain tasks that I could not do on my iPad and so I did not need a brand new super powerful computer. This one is great, does not get hot, fans are silent and the display looks incredible.Overall I was very happy with the purchase, it came fast and was like new condition at the fraction of the cost of a new one. I actually waited a few months before writing this review so that I could also include that I have had no issues at all in that time, battery lasts a decent amount of time and no software or hardware issues to report. It also runs the latest OS that I updated it to and I believe it will be supported software wise for some time to come. Completely worth the price!"

   The Macbook came in working condition with all original components and an OEM charger but not with the extension cord. The major downfall is the condition of the laptop, for the above average asking price for this model I expected great condition as it is stated to be like new but instead the model I received was in okay condition (not cleaned either, large collection of gunk in hinge vent) at best with a lot of edge scratches and deep cuts throughout the chassis, and some unremovable stains from stickers! And worst of all the battery was at over 500 cylces, the battery life was 4-5 hrs max! thats horrible for whats suppose to be a renewed device! Not satisfied!EDIT:  Avoid this entire listing especially from the seller ''Easymobiledevices'', they ship dirty grade b laptop and have poor costumer service."
86,Once i started running it all sort of problems arises. First major problem is wifi drops off and will not let you connect to wifi. After this happens you cant even turn on/off the wifi. Used guest and still no wifi. Restarting or shutdown and restart will not activate wifi. If you restart it takes so long to reboot. Sometimes it get stuck on the waiting wheel on startup. One out of ten restart wifi will work for a minute but then drops off and you will no longer be able to connect again. I cant say anything physically because it looks fine. Lastly beware it shows and says freshly installed mojave os but it has instead sierra installed. The power cord looks like an imitation and not the original one because from the weight it is not the original one. I can tell because i have multiple macbook at home and that is not the original one. I am pretty disappointed with this seller.
87,"I’ll update 15 days from today.CONS:-Delivery packaging: it was a regular box with one thick bubble wrap to protect the laptop.First glance, the charger seems pretty beat up but seems to work fine.-The outer top of the laptop has a lot of scuff marks and scratches. Sides do as well. Nothing TOO severe.-Bottom have some scratches and wearing on the rubber, not too noticeable.PROS:-Had a full battery-Set up went smoothly with no hiccups.-Outer signature glowing Apple works well.-Opening the laptop, the screen has no visible scratches, cracks, or scuffs at all.-Keyboard has no loose keys and is glowing well.-Trackpad has no scratches and works really well no weird working sides SO FAR.-Software automatically updated to Catalina, kinda wanna wait to update to Big Sur.I’ll update March 13, 2021"
88,"Still a GREAT LAPTOP, arguably the best MacBook Pro 13” ever made, 2 or 3 iterations later! I have had mine for 3 months now and although I was a little disappointed that I got a no-brand MagSafe power brick instead of an Apple brand, it’s caused no problems for me. I have been using Logic Pro X a lot and it runs nice and smooth even with the haphazard way I use it, leaving muted unused tracks all over the place as I learn about things like track bouncing and experiment with every single effect and different audio formats (I feel bad sometimes like I am unnecessarily abusing the laptop, lol) and I haven’t frozen or crashed at all. I have used a few emulation programs for old Saturn, Super Famicom, PS and Dreemcast games that push the 2D sprite and parallax scrolling envelope and again I haven’t had any problems. Only thing I have experienced that has been an issue is the actual Mac OS and it’s limitations with regard to formats, programs that it supports and connectivity with outside developers but I have also been able to get around that by setting Virtual Machines up and GUID partitioning to use whatever other OS I need. This is also not a complaint about the hardware itself but rather the Mac OS software so should not be considered when it comes to the actual MacBook Pro 13”.You will want to upgrade to an NVME M2 SSD at least 256 GB or 512 GB right away, as the 128 GB SSD will fill up within 2-3 months of moderate use and the newer M2s will increase the OS loading speed more than anything else. Luckily you have your pick of great SSDs like the Samsung 970 Evo, etc that you can easily swap in with a $5 adapter, a screwdriver and no soldering (just search YouTube for “MB Pro 13 2015 SSD upgrade”)…The unique things and PROS about this MB Pro 13” are the older style KEYBOARD that doesn’t break like 2016-later model keyboards do, 2 USB 3 ports, an SD CARD R/W and a FULL SIZE HDMI PORT all built in. This is the last MB Pro 13 with any of those ports on board and the fact that you can swap SSD hard drives with no soldering and very little skill needed, all-in with the M2 you get a sexy little powerhouse for half the price of the newer model Pro 13”s (1/4 price of current gen)! The rest (CPU, onboard graphics, sound/speakers) make this laptop a must have that will likely only appreciate in value $$$!Two Thunderbolt 2/miniDisplayPorts are useful if you want to setup 2-3 Screens, but the CONS Are that you get NO ThunderBolt 3/USB-C ports and more and more adapters and devices require that connection these days, though with the USB 3 ports there are ways around it, complicated as they may be. You also CANNOT UPGRADE RAM unless you know how to de-solder the current ram and solder up new ram (accepts up to 16GB DDR-3 in 2X8GB formation) and setup the machine to accept the new ram, which seems a recipe to completely destroy the board/laptop without at least some Mac building & Mac hardware programming know-how, possibly even special equipment.MAKE SURE YOU GET THE MODEL WITH THE AMOUNT OF RAM YOU NEED BUILT IN & a CPU that will be sufficient for you and you won’t be disappointed with this awesome little 6 year old laptop! Don’t get the 4 GB model even if it will “work” for you “short-term”! I got the 8GB/i5 2.9Ghz/128GB and I already regret not paying another $100 for the 16GB ram model, but c’est la vie.Just buy this MacBook Pro 13” while you can, replace the SSD as soon as possible, enjoy it, keep it another 5-10 years and you will likely be able to triple your investment by reselling it assuming Apple stays on their current trajectory with their MB Pro Hardware releases!!!"
89,"Hi, I bought this Macbook Pro 13"" early 2015 and received last week on Aug 23th. The laptop has a good appearance and doesn't have any flaws. However, the charger(45w) packed together with the macbook is not for macbook pro but for  Macbook Air. I just found out today, cuz when I use the charger(45w) laptop cpu temperatures goes up to 65-85 celcius. and I can't use more than 4 hours. But when I charge my macbook with Macsafe 1 (85w, which is for Pro), the cpu temperature keeps 40-50 degree, and it runs around 10hours. I want to change my charger into “MacBook Pro Charger 85w”. Thank you."
90,This is by far the best laptop ive ever owned! The laptop came with 0 scratches and only 16 battery charges on it. It even came with the apple box and stickers! Highly reccomend for the price. $850 is great for a 2019 macbook air.
91,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Everything I expected and more! Just like brand new!"
92,I love this laptop so so much. I think everyone should get it. The model is between 2018-2020 and the one I got had the Touch ID on it! Everything was very easy to set up and is in such great quality!
93,"Received in a timely manner.  Will review in a couple weeks.Well, it's been over 2 weeks since receiving my MacBook Air and I have to admit that it has proven to be worth it's price. The Retina display is phenomenal and it's compact chassis is just what I was looking for. I am not a power user, so I didn't need major memory capacity. The speakers are, surprisingly, crisp and clear for such a slim build. The fingerprint scanner is quick and a huge convenience. I am (or was) a long-time PC user and resisted getting an Apple, but the transition was smooth and Apple's claim to fame for being user-friendly and intuitive proved true. If you are looking for a compact, yet capable laptop with QWERTY keyboard, I would recommend this product."
94,"After having the laptop a few months, I can say my leap of faith to buy an amazon refurbished was worth it BUT I had to work a little bit.  It didn't arrive perfect and it still isn't perfect.  There is a tiny white dot on the screen where some pixels died (I guess) and when I first got it, I had to call Apple support to get iMessage and Facetime to work on it.  Then I had to take it to the Apple store to get the keyboard fixed as some keys would not work.  Thankfully, I had Apple Care on it so the cost to get it shipped off and fixed wasn't bad.  Overall, I am happy with my purchase and I recommend this seller, but I will probably buy new next time."
95,"** I have only had the laptop for a week, this review is only based off of the time I have had it**I was so nervous to buy a refurbished computer but this came like it was brand new. New packaging, new charger, spotless laptop. I was worried the battery would be bad and wouldn’t hold a charge. I was wrong. I downloaded over 12,000 photos and was on it nonstop for over 2 days without even having to charge it. I am in love with this!!!"
96,"As in the description exactly, thank the seller for the fast shipping and good packaging"
97,I love this laptop and I’m really happy with all the features. Would definitely recommend.
98,Exactly as expected. Great value.
99,"The product made a loud buzzing/grinding airplane-type noise as soon as it finished setting up which was truly deafening. I presume it was the fan producing this aggravating sound. No programs were running and the room was approximately 68 degrees Fahrenheit so overheating should not have been an issue. Since no computer should ever sound like a coffee maker at any time, I must conclude that it was defective. Return to sender."
100,"Arrived, boxed well with balloon cushions. Power adapter looked clean but had scratches. Opened up the Lid of the MacBookPro and it looked like it had some sort of disease or cancer & it smelled quite strange too. It had over 50% battery so I carried on with a reset which resulted in an error. Luckily it booted back into Yosemite OS that it had installed years ago, after 3 failed attempts managed to update to Mojave. Of course first things first copy music etc onto, USB stick struggled to go in either of the USB Ports (look at the photos) was also stuck after insertion but managed to pull out, with a hard pull - full force - anger. Had a look into the ports and discovered they were literally rusted dirty like disgusting, this is not the definition of Refurbished - but 2nd Hand or Heavily Used. Be aware, set your expectations right in oder to avoid any disappointments."
101,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I was super stoked upon arrival, began setting up the laptop and within minutes the screen stopped working. Literally pixels. Severely disappointed. I have gotten ahold of kanga and they are working to replace the device but it has now been over a week since I’ve purchased the unit with two day shipping and still have nothing to show for it. I hope they come through on their end and send me a functional unit."
102,"I've only had it for about a week now and this 2015 MacBook Pro is working phenomenally! I was kinda hesitant buying a refurbished MacBook from Amazon, but I can honestly say I'm go glad I went ahead and did. It came extremely fast and right from opening the box, it was as if I had bought a brand new one right from Apple themselves. There's not a scratch, dent, stain, dust or anything on it. So far it's working extremely well and I will definitely buy form this seller in the future and recommend them to others as well! Great price for a great computer."
103,"I’ve had this MacBook Pro going on 4 days and so far so good! It has met all my expectations and more. I grew up using windows PCs. This is my first Apple computer and I’m happy to have made the transition. Wish I did this long time ago but better late then never. If it wasn’t for the packaging and not being in the original box, I probably wouldn’t be able to tell this was refurbished. This is just based from my experience using MacBooks at the Apple store. Also, there was a few minor scratches on the bottom of the laptop.I will revise and change review in a month if any problems. But as of now, my review above is how I feel."
104,"I've only had it for a couple days, but so far this is a great purchase. The thing looks brand new, and I know it isn't. I am replacing an older Mac and just can't afford the prices of new machines from Apple. Using Migration Assistant (an app that comes with Macs) I was able to restore a time machine backup from the old machine, so I've lost nothing in the transition."
105,"When I ordered this product for the first time, it came with a green line on the screen. I contacted the costumer service, they responded very quickly and replaced it.The second computer came with better specs, I was the happiest person... for 2 months though, the computer suddenly stop responding.Other things that are worth saying:- The charger is generic. A generic charger can easily damage the battery of the computer, that could explain my problem.- The second computer they sent, had a sticker that covered the whole low part of the computer (those stickers that are the same color as the computer and are used to cover up very big scratches.Conclusion: they can deliver a great costumer service, but not a working product."
106,"The macbook pro only worked for a short while. It had a charging/powering problem - wouldn't keep a charge at first, then wouldn't power on even when plugged in. Confirmed it was not a charger issue.I contacted the company who said to send it back for repair. Once they received it they wrote saying it cannot be fixed and charged me a ""restocking fee"" in the amount of the purchase of the laptop. Outrageous!! I even had a protection plan for it. After numerous interactions they refused to help and returned the laptop without telling me. THEN they said they couldn't do anything in terms of a refund because I had the machine. Months later they refuse to resolve it and amazon can't help me because it's a third party seller. An ABSOLUTE JOKE of a company. I'm out over $500.00 with a computer that can't be fixed - and Apple store said they could try but for more than the computer's worth. So yeah. They have my money and I have nothing.DO NOT BUY from these people if you'd like to keep your money."
107,"Hey all! So I’ve gotten into photography lately and needed a upgrade from my old 2012 MacBook Pro and 2011 Asus laptops for editing. Figured a 2015 model would be the way to go for a decent upgrade without spending tons of money. I was super skeptical about buying a reconditioned one through Amazon after reading the reviews and thought about it for about 4 hours before I made the transaction. Next day it was at my door step with me a bit nervous about opening the package and seeing a beat up MacBook, I opened the box and the MacBook was in a bubble wrapped sleeve and that’s it. Okay I’m fine with that but what was the condition of it? Looks like it barely got used or the previous owner always had a case on it. Outside from a few nicks here and there it’s flawless. Turns on and is super quick, the Retina display is beautiful and definitely enjoyable to watch movies. It came with Mojave so the first thing I did was update it to Big Sur and it’s still flawless. I’ve only had it for a day if that but so far I’m happy with my purchase. Just be mindful yours may or may not be like mine condition wise I got lucky. Should you buy one of these? I would I’m pleased with my purchase and I’m sure you would be too. But I’ll update with any issues if they come up in the future. Thankfully I’m a bit tech savvy so whatever happens I’m sure I can fix it."
108,"This of course this is an old model and reconditioned/renewed, so I was expecting it to look somewhat used; however, this MacBook Pro is in PERFECT CONDITION as if I had purchased it new. I'm upgrading from a very heavy and slow 2009 white MacBook that's a dinosaur and I could only do very basic things on it. It has almost zero capability in terms of battery life (it could only be used plugged in) so this laptop is an absolute gem in comparison. This might be why I'm so hyped and elated. Plus the price was very good. *I hope the computer doesn't have some sudden glitch and dies on me...lol!Now, I can finally edit my videos in iMovie, which was not working on the old MacBook, because I couldn't update it anymore. I need this laptop mainly for traveling, to do editing work, I have a 2 monitor PC set-up at home. My only wish is that I could transfer my Adobe CS to the new laptop.SIDE NOTE: it's actually overall a little smaller than my old 13"" (screen size is the same), it's not as heavy, but not as light as the Air; it arrived with Catalina iOS installed and I had to upgrade to Monterey to use the newest version of iMovie - this isn't a complaint, just an observation."
109,"I bought for my mom, great deal (sort-of), works great (after I deleted 2 mysterious old unknown wifi connections)I bought this for my mom, she was always having Windows problems, viruses disguised as virus removal, scammy pop-ups, and so on.  Happy day!  :DThey raised prices during Prime Day, wth?  I thought I was getting a good deal, but afterward I noticed the price went down.  Anyway, I ordered this for my mom.  She's been using Windows and I wanted her to experience a Macbook Pro.  This one is actually even better than mine!  I'm still happily using a Late 2013 2.4 Ghz 8 RAM 256 GB 13-inch Retina, her's is exactly the same except it's a Early 2015 and it's actually got 2.7 Ghz!  Anyway she seems really happy with it.  I set it up for her, and ran the serial number, which was not found, not surprisingly although I'm not sure what that means, and the update page in the App Store looks like it was coded in 1995, so I'm not sure what's up with that.  Could be something funky going on, but all I know is it works and we're happy with it.  She's getting used to using it, and she says it's fast and smooth.  She was getting tired of all the Windows updates and virus stuff and all the spammy popups telling her to purchase a virus disguised as virus removal, yadda yadda yadda, so I am well-pleased that she is now almost a full-blown Mac-head.  Thanks Apple.  I hope to be able to afford an Apple car when they do come out, haha.  I'm not sure about the battery-life yet, but I HAD TO replace the battery on mine, so replacing it on hers should not be a problem."
110,"Do not waste your money or your time and energy. Please! I felt like everyone else who gave this a chance. I was nervous buying a refurbished computer, but this site had pretty good reviews overall. I was definitely wrong. The laptop shipped quick, but as soon as I pulled it out of the box- it wouldn’t turn on. I tried everything, eventually the following day I brought it to the Apple store to just make sure it wasn’t something as easy as the charger not working. NOPE! That’s when they were able to tell me the laptop had this weird covering on the bottom of it- which covered all the computers info. Turns out, it came from a school. They said it was definitely sketchy and had a hardware issue. I sent it back- it’s taken almost 2 weeks since I sent it out to get my refund- they issued it today, but it still says it would take 3-5 days to get in my account. What a freaking headache and waste!!"
111,"I was expecting a computer with scratches and obvious wear, but there were only two scuffs on the side of the computer which are barely noticeable and well-hidden with a plastic hard-case protector. The computer is rather small and light-weight.The battery life is pretty good for this kind of computer, but that’s just coming from a college student who only uses it to write essays and browse the internet. I don’t use it for more professional tasks like video-editing . Someone previously said the screen is yellowish but that wasn’t the case for me. All in all, it’s a really good, functional computer for the price. I’ll change my review if I encounter problems.Edit: (Nov 2021) I've had this computer for two years now and it's still functioning great."
112,"Arrived with no battery life. Charged with enclosed charger but battery wouldn’t hold a charge. Battery when clicked on, said “replace immediately”.  Had to return."
113,"Received in January and waited a few months before reviewing to have a real evaluation. Quality has been great, battery life is good and speed is good as well. Nice product for the price"
114,"I ordered this Mac Book Air, and reading from the description, I was thinking it would be wonderful. It was a good price, and I'm very familiar with Mac Books. I ordered this sometime in July, and it has worked perfectly. I decorated the outside with some of my favorite stickers, and I had all my information on there. It was my favorite thing I bought.""Oh, well why did you give it one star?"" you're probably wondering. Well friend, you see, this product came without 2 essential parts on the backside of the keyboard. When December came, my keyboard stopped responding to the computer completely. I called Apple about the issue, and what they told me over phone did not work. I had to visit Apple in person, so they could look at it. I was there for hours, and nothing got solved. So I then visited a Professional Computer-Repairman, and when he took apart the backside of the keyboard, he saw nothing wrong, until he looked deeper. He found that I was missing 2 essential parts to my laptop. He tried ordering these parts from China, but they have not responded.I have tried contacting Amazon many times, and they're not willing to help me out since my computer was purchased months ago, so it passed the 90 day rule. I feel as though this special situation should grant me a refund. But nope. Next time I order a laptop I will go to a Repair shop, have them take it apart, and see if anything is wrong. If there is, at least I can send it back within 90 days :).Ohhhh wait, I can't order a new laptop! I'm a poor college student and only had enough money for a laptop when I originally bought this one. And it was a complete dud! Can't wait to spend the rest of my college days in a computer lab. I don't think I'll ever buy from Amazon again. I'm sorry."
115,"I was nervous about buying a refurbished Mac after reading so many negative reviews, but I'm glad I did!  This is a great computer, updated with the latest OS and from early 2015.  For me, this is great for what I need it for.  I purchased the additional warranty just incase.  So far, I'm happy with my purchase!  My best advice is to read the seller's feedback page before buying."
116,I just needed a computer to finish my online schooling and this computer has worked great! No complaints at all!
117,"Works great, I love my refurbished Mackbook Air. I like recycling computers because we are creating enough trash in the world."
118,I got three my two boys and my ex love their MacBook Air.
119,"My old dell laptop had just broken and I was skeptical about buying this laptop but it came packaged nice, charger looks new and no scratches or bends on the corners! It was an easy set up. I just plugged it in and charger works great. I am in college and thought this laptop would be perfect and so far i am not disappointed! Will update if anything happens!UPDATE ONE YEAR LATER:Hey everyone!! My laptop is still running great. I use it everyday for college and my business and I even play Sims on Origin lol. The only downside to this laptop would be the battery, it does not drain too fast but I would always keep your charger around! Other than that I still love it and do not regret making this purchase!"
120,It’s just one continuous problem after the other with this computer. It’s really not worth it to save a little bit of money just buy new not refurbished have your warrantee you’re better off in the long run.
121,For this being my first ever Mac- This was an amazing buy... no scratches or dents. Its basically BRAND NEW. 😝😝😝The only thing is that it says 512gb but the space says 256gb so be wary of that.But other than that I am really happy with my purchase.
122,Good
123,Love it
124,"the product arrived with the screen broken. I would like a refund of $ 400 to repair it, since he is now in Brazil."
125,So happy with this purchase. Even my kids said it looks like the new ones. Has some minor imperfections but at the cost totally acceptable. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.
126,"This is actually the second refurbished Apple product ive bought, but the first refurbished one off Amazon.  Let me say.... a used, 5 year old model seems iffy, but looking at the brand new models I was sold on a refurbished one.I got this solely for the purpose of school.  Im in paramedic school and needed a computer, I have an iphone and ipad (refurbished) and decided to stick with the apple theme. Upon opening it the mac is in pretty good condition, the top looks new, screen is crisp and clear, speakers work great, keyboard has zero issues.  The battery charges to 100% and holds its charge well.  The only cosmetic ""damage"" is on the bottom of the mac which is absolutely ok with me, and its just minor scuffing.Ive had this thing 2 weeks now, and watching constant videos on the human anatomy, constantly doing/turning assignments in online, zoom class meetings, apple music lol and ive had no issues whatsoever.  I do have until Oct to return if desired, which if it keeps up like it is I wont be returning it.  Like other have said, if you want a mac but dont want to pay 1500+ for a new one, this is one great alternative!**UPDATE 02/21** Fast forward to February and this laptop is still going strong!! I use this for school as well as work and personal time.  Absolutely no regrets here."
127,This computer worked great for 4 months until one day it stopped charging. Tried to contact the seller to see if there was anything he can do. But he didn’t even bother to answer. Long story short I paid $225 to have it fixed. Now is working great again.
128,Record your unboxing from very beginning to end and pack very well when sending back
129,This is a surprisingly good MacBook for the dollars spent. This product came in pristine condition and could not be more what I needed. Personally even know it is not the newest model I LOVE the fact it not only has regular USB ports but also has an HDMI port so I can easily play thru my television. The keyboard also actually clicks which I prefer over the new style. The one thing I would say is that the battery life is not gonna last you what the a newer one would (Although that goes without saying). Overall I would highly recommend this laptop if your looking to own a MacBook but do not have the money to dish out for a brand new one.
130,The listing mentions a fresh install of IOS Mojave.  I currently has High Sierra.
131,"Let’s sum things up quickly. It is the early 2015 model that has been upgraded along with the latest OS. It has two thunderbolt 2 connections, 2 usb connections, 1 HDMI and magnetic charger. It’s non touch screen retina 13” and it is bright and beautiful. It’s not as clear as my iPhone 12pro max but it looks dang good still in comparison. I was pretty shocked at how fast the little guy is even though it’s an older model. I am VERY happy with my purchase. It did come with a small cosmetic blemish which was a crack in the Apple but I really don’t think it’s worth a return. The Apple as well as the keyboard illuminates which is awesome I’ve always liked the glowing Apple and never understood why they went away from it.I used FaceTime as well as texted and placedPhone calls directly from the laptop. Shared files and accounts. All works flawless. Does not have all the Big Bang hardware that most know cause the price to go up anyways so I’d rather shop and find what I want and buy them maybe on discount and only the programs I want. *achhoofinalcutproahhh*The laptop does not have an Ethernet cord but as you can see I have run tests on fast.com and gotten up to 1200 mbps/ 1.2gbps Uh yeah amazingI also am able to run my Virtual PC service and have windows as well. Shadow PC (I have blackened out any personal information on screen) does not seem to be any issues. I have yet to run my VR on it next but if trend indicates anything it won’t be an issue through Shadow.I also have a usb Ethernet cord adapter I can plug in a Ethernet cord for a hardline solutionPrinter installed fine. Games ran fine…. Overall just happy I was able to jump into the Mac world for under $300. For me it’s worth it and you remember this is not the end of the line YOU CAN ALEAYS upgrade part by part as you go along if you want bigger and better hardware.I forgot to advise there is also a SD Card slot as well. It’s probably not a coincidence there are good reviews on these products. If you are looking to dive in then you know about the 2015 models and their praised as the BEST laptop still to this day from Apple in some debates.Anyways I was like you reading reviews for hours… watching videos…. Adding items to my cart then taking them out then back again. Yeah I feel for you but honestly if you are here just get it try it out and see how you like it. If not return it… if you are like me I been on it since I got it and it’s been awesome integration with my other Apple products!!Oh yeah I have ran my PSNOW with full Dual Sense controller functionality yesssssss. Steam runs fine… Xbox controller runs fine. Very easy to pair things with the Bluetooth and network as well as airdrop and interchangeable functions between Apple products. I could go on and on so I’ll stop hereThis gets a amazing 4/5PS if you are being nosey and reading the screen with an error message. This was unrelated as this was an option I attempted from the beta options. Once I I clicked the option Shadow ran with no errors on screen. Happy hunting I hope this helps."
132,Absolutely love this Mac but Cosmetically there is a dent on top and also one on the bottom that doesn’t effect the quality of the product but just the looks so I’m satisfied but wish Amazon would’ve stated that and I would not have bought it!… Update I’ve chosen to return it and buy new
133,"I was a little skeptical about purchasing a refurbished computer online. I did a lot of research before purchasing. I bought this computer to start my online business. I read a lot of reviews and found this was the one. I first bought a Mac Air but soon after I cancelled and bought the MacPro. I received it on Feb 7 as it said it would arrive. I was so excited and yet nervous. I videod every thing, From opening the box to checking every inch of it. I was stunned. It was more then I expected and then some. To my surprise the article mentioned Elcapitan but it was upgraded to Big Sur. I was shocked. Not only did this computer come with a protective cover it was in mint condition. when I took off the cover and did a full inspection It blew me away. Couple days later the program allowed me to upgrade to Mac Monterey which I did so far  I am so happy with my purchase and It’s a beauty. With this price you can’t go wrong. Ofcourse with anything that you purchase online it’s  the chance you take and the way I see it you won’t know unless you give a try. I’ll give an update in a month or two. If you are looking for a computer that wont hurt your pocket then  I recommend you  should give refurbished items a try. It’s a better way to recycle used items and keep Mother Earth a healthier place to live..I say just GO FOR IT!!.. you can always return it if your not satisfied.."
134,I received the computer and it made the worst clicking noise any time it tried to process a substantial amount of data. Like playing movies on Netflix or playing a game online. Giving them a 3 ⭐️ Solely because the return process was so easy and I got a full refund.
135,"Very happy with this purchase, I'm typing this review on it.  It's completely clean, like brand-new clean. I'm very picky and I can't find anything wrong with it- no dents, no scratches, no noises, no dirt, nothing that would stop me from buying this again. Smooth lid, crisp keys- what else can I say? Runs like new. Comes in a plain box (double boxed) and it was well packed in an air bag. Also comes with a new aftermarket charger, which is fine. This is replacing the exact same laptop that needs a new screen, so for less than the replacement screen would cost I have a new computer and an extra charger!"
136,"Everything was great until yesterday when thr Mac just decided to quit working all of a sudden. I do not recommend this product whatsoever. Buy from an Apple certified and reputable seller.Update. Took the Mac to Apple. These idiots clearly have no idea what they’re doing according to the Apple professionals. They told me verbatim that “there’s no way the components fried like this on their own, whoever refurbished this clearly doesn’t know what they’re doing and I will make a note of this in the system so the refurbished can’t claim it was your fault”."
137,"I bought this computer and it came very damaged, broken and scratched. The seller never answered to be responsible for the problem. I have to keep this product and spend more money to repair it. I would never buy it again. HORRIBLE"
138,"I've never been a Mac fan, and I never would have bought this, but my daughter's school ""highly recommended"" a Mac, implying that a Windows PC or Chromebook would be inadequate.  Not willing to spend $1200 on a laptop for a 13 year old, I bought this refurbished unit at $575.  Still more than a brand new PC or top of the line Chromebook.  Now, less than 6 months after buying, but well past the 90 day warranty, it won't charge.  The repair is likely to cost more than a typical  Chromebook or adequate PC, and as it turns out, either one of those would be just fine at my daughter's school.  Never again!"
139,"When I got my Apple MacAir, it worked as expected. I run a online business, very basic things on the computer. They have a 90 day warranty on this product but my problems started happening a month and a half after the warranty ended. First, my built in sound went out. I called Apple and they trouble shooter everything over the phone. Nothing worked. I ended up getting a Bluetooth speaker which worked so I dealt with the problem. My computer started to run run slow weeks after, the system thought it was over heating and in the same breathe, the system stopped holding charge. Once I plugged out the laptop, my system died!!!I finally went to Apple store about another month and change later because it unbareable to do anything on the system. They ran a test and my computer failed all test that were ran. They said that this shouldn’t have happened on the timeline that I had the computer.Long story short, I informed this 3rd party seller and they didn’t attempt to help at all because of their policy of 90 days. I was better off spending a few dollars more and going through Amazon products sold by Amazon, which the warranty is 365 days (1 yr warranty).I contacted Amazon again who have been so helpful and understanding of the situation but is very limited, I don’t have a back up computer at the moment and operating my business on my phone temporarily still waiting for assistance thru this 3rd party. I don’t stand behind their quality of product at this point and did not offer a replacement, like they knew their refurbished products wouldn’t last. Not cool! 3 thumbs down!#👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿"
140,"The computer came well packaged in a non-descript box (not an original apple box, but that’s fine with me). The computer is in excellent condition, no nicks, no scraps, the corners are beautiful. The keyboard works perfectly. The laptop was ready to set up with all of my stuff! I’m excited it’s here and it’s workinf great. It is only the first day, I’ll update if anything changes. But I don’t expect it to!"
141,Factory Refurbished Mac. Arrived in Apple box had all accessories with it. Slow processor (Intel I5) but otherwise a great laptop for the price.
142,"Condition of pc wasn't as good as I expected, very dirty, tons of scratches, dont buy them!"
143,The laptop shuts down randomly even though power is still more than 50 %. I got in touch with seller and they said they were willing to offer replacement or partial refund. With COVID 19 pandemic i needed a good laptop to apply for online work apparently I asked the seller if I return the laptop how long will it take before a new replacement will be sent and I asked how much is the partial refund in case because I might just have it fixed here just so which ever way is the fastest. After 2 emails NO RESPONSE to my questions! Now am using the laptop but it has to be plugged all the time just to avoid random shut down. I hope buyers out there this will serve as a warning to all of you. Specially money doesn’t come by easy specially now a days.
144,"The certified refurbished macbook I purchased did not meet the description listed of ""little to no signs of wear""The laptop had a chipped bottom left corner where it appears to have been dropped at one point. On the side with the charging port there is a dent on both on the screen portion and keyboard portion where it seems something was closed in the laptop, creating the dents. On the back of the laptop there is a dent, once again on the side nearest the charging port. It seems like the device may have been dropped on something that would have caused the impression. On the right side of the screen portion there appears to be an indentation/ scratch down the side spacing approximately 1.5 inches. Seller agreed to allow return though so that was appreciated"
145,Very disappointed The product description says it was re-manufactured which means it supposed to be looked at and anything that was wrong fixed or at least most obvious things.  Guess it’s like a car you buy a used car and when you get it it breaks down. But this case I get the computer and it has no ability to be used with the battery it has to be plugged in all the time.  I took it in to see how much it would cost to fix in turkey because that’s where I took it I never thought of turning it on before hand and removing the cord to see if it worked I just assumed it was remanufactured and everything was working properly. So now I’m stuck spending $160 extra to get it working. They did offer me 30 bucks but that was before I actually had it Diagnosed
146,In the listing is say is SSD I GOT AN HD VERSIONoverall the laptop is locking nice but it has a big problem with overheating I open chrome I have 120-degree Celsius and it`s shutting down I will return as fast as possible
147,This is the second time that I have purchased this item . Great value.
148,"I was a little apprehensive about ordering from this seller, because it wasn't Apple certified. But the laptop arrived in mint condition, everything as described and was packed really well. I am very pleased with the seller and the Macbook Air.The ONLY drawback (I can't call it a negative), was that the laptop had High Sierra OS instead of the latest Mojave OS, but it is a free download and corrected in a matter of minutes.The laptop came with over 75% charge remaining and 317 charging cycles (out of about 1000)."
149,It's o.k
150,"I got this for my 13 year old. It arrived in a professional package, looks like new, and works like new. She is psyched. I highly recommend it."
151,USB port does not work with some of our cords for some reason.
152,"Renewed- you think it is a recent model.  No, 2015.  Old operating system.  Overpriced for old system, renewed or not."
153,They sent me a macbook which completed its 925 battery cycles a good macbook only lasts for 1000 cycles thats means I have only couple months left to use. they say they have inspection cycle bla bla as known amazon trys to knows false promises and sell their products
154,Product is light weight  thin and works well
155,There are no present cons or dislikes with this Mac Book. It was perfect for use in completion of my college courses.
156,"This is an unusually large advance over previous models, especially in raw computing power, but also in fun things like screen and headphone support.This Amazon listing has two different processors, the M1 Pro (listed as 16-Core GPU ""style"") and the M1 Max (32-Core GPU). I'll call one the Pro, the other the Max. I got the base Pro, but much of what I'll say applies to both, and I'll have some comments specifically about the Max too. (MBP below = MacBook Pro.)Amazon doesn't offer most of the options you can get, only the ones listed. For now (and probably later), that's the Pro with 16GB RAM and 512GB or 1TB SSD, or the Max with 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD. 3 versions total.Screen Brightness* and HappinessThis screen can get up to 1600 nits brightness and can sustain full-screen brightness up to 1000. That's very impressive, as MBPs since 2016 have topped out at 500.*But the vast majority of the time, this screen will also top out at 500, because those other numbers are only for HDR (high dynamic range, what Apple calls XDR), i.e. some videos and some photos viewed in some programs. If you're browsing the internet, using productivity apps, or the like, those are almost all SDR (standard dynamic range). You'll be seeing them at the same brightness as with MBPs for the last five years.That said, the new screen is beautiful and bright in both HDR and SDR for most situations. For HDR, it puts out more color and brightness, and darker blacks - a million-to-one contrast ratio - with a wider range of light and color that has more pop and more detail in shadows and highlights. It can be dazzling or just more realistic.For SDR, it's much like before, still a gorgeous screen, with better contrast than before because of darker blacks.Has more pixels per inch (254, up from 226), and more pixels all over (3456 by 2234, up from 3072 by 1920). The aspect ratio remains 16:10 (not counting the top menu bar).ProMotionProMotion is Apple's name for screen refresh rates that can go up to 120Hz, or lower to save processor/battery power when 120 isn't needed. This makes motion smoother, more natural.For now where ProMotion applies is limited. Most scrolling in browsing, including with Safari, still tops out at 60Hz. Which is fine for me, but it bothers some people, looks choppy to them. This could be changed with a software update.Bloom and GhostsBloom is when a bright spot on a dark background bleeds out past where it's supposed to be, a common issue with this kind of screen. I and most others think this screen handles it well (better than the iPad Pro), but it can still arise some.Ghosting is when a moving object leaves a noticeable trail of ghost images behind for a fraction of a second, one for each new frame until the old image fades. MBPs are notoriously mediocre at this kind of ghostbusting, and this screen is no exception. Expect the usual haunting, if you notice that kind of thing.PWMFor those concerned (you mostly know who you are), there is PWM (pulse-width modulation) on the smaller 14"" version of this screen, and so very likely on this one too, at a frequency of 14,880Hz at all brightness levels (measured by NotebookCheck). That's a very high frequency, considered well beyond what would cause trouble for the susceptible.The NotchAs you can see in the main photo here, there's a black Notch at the top of the screen. There are no pixels there. The long-desired improved camera is there, and a mic array and light sensor (and maybe room for a Face ID system if they decide to make MBPs with that). As with the iPhone Notch, it's controversial.You can make the Notch disappear, or rather blend in, if you make the background up there black. It also disappears into the black bars when you view things like videos in full-screen mode.The cursor disappears into the Notch if you put it there. If an app has menu items that stretch there, they disappear too, but they'll still function normally if you put the (invisible) cursor on them.Desperate times call for desperate measures. Most apps won't have this trouble, but if you must, you can avoid menu items disappearing by using the ""Scale to fit"" function, which shrinks the entire screen work area a little to fit below the Notch. Makes it look like an old 15"" if the background is black, like there are wide black bezels. (Google ""Scale to fit below built-in camera"" for full instructions and mockery.)There are also third-party apps, such as Bartender, to manage how items appear in the menu bar and keep them visible.Camera and MicsThe new camera that, along with the thinner bezels, makes the Notch necessary, is 1080p, with an f/2 lens for good exposure in the shadows. Video looks noticeably better than before, though it can have a processed look.The three mics sound very clean and natural but with a little less bass than before to my ears, which is fine.Extra ScreensYou can use two external monitors with the Pro, down from four with previous models. They can be up to 6K @60Hz with a billion colors. The Max can still use four: three 6K and one 4K, all @60Hz etc.You can use 4K @120/144Hz HDR monitors too.You can run two from one port if you use the right kind of dock or daisy-chain.Headphone OomphThe new headphone jack has more power for high-impedance headphones. It automatically adjusts, so it won't overwhelm low-impedance phones. If the headphones have less than 150 ohms impedance, they get 1.25 volts RMS. If more, 3 volts. That might cause it to fail to provide enough power to some not-so-high-impedance headphones that still require extra power, such as planars.With my 2016 15"" MBP, I've had to use a portable amp for my Beyerdynamic DT 1990 Pros (250 ohm), but now I can pretty well do without it, though sometimes only just. The volume on some sources is still not always what I wish I could make it. But now I can nearly achieve hearing loss with the intro to the guitar riff in ""Money for Nothing."" Which also sounds good, and healthier, a couple notches down.Among other headphones that have tested favorably with the new jack are the DT 990 Pros (250 ohm), and the Sennheiser HD650, 660S, 6XX, and HD800 (150 to 300 ohm).One report says the planar Hifiman HE4XXs (35 ohm planar) sound good, but most planars tested are said to need more power. The Audeze LCD-2Cs are reported to sound good enough, though not their best. The LCD-3s and Hifiman Sundaras and Aryas are said to be underpowered.For my usual regular-impedance phones, Cleer Flow IIs (16 ohm), the wired volume is a little louder than before, though still not always the earsplitting barrage I want for some sources. Maybe for the best.Quality iems (in-ear monitors) that require especially clean input, but not too much, reportedly sound good, including Andromedas and Moondrop Starfields.SpeakersThey're improved from the already laptop-leading speakers from earlier MBPs, with a fuller sound and decent kick, amazingly good for when nothing with a 3"" woofer is around.Apple mysteriously says the 14"" M1 has the same speaker system, but looking inside both machines shows the speakers in the 16"" are bigger - both ""subs"" and tweeters - and located differently, with the subs in the front corners on this one. The 16"" has fuller bass (such as it is).Heat and NoiseThere isn't any.None with my typical use, at least. If you push it hard, it can get warm, but not as hot as my 2016 15"". Which makes sense, as this has a larger enclosure, bigger fans, larger, better heat sinks, and more power-efficient processors. The fans don't have to spin up as much to do the same amount of cooling, so it's noticeably quieter even when it does heat up, rarely makes any noise at all.The 16"" Max comes with a larger heat sink than the 16"" Pro, so likely runs a little cooler and quieter sometimes, though the Max might get hotter when it uses a lot of that extra power.KeyboardVery quiet, much like the older Mac laptop keyboards, not the butterfly ones from 2015-19, but the rest. Maybe less travel in the keys than some of those, but plenty for me.I miss the touch bar sliders for fine control of some functions, but you can still use sliders via the Control Center, the icon next to the date on the screen's top menu bar. That's also where control of the keyboard backlight is, no more control for it on the keyboard.TouchpadThe best available by far, responsive and large so you can carry the cursor over a large area with more control. For clicks, it's great. For taps, which I turn off, it's not as great, according to those who prefer that - appears to be a software issue.PortsThere's one less Thunderbolt/USB-C port than before, but 50% more bandwidth (3 controllers instead of 2).The HDMI is 2.0, can drive up to 4K HDR @60Hz.The SD card reader is shallow, so the cards stick out. There might be room for a flush micro-SD adapter. I only have cards up to 64GB, which work fine. Some people have had trouble reading some cards, so it may be finicky.Battery LifeI usually keep plugged in, but the reviews I've seen that cover battery life tests typically say it's the longest of any similar machine they've tested, including PCs. Reports of battery life for office work, browsing, watching videos, and so on generally range from 10 to 16 hours, sometimes more. It can go unusually long with heavy use too, 5 hours or more of video work, for example. Max Tech did 10 benchmark and stress tests with it in a couple hours, some maxing out the CPU or GPU for up to ten minutes, and it still had 36% left.At normal settings, there's no performance hit until you get down to 3%; until then you can process or game at full tilt. There's a low-power mode that extends battery life by limiting performance, lowering screen brightness, etc. The Max also has a high-power mode, but it seems to only ramp up the fans sooner to help cooling. Apple's description and tests in reviews indicate it doesn't affect performance in any direct way.The Max has tended to have a little less battery life than the Pro in reviews. The only good tests I've seen that compared directly either found negligible differences or up to 15% less battery life for the Max. (Other tests haven't been well controlled.)You can quick charge to 50% in a half-hour. The new power brick is 45% more powerful than before, and maybe 30% larger lengthwise, still small for what it does. You can charge at lower speed with smaller bricks (not included) via the USB-C ports.Size and WeightIt's noticeably heavier than before, about 5 ounces over the previous 16"", and not quite as sleek, but it's sleeker than I was expecting from the photos.RepairabilityHa ha! But really, it's better than it was. Battery modules now have pull tabs so they can be more easily replaced. The screen can be replaced more easily, but if Apple doesn't do it you lose True Tone (which I don't want anyway). The headphone, Thunderbolt and MagSafe ports can be replaced without replacing the logic board. Now rates a 4/10 from iFixit for repairability, up from 1/10 for the previous model.CompatibilityComes with Rosetta 2, which enables M1 Macs to use programs written for Intel Macs, and usually works very well.There's no more Boot Camp, so to run Windows or Windows programs you have to use third-party software like Parallels, which runs Windows by emulating a Windows machine (and requires a Windows license), or Crossover, which modifies Windows programs to run on Macs.  Which works best, or at all, depends on the program.GamingWoW *mostly* runs 50 to 120fps at high settings and resolution, depending on the location. Some places can't even manage 50 at those settings, though, but do OK at more compromised settings. Baldur's Gate 3, Diablo III, CS:GO and several others can run at 60-100fps or better at good settings.You can play Windows games via Parallels or Crossover. They generally don't run as well, but some do fine.Most games, including native ones, run quite a bit better on the Max, with up to 2x the fps. Final Fantasy XIV is hit and miss at good settings even with the Max.Gaming isn't usually hot or noisy, can get warmer with light fans for the games that aren't running natively. And there's no noticeable performance hit for gaming on battery.WorkI have to mention the less fun part: how well this does things you might have to do at work. It does almost all of it better than before, much of it way better. Here's how it compares according to actual test results from numerous sources with Xcode, Logic Pro, Lightroom, Blender, Final Cut Pro, Premiere Pro, and so on. The range of comparison depends on what the task is.Previous base MBP 16"" (Intel i7 AMD 5300): The Pro is 60% to several times faster.Previous top-spec'd MBP (i9 5600M): The Pro is about the same to 2 or 3 times faster.Regular M1 machines (not M1 Pro or Max): The Pro is about the same to several times faster.The 14"" M1 Pro with same specs: The same, though the 16"" has the bigger battery and heat removal system, so it fares better in those ways.Windows laptop work stations: This is complicated, but the Pro can thrash most Windows laptops in most intensive work-related apps. It lines up very roughly with machines with a good i7/i9 and an RTX 3070, but generally can't keep up with the RTX 3080. The Pro uses a fraction of the power, and so only produces a fraction of the heat and noise, if any. And lasts and performs much better on battery.Pro vs MaxThe Max is about the same to twice as fast as the Pro, mostly between those extremes. The CPU is much the same, but the GPU is double the cores, so the main advantage is in graphics-heavy work.Besides the GPU cores, the Max has twice the bandwidth for memory transfer, two hardware video encode engines instead of one, and some extra cooling capacity.If you're already successfully using a Mac laptop, you don't *need* the Max, since the Pro is already better than what you have. But that doesn't mean you can't benefit from the Max's extra power if you have the money. For intensive video editing, massive photo editing, or better gaming (though cheaper Windows machines will play most games better), the Max has real advantages.To confuse things a little more, Apple (but not Amazon currently) also offers a demi-Max with a 24-core GPU, halfway between the Pro's 16 and the Max's 32. It's a cheaper way to get the extra bandwidth, video encoder, and cooling advantages of the Max. Tests show that in graphics-intensive tasks it operates roughly midway between the Pro and 32-core Max, often more than half, as expected.WarrantiesThis comes with a one-year limited warranty against manufacturing defects that includes free phone support for the first 90 days. If you want to also cover accidental damage (with deductibles) and extend the regular warranty and free tech support to 3 years, you can buy 

AppleCare+ from Amazon

   (link embedded) or Apple. You get 60 days from purchase to buy it, but coverage for accidents doesn't start until you do. (I always self-insure when I can, so I didn't get it.)DecalsLast and least, this comes with two black Apple decals, the sign of true professional Apple equipment."
157,Out of the box unusable for me. This MacBook Pro does not have any USB ports to be able to restore from a previous Mac back up that’s on an external drive. You must buy an adapter. Since I live in a remote area I’d have to order online and wait. You cannot even plug a iPhone12 Pro Max directly into it. The only ports it has are thunderbolt. So even Apple’s own lighting connector needs an adapter. The keyboard is a downgrade from the old keyboard. Solid black plastic instead of plastic keys surrounded by aluminum which were easier to see. Had to call Apple support to download an update because there is no reset option in the System Preferences of OS Monterey. And the update did not work to give it that option. Will have to figure out a different option to remove my account and information to return it. This particular MacBook is defective I believe.
158,I ordered the 2021 16 inch right away as I knew they would probably sell out fast. I had to make sure I had one for my trip I am leaving on soon.  As soon as I opened it the screen would never come on.  Thought maybe it needed charging so I tried that.  Still nothing but a black screen.  It kept making the sound when you open it up even when it was closed over and over again.  I took it to the local Apple Store hoping I could get some answers.  They tired to get it to work and could not either.  They said it is very strange and maybe something happened to it during shipping.  They said since it is brand new it would be best to get my money back from Amazon.  I thought maybe I could just exchange it before my trip but the one I ordered is out of stock.  I will try the 14 inch and see if I like it compared to the size of the 16 inch since it is in stock.  This is a first MacBook Pro I have ever purchased and now I am a bit nervous.
159,"Here are the temperature results for the new cool MacBooks compared to the old overheating intel ones. 91 degrees for the old one near the processor, and 74 degrees on the new ones. Both had been running for hours transferring files nonstop. Amazing. I have been editing video, transferring large files and not once have the fans kicked on. Makes me want to cry."
160,"Finally, this 2021 MacBook Pro cured my depression!"
161,Arrived DOA - wouldn’t start up. Spent hours on the phone with Apple support and still wouldn’t start. Returned - c’mon man!
162,"This laptop is unbelievably fast. Between the screen, battery life, and performance, this laptop is head and shoulders better than any competition."
163,My first ever MacBook. Switched over from PC and I can't believe I didn't switch sooner! On the pricer side but I'm super happy with my purchase!
164,"I have been using my MacBook Pro from 2014 for work until last week when I finally purchased this MacBook Pro. My old MacBook starts up and works as fast as the day I bought it. The only reason I bought a new MacBook was because the battery life was getting low. I probably could have just bought a new battery and it would have been fine.That being said, I did hold out for this MacBook because Apple brought back the ports that I needed. I use the HDMI and SD ports daily. An Ethernet port would have been nice but that’s asking too much. This MacBook has a 2 day battery life and is blazing fast. I use Adobe programs and this MacBook doesn’t even blink when I do live editing. Best laptop I have ever used.I own a business that uses many PC laptops and a couple MacBooks. A PC will never last as long as a MacBook. And, a PC ALWAYS gets slower after 6 months of use. The price is high but you can buy a new PC every 2 years or a MacBook every 7 years."
165,"Coming from a 2019 16in, I feel that this generation is 2 steps forwards, 1 step back.Pros:-Fans are never audible even under full extended load!  This was my #1 issue with my 2019 mac which would have constant fan noise with 2 monitors.-2x battery life-Better screen especially in dark environment or a dark subject-Extremely fast for certain workloads such as video editing and code compilation.-magsafe is back (although I personally don't care for it)-most apps work normally with rosetta emulation, but may have some stutter.Cons:-thicker and SIGNIFICANTLY heavier.-Screen has a notch which is very distracting for me.-Still has some compatibility issues.-Terrible for games.  Only a few titles are supported natively.  I only tested league of legends(uses rosetta emulator), but it was choppy and 1/3 the fps of my 2019 intel macbook.- +$300 base price even though they got rid of intel.-The area I feel apple has made a major misstep is with ports.  I couldn't care less for SD card or HDMI, but everyone who buys this is going to need USB-A.  It's ridiculous that I still have to bring a dongle everywhere just to use my mouse but these ports I never/rarely use are back.Also some developer related tools/libraries aren't working.C# debugger is totally unsupported for example.  Anything that requires gpu hardware acceleration (pytorch) is unlikely to ever be supported in any usable form.  Linux dual boot is unsupported or in early experimental stages.  I also had issues building/running java projects natively, but no issues with rosetta.If you're looking to buy this for an undergrad program, it's probably workable.  However, I'd suggest saving some $ and getting a used mac or windows machine.  Professional devs will be aware of their specific requirements, but I suspect many will need to keep a secondary x86 machine for the foreseeable future."
166,"I am writing this review focused primarily on people who are considering jumping from the 13"" MacBook Pro to the 14"" MacBook Pro, which is what I did. I moved from the 13"" MacBook Pro M1 with 16gb of RAM to the 14"" MacBook Pro M1 Pro with 16gb of RAM.Size: So, 1"" of screen might not seem like a lot on its face, but the difference is pretty substantial, in my opinion. Even the pictures don't quite do it justice. The screen feels considerably larger in a package that isn't considerably larger. For me, it's the perfect sweet spot for someone who wants something larger than the 13"" model, but smaller than the 16"". I had a 16"" MacBook Pro i9 and it was just too much for me. This one feels perfect.Form Factor: The new 14"" and 16"" MacBooks both adopt a thicker chassis, which is shown in the pictures. As such, Apple decided to make the casing flat instead of gently rounded. It honestly reminds me of the pre-unibody builds, but still sleek and modern. If I didn't know this one was new and you just laid them side-by-side, I might say that the old form factor looks a little newer, but that isn't to say that it looks bad.Aesthetics: Overall, I touched on the aesthetics a bit in the ""form factor"" section. It looks like a high-end laptop, but at the same time I can see some people thinking it looks dated. I personally like the flatter look over the more rounded look, but it will depend on the person. Another thing I like is moving the ""MacBook Pro"" branding from under the screen to the bottom of the casing. I just think it provides a cleaner look during use. The black background of the keyboard is also a plus for me. The old space gray background was fine, but I really like the black.Function: Most people probably won't notice a massive difference in the previous iteration and the new iteration. For the 14"" and 16"" MacBook Pros, the touchbar has been removed. This will make a lot of people happy. For me, I was always pretty ambivalent about the touchbar, but I'm not going to complain about a key row there. The keyboard appears to have ever so slightly more travel and bounce. It's not a huge amount, but it is noticeable. I'll touch on The Notch later.Performance: My 13"" had the M1 chip and now my 14"" as the M1 Pro. So far, I haven't noticed a tremendous difference when using programs like Logic Pro, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Lightroom, but I wouldn't say those are super intensive programs. If you're exporting massive 8K videos, you might want to jump up to the M1 Max. One thing I have noticed is that the thermals are maybe a little bit worse. Just a touch. I have noticed it warming up a bit, but the fan still has not come on once. I only mention this because my 13"" M1 stayed cold at all times. It's not as bad as my i9, which sounded like a jet engine revving up while it jumped well over 100 degrees, but it's something to be aware of.The Notch: Honestly, so much has been made of the notch and I think it's mostly overstated. Yes, it's fun to meme the fact that Apple still hasn't found a way around the notch, particularly on iPhones, but it's really not a huge deal. Were it up to me, I would have just left a bezel up there, but I can understand why Apple didn't. I use a Dell XPS for work and it has razor thin bezels with no notch, but at the same time the camera is an absolute joke. Looks like it's from 2002.The Notch (cont'd): The notch behavior can be inconsistent from app to app, but not to the point where it's bothersome. I have seen some programs with very large nav menus up top bump the status bar out of the way to make room. And while this particular phenomenon is not something new for MacBooks, losing a big chunk of that bar to the notch will likely make this a more regular occurrence for people. Do I wish it didn't have a notch? Yeah, probably. Does it hurt the experience? Very, very little.Screen: For everyday indoor use, which is almost exclusively what I do, I think you will be hard-pressed to find a better screen on the market. The 120Hz refresh rate is something I waited a long time to get on the iPhone, so I was pretty shocked to see it implemented on the new MacBook Pros just a month later. It actually has more pixels/inch than the iMac 27"" 5K screen, which I also use pretty regularly. All-in-all, the screen is just the best in the business.Overall: It's a great and powerful laptop for someone who is wanting a little more than web surfing and word processing. I use mine primarily for recording music, as well as live performances using standalone plugins, so I need something that is powerful and easy to use. The MacBook Pro has always fit the bill, but now with the M1, M1 Pro, and M1 Max chips, I have absolutely no concern for performance or consistency.My 13"" M1 did just what I needed in this regard, but I'm someone who wanted a slightly larger screen without drastically increasing my footprint and weight. The 14"" MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip is just what I needed. If you're someone who needs absolutely top notch performance, I'd recommend upgrading the RAM and going with the M1 Max."
167,"I haven't upgraded my computer for more than a decade, so it would stand to reason any recent releases would impress me, but this macbook pro has gone above and beyond in the small time I've had it.The screen is truly something to behold. Smooth, clear, just beautiful. I don't typically care about bezels, but I might start. The expanded screen makes an unexpected difference. Meanwhile, I barely notice the notch. Apple said they'd find workarounds to make it scarce, and they have.The speakers are wonderful as well. I was skeptical at first -- thought I caught some tinny effects on a couple songs, but the more I listen to them, the more I'm convinced the tinniness was in the recording (it was a live album, which might explain it). As for the spatial audio, I've only heard a couple songs, but it's pretty trippy. This is my first experience with it, and it doesn't disappoint.In the short time I've had the computer, it's been nothing but fast. Probably more computer than I need, so if you're a sound editor or photographer, this review probably isn't for you. But for those of you casual users who want a solid machine that will last (as I said, my last macbook pro made it more than a decade), this is the one. Excited as I was for my last macbook, I could see room for improvement at the time. Right now, I don't see how things get better than this."
168,"M1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. Compared to previous MacBook Pro, it's a giant leap ahead. These tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the Macbook. This particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro,  but it still kicks butt. You can get the Pro Max chip and bump up the RAM to 64GB if you want - and add tons more storage. The 14 inch MacBook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. It can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. The display is stunning. Just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. The brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. Real HDR viewing -  a big difference. You will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. After 10 minutes I don't even notice it. It means nothing for your experience. Its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. Camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous MacBooks. Six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. Music/movies it feels like surround sound. For video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. The keyboard is a dream to type on. Very solid like all MacBooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. The Apple Magic Keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. Battery life is amazing. I have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. At best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! Especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it won't be 17 hours but I did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. The power efficiency is ground breaking. They have added back the MagSafe power plug - which is great! And added back an SD card slot and and an HDMI port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. I wish it had at least one USB-A old style port - but it doesn't. You get three USB-C thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. They got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro MacBooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. Apparently they listened to a lot of users who didn't really like the touch pad. The shape and style of this laptop is great. Some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. That is BS. I have been typing most of the day and I don't feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. Very comfy for typing. Some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new Macbook Pro, but I am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside -  this is an amazing laptop - the best Apple has ever made, hands down. And I would say you won't find a better power laptop anywhere.  All that said - this is not a gamers machine. Apple is not for hard core gamers. I mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. I am a hard core gamer and a PC geek  - I have a powerful windows PC for gaming. And always will. But for everything else. this MacBook is king. I use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. I can plut into a giant monitor if I want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch IPS panel. So if you are wondering if this Macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - I am here to tell you, its the real deal. I finally upgraded from my 2015 MacBook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. If you are thinking of getting one - you won't be disappointed. One last comment. I am an old timer windows guy, and I know all the counter arguments for the Mac. Many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. First, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new M1 Pro chips - you can't. And aside from that, the Mac OS is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text FROM A PHOTO! Whaaat? And the design/ergonomics/quality of these MacBooks is unmatched. So, yes you pay more - but you get more. My last MacBook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. If you want this laptop - get it! It rocks."
169,"I have a Mabook Pro covered by Apple care. The computer needs a new battery. To make a long story short Apple left me for months with a computer, again under warranty, which I can use for a couple of hours for simple tasks like web browsing before it needs to be recharged. Apple refused to replace the battery because the diagnostic read 81% not below 80 % as per policy. In all this Apple didn’t have any problems asking me to invest countless hours of my time between doing clean installs trips to apple stores etc.. I feel a more respectful way to treat me as a loyal customer could have been let us replace the battery first and if that doesn’t fix the issue which I seriously doubt ask me to do troubleshooting. All this to save something that would probably cost you few $$. Seriously ?"
170,sent me base model
171,"I probably got a faulty laptop but the charger status doesn’t show it’s charging when plugged in, only thing indicating that it’s charging is the orange light. My chrome windows keeps crashing whenever I put the computer to sleep and the external video display rarely connects"
172,"I never write reviews, but feel compelled to write one for this Macbook Pro. I've owned macs consistently since 1990s and have dealt with eye strain on the air and now on this laptop. It gave me horrible headaches and eye strain even with a matte protector. I returned it and am now looking at PCs for the first time because if I can't read from the screen without it making me sick, I can't use it."

   My first MacBook ever! I had been saving up for it before the official drop— & I was not disappointed! Love the Touch ID feature, and it’s so efficient! Can’t wait to use it when I go back to school!"
174,"This laptop has a superior display, superior speakers, superior camera and an excellent keyboard. Don't go cheap and buy the ""affordable"" MacBook Air base model like some of these talking heads have been advising. It's not a good buy if you are unhappy with it after six months, and believe me, you will be unhappy with 8 GB of RAM and two USB ports after six months. M1 MacBooks are not upgradeable so if you find that you need more RAM, you are stuck. Unless all you are doing sending emails, tweets, and watching TicTok, you will probably need something more, especially if you are using your laptop for work. I'm using my MacBook Pro with an LG UltraFine 5K 27 inch display as my desktop system, which replaces a 27 inch iMac. I'm very happy."
175,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Sheeeese! What can I say? Apple has done it again 🤪😍 magnificent piece of device I must say."
176,I'm a fan of apple products and I like almost everything about this new MBA. But it has one huge flaw that nobody talks about. It's the camera hardware and it hasn't been updated in ages. My zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light. A $1000 laptop with 10 year old front camera is unacceptable. Camera is very important to me. Especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time.
177,"Liked:- Long battery life (one charge WILL last all day, i.e. 16 hours. Personally tested true)- Speed (the new M1 processor really is fast)- Quiet (no fan but the laptop still does not get hot)- Light and portable- High resolution & bright displayDisliked:- As with other MacBooks, the keyboard is mediocre especially compared to laptops like Lenovo Thinkpad- Incompatible applications (With the M1 processor still being new, you might experience existing programs frequently crash. For example, Chrome keeps crashing) But I would guess there will be a fix soon"
178,"UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable.The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long.Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using ""swap memory"" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board.***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB.I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models.There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD.***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly.------I purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12"" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1.The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco.I likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive ""Pro Apps"" running at the same time.I would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.I would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball ""not responding"" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1. If however, you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable, faster and cooler running than the Intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable Mac."
179,"The M1 chip really is amazing. But it only lasted five days for me. Somehow mine managed to break after using a third party USB C hub. The screen wouldn’t turn on at all, and an Apple repair tech couldn’t figure it out after doing a few quick tests. Oh and then Apple said it would take a month to replace it with a new one."
180,"Beautiful laptop. I’ve upgraded from the MacBook Air of old...so far this laptop has blown it away. It wasn’t overly pricey to be honest and I feel it’s worth the price. Overall look is great and keyboard feel is nice. Larger touchpad is great, I’ve paired my Magic Trackpad 2 with it as well."
181,"I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13"" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13"" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.Good:- SCREEN looks great!  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  I usually don't go above 50% brightness.- KEYBOARD is good.  Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard.  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic.  Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great.  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.- LOOKS GREAT.  Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.- NO FAN.  That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.- PERFORMANCE.  It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time.  For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU.  Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27"" (top end) with Intel chips.- TOUCH ID is great still.  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons.  On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA.  Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch).  You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay.  And so on and so forth.- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.NOT GOOD:- WEBCAM still sucks.  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc.  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27"" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera).- ONLY 2 PORTS.  Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort).  Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame.  I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.OVERALL:A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem.  Love it so far!"
182,No complains so far.  Very fast and performs great.  I had a 2014 MacBook Air and finally upgraded this year.  This is leagues beyond that entry and I’m very happy with this upgrade.
183,"Lightweight, blazing fast, easy to use, battery life is incredible with the new Apple M1 chip.  A typical Great Apple product.However, there is only a Thunderbolt port, so you now have to go out and buy a cable to convert USB to thunderbolt (if you want to use a backup hard drive) or other USB items, AND, I had to buy yet another cable to sync my phone's lightning port to the thunderbolt port on the computer. Total $56.I LOVE Apple product, and worked for them in my caerer, but I would wait on buying this version until the software for it has been developed.UPDATE: After several months of using this computer, I have have found several things of concern:1.  my notification center keeps disappearing, despite my constant reinstalling the widgets.2.  my computer's calendar, reminders, and photo stream do not sync with my IOS devices (iPhone & iPad).  If I add an item to calendar on my phone, it will appear on my mac but not vice versa.  Reminders will not sync regardless of which device I originate the item on.I have contacted Apple support on all these issues and they cannot solve the problem.IT APPEARS THAT THE BUGS HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED OUT, YET.  THINGS ARE MADDENINGLY CLUNKY!"

   Bought this laptop bc i needed it for spring semester and i needed an upgrade from my heavy macbook pro. I go to work too so i needed something super light and thin i can just bring everywhere and slide it in my bag.I am obsessed with how fast this macbook is. The battery life is on point. I used it for movies and series at work and it lasted for 3 days. The processor is definitely sooo good. I open so many tabs at once and it has not lagged on me. The keyboard and trackpad is responsive.I love the color. The main reason why i bought this too. 😍😂I have no problems with it at all.Highly recommend"
185,Opened my brand new $1000++ computer and the entire screen was cracked and destroyed. Awesome! Thanks Amazon.
186,"I pulled the trigger on this thing hoping that the bad reviews were wrong.. some of the comments saying it came dirty and defective definitely gave me pause however, what arrived today was practically a brand new macbook. the device does not show any signs of wear and the battery cycle count is 18, it came with the original power brick and while the cable was used, it was not worn or dirty in any way. While i've only just started using the device about an hour ago, I can tell you that it's speedy and works flawlessly... had I not known it was a refurb when buying it, I would have easily confused it for a brand new mbp.. for those asking, this is a 2017 macbook pro and the specs as quoted are accurate. i'll play around with this thing for a little while and update this review as needed, but so far this looks like a winner!***update***A few months in and it’s still working flawlessly. I don’t regret my purchase for one second, and neither should you!"
187,This is not a 256GB MacBook Pro- they are falsely advertising it as such and then shipping buyers 128GB versions.
188,"Came in used and dirty, and it was not even turn off, I'm gonna return it. So disappointed."
189,"Wow. I cant say enough how happy I am with this laptop! I it arrived early, and for a refurbished computer I swear it doesn't have a scratch, dent, smudge or single flaw anywhere on it! Its fast, the battery is great, its working perfectly! I couldn't be happier with this thing!"
190,"Was excited to receive it and on the outside it had one noticable chip in the case on the cover side (which had a sharp edge to it), but thought that isn't too bad.  But when opening it up the screen in both the top left and top right were broken/chipped/cracked like it had been dropped and they replaced the cover, but not the screen.  This was not acceptable.  Wanted to try it out and ended up learning that some of the keys did not work right (sticky, pushed strange and such), plus the touchpad/mouse was really strange and didn't seem to work correctly.  Too many issues out of the box for me and too concerned that there might be other issues from where it looked to have been dropped and such.  Sending it back and just started that process.  So far the return seems ok....but just hate that the product does not match the description...using their words ""Renewed products work and look like new""."
191,"I ordered the space gray with 256 gb of ram and received a silver with 128gb.  I knew this could happen as the picture did not match the description and I had seen other similar reviews.The good news is it was on time and in flawless condition.  I think I will stick with it and not press my luck, as it is still a fair price and a great machine, but beware."
192,"I have to admit, I don't typically write reviews and I was a little hesistant about the product due to some 1 to two star reviews. The space gray model not only is at a great price, it came to me brand new. With all the specs I was expecting, i5 8GB RAM 256GB SSD, and works like a dream. Battery life is great, setting up was easy, and all my Apple Products (iPhone, Apple watch, Earpods) synced with no issues. I'm not sure as to why there were so many negative reviews, but mine is not one of them. SO HAPPY!! I truly recommend."
193,the battery is dead
194,"This product arrived quickly and looked great.  There have been multiple glitches with the power switch and with the screen ever since it's arrival.  Most of the time the power button would require multiple attempts to push before the computer would power up.  When the computer woke from sleep state (opening lid after its been closed for at least fifteen minutes) the screen would be black and then all pixelated.  Most recently, the computer wouldn't even turn on, when it finally did, it was all reset and all the settings were reset.  I lost everything I had put on the computer over the past day.  The seller still hasn't gotten back to me after email and I left a voice message.  I have now initiated a return as I want my money back.  It would have been nice if they had gotten back to me ASAP when I emailed or when I called (during normal hours of operation, by the way) and it went to voicemail.  The fact that they didn't and the computer kept coming up with other issues.  I now will buy a new one.  The value is not there with the aggravation generated."
195,"Multiple reviews mentioned getting devices with used batteries, screen issues, etc.My laptop arrived through FedEx Express with questionable packaging. But everything was intact and fine. The laptop still had the plastic wrapped around it as MacBooks directly from Apple do, even with the screen cover. Only 3 battery cycles out of the box, with a new charger in the box. I am very satisfied with the purchase although in the Q&A section of this product someone mentions that this is a 2018 model, its not, its a 2017 (At least the one I received.) which for me isn't really a big deal since it arrived in exceptional condition. Highly recommend this MacBook."
196,"Delivered to me within 12 hours of purchase... Sealed in original apple packaging with protective film, blemish free, not a scratch.. Mint.its powerful, Ive already loaded some big task audio software and broadcast software on it and its flying through the multiple processes together at ease... (Logic 10.5 / Traktor DJ 3.0 / OBS)Super light and portable, If this is a MacBook Pro then I can't even imagine how light the Air models are. Nor could I even imagine why you may need something more powerful. I am having to adjust to the new keyboard and Touch Bar, I keep hitting Siri and volume settings, even as I type this.id also recommend getting a keyboard cover as well.... I hear these keyboards go out sometimes and to repair it. This is no fault to the reseller, but I can't believe Apple with their price points don't offer a bigger SSD for the lowest price point.... 128gb is laughable so be prepared to buy an external SSD along with a Thunderbolt 3 / USB-C Hub to run hdmi, and various external accessories.Overall I love this computer so far, it was a nail biter as I rarely ever shell out $1,000 on anything but I'm very pleased and satisfied with my purchase. And I still cannot find a better deal on the internet, not even used on Facebook marketplace, letgo or craigslist....Five stars"
197,So not worth it. All they want to do is take your money do NOT BUY THIS ONE! Its used and if you search apple on amazon they have brand new with higher stats for cheaper.
198,"Just received this, but so far so good. It looks BRAND NEW. There are literally NO signs of cosmetic wear or damage. It arrived in a sealed apple box. I’m finishing setting up and I already love it. For just under $1,200 for a 2019 model, this is a GREAT deal!"
199,"I really love my MacBook. I really love this laptop. I'm a huge MacBook fan and this works like new. So far I don't have a problem with the butterfly keyboard, but I heard bad reviews about the keyboard from watching YouTube videos. I think that they may have fixed the keyboard problem when they refurbished the product??? I'm not sure, but honestly this a really great laptop for a really great price. I do wish that it came in the original Apple box and packaging, but it wasn't far from the really deal."
200,"It looks and feels brand spanking new! Definitely happy with my purchase considering that I bought a brand new 2020 MacBook Air and hated it. Returned it back in 2 days. I paid a lot less for the Pro than the Air and its A LOT better with so many features. I’m not trying to persuade anyone out of getting the Air but if you are considering on buying a MacBook my advice would be to just go ahead and get the pro. The Air reminds me of a google chrome book slapped with an Apple logo on it. Not saying that google chrome books are bad, but there’s no need to pay a full band for the Air when you could find something similar and a lot cheaper. All in all I really love this laptop."
201,"Bought this laptop with some apprehensions, as i have typically bought refurbished goods from apple directly. This was my first from amazon, and i was not disappointed. The notebook was flawless, not a single scratch on it. second, all the accessories where flawless as well, not signs of usage. When i powered on the notebook to verify usage, the battery had cycled only 3 times, meaning it was still in new condition. Very highly recommended seller. Thanks for a pleasant transaction."
202,"This laptop looked new, straight from Apple store."
203,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   The screen arrived damaged, what a scam.!"
204,"Although I was very skeptical about purchasing a ""refurbished"" MacPro, after reading the reviews for this company, I made the purchase.  The MacPro arrived earlier than expected, expertly wrapped, included Apple certified, and in NEW condition.  There is no way I could tell it was not new or refurbished.  The price was the best I could find after researching other sellers.  I would highly recommend iPower Resale Inc to anyone looking for a MacPro.  Their customer service is exceptional.  Thank you for a great product!  5*****"
205,"When I looked at this product it only had one review and it was a bad one... I then checked all the other products the seller sold and the reviews were excellent, needless to say I took a chance and ordered this MacBook Pro 2019. It arrived before anticipated and it was securely package. I AM SO GLAD I took a chance on them because this MacBook is amazing! Now I’ve waited a couple months before reviewing it to make sure it works. The MacBook looks brand new, it didn’t have any dents or scratches. It works and performs like a new MacBook. I had to contact the seller over the a small issue with the charger and they went above and beyond to correct the issue.Excellent customer service excellent product. I recommend this seller to anyone!"
206,This is by far the best laptop ive ever owned! The laptop came with 0 scratches and only 16 battery charges on it. It even came with the apple box and stickers! Highly reccomend for the price. $850 is great for a 2019 macbook air.
207,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Everything I expected and more! Just like brand new!"
208,I love this laptop so so much. I think everyone should get it. The model is between 2018-2020 and the one I got had the Touch ID on it! Everything was very easy to set up and is in such great quality!
209,"Received in a timely manner.  Will review in a couple weeks.Well, it's been over 2 weeks since receiving my MacBook Air and I have to admit that it has proven to be worth it's price. The Retina display is phenomenal and it's compact chassis is just what I was looking for. I am not a power user, so I didn't need major memory capacity. The speakers are, surprisingly, crisp and clear for such a slim build. The fingerprint scanner is quick and a huge convenience. I am (or was) a long-time PC user and resisted getting an Apple, but the transition was smooth and Apple's claim to fame for being user-friendly and intuitive proved true. If you are looking for a compact, yet capable laptop with QWERTY keyboard, I would recommend this product."
210,"After having the laptop a few months, I can say my leap of faith to buy an amazon refurbished was worth it BUT I had to work a little bit.  It didn't arrive perfect and it still isn't perfect.  There is a tiny white dot on the screen where some pixels died (I guess) and when I first got it, I had to call Apple support to get iMessage and Facetime to work on it.  Then I had to take it to the Apple store to get the keyboard fixed as some keys would not work.  Thankfully, I had Apple Care on it so the cost to get it shipped off and fixed wasn't bad.  Overall, I am happy with my purchase and I recommend this seller, but I will probably buy new next time."
211,"** I have only had the laptop for a week, this review is only based off of the time I have had it**I was so nervous to buy a refurbished computer but this came like it was brand new. New packaging, new charger, spotless laptop. I was worried the battery would be bad and wouldn’t hold a charge. I was wrong. I downloaded over 12,000 photos and was on it nonstop for over 2 days without even having to charge it. I am in love with this!!!"
212,"As in the description exactly, thank the seller for the fast shipping and good packaging"
213,I love this laptop and I’m really happy with all the features. Would definitely recommend.
214,Exactly as expected. Great value.
215,"The product made a loud buzzing/grinding airplane-type noise as soon as it finished setting up which was truly deafening. I presume it was the fan producing this aggravating sound. No programs were running and the room was approximately 68 degrees Fahrenheit so overheating should not have been an issue. Since no computer should ever sound like a coffee maker at any time, I must conclude that it was defective. Return to sender."
216,Exceeded my expectations! Some of the reviews had me a bit nervous but I can’t tell you how happy I am! The laptop is on almost brand new condition! Only 1 TINY nick on the front (you can’t see it unless your looking) and it was perfectly ready for me to set up my account! No issues or problems! It comes in a box perfectly protected and has the charger to go with as well👍🏼 So happy with it! Thank you!
217,"I was so excited because this laptop came in perfect condition. But when I tried to change the unsername to my name it wouldn’t work. 3 calls to Apple later, and I find out this computer is owned by a school that can remotely access my laptop at any time. Meaning, if they wanted to they could shut down and erase my laptop. Amazon gave me a full refund but I am very sad and disappointed"
218,"All in all, the laptop works great! It runs fast, it’s clean, and it’s perfect for what I needed it. The one disappointment I have it they claimed this product as a catagory A which means like new. When it arrived, the screen had two scratch marks on it that was discolored from the rest of the screen. I would understand like new for any other part to have a scratch, but the screen is a big deal and it should have mentioned that in the details."
219,"This MacBook Air is amazing!  I had been previously using a 2007 MacBook Air and it was time to upgrade.  I have never purchased refurbished before so I really didn't know what to expect, though was greatly concerned.  Needless to say that this laptop heavily exceeded my expectations.  Other reviewers stated that their MacBook was not as described, though mine looks brand new.  The keys are still crisp and clean, the screen immaculate.  There are a few light scratches on the outside of the computer (mostly the underside), but it is very minimal and unnoticeable.It runs like a dream, though I have only begun using it.  I will update should the computer have any issues.  It is an early 2015 with 4 GB RAM and its OS is Sierra.  I wanted to share that, as I found the Q&A to be a little confusing on that point and other reviews didn't really mention it."
220,"When I received this package, I was thrilled...until I tried to turn it on and got a “low battery” notification...for 16+ hours. Turns out the cord provided (not a Mac product) is not the correct wattage to charge this device. It’s hard to tell at this point if the computer is faulty or not now that I’ve purchased a new cord from Best Buy, but it shuts down as soon as it’s disconnected from power. The screen is pretty floppy, too- falls back without provocation. All of which seem like things that should have been mentioned in the details before I decided to purchase.After taking this computer to the Apple store, I was informed that the issue was indeed the battery- completely bad and had to be replaced. Again, something that I wish I had known before purchasing. It is in working order now, but doesn’t meet my standards of what “certified refurbished” means, and product details lacking for sufficient purchasing knowledge ahead of time."
221,"It said I had to do an update. When I hit the only update allowed it said the latest version was already installed but it wouldn’t let me go foward.  Also the screen seemed loose.  So if it was cleared out they never installed the new software correctly. So it wouldn’t let me even get to the main screen.  Others had luck but I did not.Also when I plugged the power bar in. It had a bit of a shock come out. As an electrician, I know that was a big no no.  I was willing to spend the money and get the correct power cord. But with everything else. I thought that’s already 3 strikes. No thanks."
222,I was very hesitant buying a used MacBook from Amazon but it turned out great! Looks new and works amazingly. You will receive exactly what was described. I have no complaints!
223,"Good quality, arrived early. As-new condition. Easy to install from my old machine via time machine backup. The old one was a 2010, now we are good for another 5-7 years.Thanks"
224,I have been struggling with this product since day one. I am not getting responses from the seller OR the extended warranty repair company.I have never had trouble with Amazon before. Every issue I have ever had has been settled with ease and courtesy.This has not. Made more devastating as it it is the largest purchase I have had and the product has been unusable almost since day one. We sent it to the extended warranty place who said they fixed it but it still doesn’t work.We have spent hours at Apple doing diagnostics and it is simply not functional. To repair it would cost more than I paid. They do not think that the parts it was refurbished with are even Apple parts.This was a terrible product and not worth the money.
225,"I bought this Mac and it came with a non Apple charger, I bought this as travel computer, sure enough in the first week while I was in Europe I had to buy am authentic Apple charger at $117. Now a month  later my Mac has died. It was having issues as in when I tried to maximize the scene with Netflix it would just shrink to a 3x5"" screen volume,  also the screen had been replaced before I bought it and is not well attached, very disappointed, I bought this last summer, but only started to use it in October when I was traveling, so I spent close to $700 for a Mac that lasted 2 months, return and replacement window has ""closed"" so I am stuck with a hefty repair bill."
226,"Was very iffy about buying refurbished but it’s honestly like new! There are a couple of LITTLE scratches but nothing noticeable! Compared to my friends MacBook Air that she paid 1100$ for and they are the absolute same. Best $500 I’ve ever spent. & the company is AWESOME! The charger didn’t work as soon as I got it & I emailed them. Within an hour I had an email from them and they were sending me a new charger, thankful my friend had her charger that I used until I received mine but the battery last like 2-3 days so it wasn’t that bad."
227,"Seller: IT5050Wowie! My son wanted an Apple Computer for Christmas and I was not about to spend $1000+ on a laptop for a 11-year-old boy. But a refurbished MacBook was definitely priced more appropriate for him. This computer is AMAZING people!!! Looks so clean and new. Only a couple faint scratches on the bottom, the keyboard looks like it was hardly touched, screen is clear and no burn marks in it, plus the battery is great. The seller was so awesome to get me this gift in time for Christmas, they are quick to respond to emails and followed up to make sure it was delivered afterward. (seriously, the nicest people!) I had purchased another renewed MacBook from another seller, and their level of quality wasn’t as good, by far. I wish I could pre-select a quality grade for the laptop (excellent, good, fair, etc.), so it is a little scary just leaving it up to the unknown. I work in the retail business and I like to applaud small companies who sell quality products. Do yourself a favor and go here, they gave me a laptop that is stellar and eased my worries about a refurbished laptop. It really looks so good and is operating perfectly. This is such a smarter way to buy a computer, especially for kids, or if you like to have the pricier brands without spending the high price. – Happy Mommy!"
228,"Wow! Bought this from TECHarvard and was claimed to be Certified Refurbished, which according to the Amazon description should show limited to no signs of wear.  Well the device that I received not only was pretty scratched on the bottom, had a huge ding on the corner of the top cover, but the keyboard showed more signs of wear than the MacBook that I've had for 5 years(Space bar was completely warped).  Definitely does not resemble a new device in any way shape or form.  If they are selling used devices, call them used and mark the price down accordingly.  This is definitely going back."
229,"Overall the laptop is nice. A couple of marks on the outside but works relatively well. There was an issue with the battery that originally came with it. It would shut off around 65% battery life. I asked the seller for a replacement battery, which they gave to me free of charge. However, the replacement battery is not originally an Apple battery and instead a knock off. This issue prompted it to restart randomly no matter what the battery life was at. I’m putting the original battery back in and having Apple replace it with the appropriate battery for an additional fee. I got what a paid for and I won’t make the mistake of buying a refurbished Apple product from anywhere other than the Apple store again."
230,This is the BEST purchase I’ve ever made! The laptop 💻 arrived on time and in MINT condition. It functions beautifully and works flawlessly for my personal and business needs. I would recommend this seller to any & all I know who are in the market for reliable and affordable devices.
231,"Battery doesnt work! I travel to another country with the laptop and web I turned on and unplug it, it shuts down! And in Battery Options appears ""Replace now"". How you can help me? I'm in Ecuador now and wont be back in a year!"
232,"I love my new MacBook Air, it came as expected (relatively like new condition). This my first Mac and I’d purchase it again refurbished, you save greatly and get almost the same product 😀"
233,Bought certified refurbished ended up with a unit with a screen covered in dead pixels. I contacted apple to see how much a screen replacement should be more I'm looking a repair cost more than I paid for the laptop.
234,"DO NOT BUY!!! I purchased this computer for about two month and one day I couldn’t turn it on after it goes into sleep mode for a long time. It just wouldn’t turn no matter what I do, I tried every single method out there. I had to press the power button a hundred times for it to finally turn on. But after a while even that won’t work. The computer is just dead. I had to take it to the computer store and they told me it costs $434 to fix it!!!! Even though I actually paid to get it fixed I recommend everyone do not buy!! It’s not worth the money and will cost you more!! The guy in the computer store told me that there is corrosion inside the motherboard and in order to fix it it costs a lot of money ($434). I am truly upset and wished I would have just bought a brand new one from apple that’s the newest version and which will cost me less than what I spent on this computer!!"
235,"The laptop worked great the first week. Eventually, things started to decline and quickly.  I would constantly have to change the time clock, and that would prevent many apps from working properly or not at all. I also discovered that my webcam did not work. I asked customer service if I could get a replacement laptop, and they gave me a website to help me fix it myself. It did not work. Also, the computer would start dying very quickly, even after a full charge. I would also not start up automatically, even with the charger plugged in. I had to press to start button almost endlessly for it to just power on. Eventually, it just would not cut on at all, even with the charger plugged in. It’s completely dead. Apple says that it should cut on with the charger plugged in if it were a battery issue, so it’s definitely something wrong with it beyond that and it will cost upwards of $400 to fix. I’m totally bummed. It did not even last a year."
236,"BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY MOTHER, SHE IS 70 YEARS OLD AND BARELY USES THE LAPTOP.THE SCREEN IS IN THIS STATE, APPEARS TO BE PEELING! VERY BAD!!"

   Note: My purchase was completed through Kanga Supply for this item that ultimately doesn't function as intended.Amazon Renewed item descriptions indicate that the products should work and look like new, which wasn’t the case for this purchase, ergo my poor rating. After only having the Macbook for less than a day, I was forced to reach out to the seller because the product no longer functioned as intended.CONSThe Macbook worked fine for the first hour or so of use, but during an update, the screen flickered vigorously (see video). I hoped it was just a fluke, and it led me to believe there may be some software or hardware-related issue. After having the Macbook for less than 12 hours, I was forced to reach out to the seller because the screen flickering caused the laptop to become unusable (see picture). I also came here to draft a review in hopes that my issue is resolved quickly and effectively. I'll update my review once this is complete.PROSAfter removing the laptop and inspecting the outside, I was pleased. The outside of the Macbook is in good condition, just one or two visible scratches or marks.The charger was not the original Apple charger (as other reviews have indicated) but an OEM adapter. I don’t care that much about whether it’s an Apple charger, as long as it functions.Specs match the advertised item I purchased:128GB SSD8GB ramEDIT/UPDATE: After reaching out to the seller as instructed with the Amazon Renewed products, I never got a response in the allotted timeframe (2 business days) and was forced to reach out to Amazon directly. Ultimately, this item was returned for a refund.UPDATE 2: Today is 1/13/2020 and I have still yet to see this problem resolved to my satisfaction (refund or exchange of working product), after having ordered this product on 12/26/2019. Highly disappointed both in Amazon and the third-party seller.UPDATE 3: Received a replacement Macbook on 1/15/2020. So far it seems to be working, no issues with the screen per the previous item received (was NOT the same item sent back, verified by serial number). Pleased so far with this item."
238,"The 2015 Macbook Pro is still, in my opinion, the best Macbook even in 2019.  I use the SD card reader all the time and have several USB 3.0 devices.  I also use a newer 2017 quad-core i7 for work (no choice) but the difference in speed is not worth the added money and lacking ports.  When I actually put the newer 2017 to work, the heat issue is still a challenge for Apple and performance drops.  It's like having power that I can't actually use unless I sit in a walk-in freezer. Don't quote benchmark speed tests to me, what counts is actual performance sitting at my desk for hours at a time working on a project. I also prefer the magsafe power (although this one uses the magsafe II which I like less than magsafe I which had a more solid connection) This one, I purchased for my wife and it handles everything she needs it to do. Although you can't upgrade the memory on these models, so make sure you get enough for what you need.  If you want to change out memory, then the best choice is the Mid 2012 non-retina model which also come with DVD drives and has USB 3.0 ports."
239,"First off, I am removing a star because they shipped a counterfeit 60W Magsafe 2 charger with my order. I contacted them immediately and they offered to accept a return of everything. I explained that the charger was my only complaint and they overnight FedEx'd a genuine Apple replacement for free.""we sent you the wrong adapter for this batch of order and will overnight you the correct genuine one.""So they knowingly ship counterfeit chargers with some of their orders?The computer is pretty good cosmetically and operationally, but not as great as other reviewers. It is an Early-2015 12,1 model, this one was built in 12/2016. There is a crease over the right USB port from somebody yanking a USB plug. The battery has 107 cycles (89% life left). Keyboard and display are in great shape with no flaws. The SSD has no dead cells. It came with MacOS 10.13 installed.Overall its a good laptop and decent refurbishment job.EDIT: Knocking off another star. They sent me another counterfeit charger. Apple would never loosely jumble the cord in the box, a genuine power supply doesn't stay powered on for several seconds after it's unplugged from the main or stay lit green/orange after its unplugged from the laptop and this fake only puts out 25 watts max."
240,"I really feel like I got a great deal on this, mine arrived in brand new condition and it looked like it had never been used. I did see some people had bad experiences but mine was well worth the price tag. The only negative was that the charger provided is third party and not OEM Apple. The box is also generic and not Apple, not a big deal but you just don't get that same feeling opening it up as a new product. I will say that I checked the serial number on Apple and the computer itself was only a couple of years old, so in reality I paid around $450 for an Apple that was only a couple of years old with a decent amount of battery life still left. I only bought this as there was certain tasks that I could not do on my iPad and so I did not need a brand new super powerful computer. This one is great, does not get hot, fans are silent and the display looks incredible.Overall I was very happy with the purchase, it came fast and was like new condition at the fraction of the cost of a new one. I actually waited a few months before writing this review so that I could also include that I have had no issues at all in that time, battery lasts a decent amount of time and no software or hardware issues to report. It also runs the latest OS that I updated it to and I believe it will be supported software wise for some time to come. Completely worth the price!"
241,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   The Macbook came in working condition with all original components and an OEM charger but not with the extension cord. The major downfall is the condition of the laptop, for the above average asking price for this model I expected great condition as it is stated to be like new but instead the model I received was in okay condition (not cleaned either, large collection of gunk in hinge vent) at best with a lot of edge scratches and deep cuts throughout the chassis, and some unremovable stains from stickers! And worst of all the battery was at over 500 cylces, the battery life was 4-5 hrs max! thats horrible for whats suppose to be a renewed device! Not satisfied!EDIT:  Avoid this entire listing especially from the seller ''Easymobiledevices'', they ship dirty grade b laptop and have poor costumer service."
242,Once i started running it all sort of problems arises. First major problem is wifi drops off and will not let you connect to wifi. After this happens you cant even turn on/off the wifi. Used guest and still no wifi. Restarting or shutdown and restart will not activate wifi. If you restart it takes so long to reboot. Sometimes it get stuck on the waiting wheel on startup. One out of ten restart wifi will work for a minute but then drops off and you will no longer be able to connect again. I cant say anything physically because it looks fine. Lastly beware it shows and says freshly installed mojave os but it has instead sierra installed. The power cord looks like an imitation and not the original one because from the weight it is not the original one. I can tell because i have multiple macbook at home and that is not the original one. I am pretty disappointed with this seller.
243,"I’ll update 15 days from today.CONS:-Delivery packaging: it was a regular box with one thick bubble wrap to protect the laptop.First glance, the charger seems pretty beat up but seems to work fine.-The outer top of the laptop has a lot of scuff marks and scratches. Sides do as well. Nothing TOO severe.-Bottom have some scratches and wearing on the rubber, not too noticeable.PROS:-Had a full battery-Set up went smoothly with no hiccups.-Outer signature glowing Apple works well.-Opening the laptop, the screen has no visible scratches, cracks, or scuffs at all.-Keyboard has no loose keys and is glowing well.-Trackpad has no scratches and works really well no weird working sides SO FAR.-Software automatically updated to Catalina, kinda wanna wait to update to Big Sur.I’ll update March 13, 2021"
244,"Still a GREAT LAPTOP, arguably the best MacBook Pro 13” ever made, 2 or 3 iterations later! I have had mine for 3 months now and although I was a little disappointed that I got a no-brand MagSafe power brick instead of an Apple brand, it’s caused no problems for me. I have been using Logic Pro X a lot and it runs nice and smooth even with the haphazard way I use it, leaving muted unused tracks all over the place as I learn about things like track bouncing and experiment with every single effect and different audio formats (I feel bad sometimes like I am unnecessarily abusing the laptop, lol) and I haven’t frozen or crashed at all. I have used a few emulation programs for old Saturn, Super Famicom, PS and Dreemcast games that push the 2D sprite and parallax scrolling envelope and again I haven’t had any problems. Only thing I have experienced that has been an issue is the actual Mac OS and it’s limitations with regard to formats, programs that it supports and connectivity with outside developers but I have also been able to get around that by setting Virtual Machines up and GUID partitioning to use whatever other OS I need. This is also not a complaint about the hardware itself but rather the Mac OS software so should not be considered when it comes to the actual MacBook Pro 13”.You will want to upgrade to an NVME M2 SSD at least 256 GB or 512 GB right away, as the 128 GB SSD will fill up within 2-3 months of moderate use and the newer M2s will increase the OS loading speed more than anything else. Luckily you have your pick of great SSDs like the Samsung 970 Evo, etc that you can easily swap in with a $5 adapter, a screwdriver and no soldering (just search YouTube for “MB Pro 13 2015 SSD upgrade”)…The unique things and PROS about this MB Pro 13” are the older style KEYBOARD that doesn’t break like 2016-later model keyboards do, 2 USB 3 ports, an SD CARD R/W and a FULL SIZE HDMI PORT all built in. This is the last MB Pro 13 with any of those ports on board and the fact that you can swap SSD hard drives with no soldering and very little skill needed, all-in with the M2 you get a sexy little powerhouse for half the price of the newer model Pro 13”s (1/4 price of current gen)! The rest (CPU, onboard graphics, sound/speakers) make this laptop a must have that will likely only appreciate in value $$$!Two Thunderbolt 2/miniDisplayPorts are useful if you want to setup 2-3 Screens, but the CONS Are that you get NO ThunderBolt 3/USB-C ports and more and more adapters and devices require that connection these days, though with the USB 3 ports there are ways around it, complicated as they may be. You also CANNOT UPGRADE RAM unless you know how to de-solder the current ram and solder up new ram (accepts up to 16GB DDR-3 in 2X8GB formation) and setup the machine to accept the new ram, which seems a recipe to completely destroy the board/laptop without at least some Mac building & Mac hardware programming know-how, possibly even special equipment.MAKE SURE YOU GET THE MODEL WITH THE AMOUNT OF RAM YOU NEED BUILT IN & a CPU that will be sufficient for you and you won’t be disappointed with this awesome little 6 year old laptop! Don’t get the 4 GB model even if it will “work” for you “short-term”! I got the 8GB/i5 2.9Ghz/128GB and I already regret not paying another $100 for the 16GB ram model, but c’est la vie.Just buy this MacBook Pro 13” while you can, replace the SSD as soon as possible, enjoy it, keep it another 5-10 years and you will likely be able to triple your investment by reselling it assuming Apple stays on their current trajectory with their MB Pro Hardware releases!!!"
245,"Hi, I bought this Macbook Pro 13"" early 2015 and received last week on Aug 23th. The laptop has a good appearance and doesn't have any flaws. However, the charger(45w) packed together with the macbook is not for macbook pro but for  Macbook Air. I just found out today, cuz when I use the charger(45w) laptop cpu temperatures goes up to 65-85 celcius. and I can't use more than 4 hours. But when I charge my macbook with Macsafe 1 (85w, which is for Pro), the cpu temperature keeps 40-50 degree, and it runs around 10hours. I want to change my charger into “MacBook Pro Charger 85w”. Thank you."
246,I'm very dissatisfied with this purchase.I can't use the Mac because the hard drive was not reset and the software on the Mac dose not allow you to use it.Also there was no charger.Again very disappointed.
247,"Looks brand new, wrapped and sealed in Apple packaging. Plugged it in and turned it on and let it go. Absolutely no problems, it was automatic and wonderful to have the computer set itself up. Has performed flawlessly as expected of an Apple laptop."
248,"The laptop arrived in fair condition.  The screws show signs of wear so it may have been opened up during the ""renewal"" process.  Old stickers were left on the bottom. Also, the laptop was shipped with a cheap knockoff Chinese charger.  I have no reason to trust this charger so I'll have to order a genuine Apple one instead.Fortunately I don't need this machine to be a workhorse or I would send it back.  This should survive a year at least but I don't trust it as-is - I will wipe the hard disk, NVRAM, and SMC just to be safe."
249,Product was faulty. The charging port wouldn't hold the plug. I returned it. I don't think the refurbishing process is very competent.
250,"This is exactly like the MacBook I was given for work that was stolen on a plane flight. No problems with this as a replacement so far, smooth sailing for 3 months already! I got the protection plan just in case, but I'm very satisfied with this cheaper than new replacement. Will update if there are any issues that arise. Would recommend."
251,"Idk what I was thinking not having an apple in the first place. This laptop is very easy to use, fast, and I’m excited to see how productive I can be with this format. I feel free, nothing holding me back now!! Unlike old pc with unresponsive interface, slow speeds, and constant crashes, this one gives me no problems!!"
252,This laptop was literally like brand new out of the box. So far my daughter is so thrilled with her graduation gift. She is ready for college now!!!
253,"Our first ever Mac but so far its been quite impressive. It was easy to setup and get it going. It works well and very easy to use, turn on/off, carry around and day to day life. Wish the battery would last a bit longer."
254,"BUYER BEWARE!I knew by choosing a refurbished computer, I was taking a risk, but I never expected this. When I received this MacBook Air, I was surprised it was the model Apple stopped making in 2017, since the title said “Newest Version.” I emailed the seller and they said Amazon forced that in the title and told me I could return it. I work full time, am in grad school, and have three kids. I figured with it being an Apple it would last long enough to get me through school, so I kept it. Now, six months later the screen won’t turn on. It’s completely black.I am able to connect to an external monitor and use the computer that way, so I know it’s the display. After trying to adjust the brightness, several resets, resetting the SMC and the PRAM, I called Apple Support. They ruled out all software issues and told me it had to be the hardware.At this point I contacted the seller and they basically told me “sorry, it’s outside of the 90 day window so there’s nothing we will do for you.” I have escalated to Amazon trying to get some kind of resolution. They just confirmed there is nothing they are willing to do for me. They also are not doing anything to penalize the seller, All Out Apple. I'm shocked at Amazon. Shady sellers like All Out Apple will always be around, but I really thought Amazon was better than Ebay in that way. Lesson Learned.There is no reason a MacBook Air should have a display of a completely stops functioning after six months of use, even refurbished. I’m grateful that I had a work-provided monitor I can plug into to do my schoolwork, but if I was aiming to be tethered to my desk, I would have bought a Mac Mini."
255,"Got the computer two days early! this was probably the fastest delivery I've ever received from amazon. I wasn't going to buy refurbished but I really wanted another MacBook and shelling out $2k for a new one was simply out of the question. When I saw the price for this MacBook Air, I decided to roll the dice and buy it. I knew it could possibly come not as advertised, such as having scratches or not being updated as far as software is concerned but when I opened it up it was practically BRAND NEW! set up was simple as can be! only took me 5 minutes to sign in with my Apple ID and all my information was synced between my iPhone and iPad and onto the MacBook Air. There were a few minor scratches less than a couple centimeters on the bottom of the computer nothing that noticeable. the charger doesn't stick as well as I'd like and one of the hinges is half broken off but I've that same issue with practically every MacBook I've ever had. I was really surprised with the quality. it said 2017 version but with all the updates and new iterations its hard to gauge which MacBook your getting I thought I was purchasing a much older MacBook Air than what I got this thing is amazing and the 13 in screen is far larger than I expected it to be feels like a 15 or 17 in display when having it in your hands/ the computer itself is incredibly light, the main reason I chose the air you can carry it in anywhere with one hand and hardly feel it definitely much lighter than my 2020 iPad 11"" All in all if you're on a budget, this computer is the way to go! for $400 its practically brand new and runs like a dream! thanks amazon for this incredible refurbished Mac! love it !"
256,"I don’t what to think I bought 2017 16gb 256 ssd but I received a refurbished 2019 8g 256 perfectly packaged, I can’t put apple care I already call for that but im not sure to keep it because I want a computer of 16of ram but this one is 2019, im gonna give the chance to see how it works, And it cost me the same price of a refurbished 2019 Of apple but those ones you can put apple care"
257,"hola, soy de peru. Estoy contento con la compra, la compre por el precio, y me llego tal cual las especificaciones.(late2018,2.3gz,8ram,256ssd). la bateria llego con 350 ciclos aproxen cuanto a lo estetico, tenia pequeños arañones en un costado, pero nada grave, la pantalla intacta y el touchbar ok. el cargador sellado oem.califico la compra como 9/10."
258,Got a few months out of this before the screen started disappearing intermittently. Then it wasn't so intermittent. I'd have much rather spent the extra money to get a new computer that didn't break than to buy something second-hand and have to decide to repair or replace.
259,"Considering I was 100% ripped off, I would not recommend you purchase from this seller, I did not receive what I wanted, the serial number for a COMPUTER comes up as an iPhone 11... Just.. No."
260,This computer was working fine and all of a sudden the screen went out.  Cost me $640 to fix it.
261,"Delivery was super fast, considering I’m in South Africa. The laptop is simply beautiful, woks well, no complaints, I love it."
262,"Positivo, EXCELENTE EQUIPO!!!"
263,So far this was a steal. Great product for a great value.
264,super machine
265,The space key and some of the keys were not working As they are supposed to. Really sticky
266,"Arrived, boxed well with balloon cushions. Power adapter looked clean but had scratches. Opened up the Lid of the MacBookPro and it looked like it had some sort of disease or cancer & it smelled quite strange too. It had over 50% battery so I carried on with a reset which resulted in an error. Luckily it booted back into Yosemite OS that it had installed years ago, after 3 failed attempts managed to update to Mojave. Of course first things first copy music etc onto, USB stick struggled to go in either of the USB Ports (look at the photos) was also stuck after insertion but managed to pull out, with a hard pull - full force - anger. Had a look into the ports and discovered they were literally rusted dirty like disgusting, this is not the definition of Refurbished - but 2nd Hand or Heavily Used. Be aware, set your expectations right in oder to avoid any disappointments."
267,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I was super stoked upon arrival, began setting up the laptop and within minutes the screen stopped working. Literally pixels. Severely disappointed. I have gotten ahold of kanga and they are working to replace the device but it has now been over a week since I’ve purchased the unit with two day shipping and still have nothing to show for it. I hope they come through on their end and send me a functional unit."
268,"I've only had it for about a week now and this 2015 MacBook Pro is working phenomenally! I was kinda hesitant buying a refurbished MacBook from Amazon, but I can honestly say I'm go glad I went ahead and did. It came extremely fast and right from opening the box, it was as if I had bought a brand new one right from Apple themselves. There's not a scratch, dent, stain, dust or anything on it. So far it's working extremely well and I will definitely buy form this seller in the future and recommend them to others as well! Great price for a great computer."
269,"I’ve had this MacBook Pro going on 4 days and so far so good! It has met all my expectations and more. I grew up using windows PCs. This is my first Apple computer and I’m happy to have made the transition. Wish I did this long time ago but better late then never. If it wasn’t for the packaging and not being in the original box, I probably wouldn’t be able to tell this was refurbished. This is just based from my experience using MacBooks at the Apple store. Also, there was a few minor scratches on the bottom of the laptop.I will revise and change review in a month if any problems. But as of now, my review above is how I feel."
270,"I've only had it for a couple days, but so far this is a great purchase. The thing looks brand new, and I know it isn't. I am replacing an older Mac and just can't afford the prices of new machines from Apple. Using Migration Assistant (an app that comes with Macs) I was able to restore a time machine backup from the old machine, so I've lost nothing in the transition."
271,"When I ordered this product for the first time, it came with a green line on the screen. I contacted the costumer service, they responded very quickly and replaced it.The second computer came with better specs, I was the happiest person... for 2 months though, the computer suddenly stop responding.Other things that are worth saying:- The charger is generic. A generic charger can easily damage the battery of the computer, that could explain my problem.- The second computer they sent, had a sticker that covered the whole low part of the computer (those stickers that are the same color as the computer and are used to cover up very big scratches.Conclusion: they can deliver a great costumer service, but not a working product."
272,"The macbook pro only worked for a short while. It had a charging/powering problem - wouldn't keep a charge at first, then wouldn't power on even when plugged in. Confirmed it was not a charger issue.I contacted the company who said to send it back for repair. Once they received it they wrote saying it cannot be fixed and charged me a ""restocking fee"" in the amount of the purchase of the laptop. Outrageous!! I even had a protection plan for it. After numerous interactions they refused to help and returned the laptop without telling me. THEN they said they couldn't do anything in terms of a refund because I had the machine. Months later they refuse to resolve it and amazon can't help me because it's a third party seller. An ABSOLUTE JOKE of a company. I'm out over $500.00 with a computer that can't be fixed - and Apple store said they could try but for more than the computer's worth. So yeah. They have my money and I have nothing.DO NOT BUY from these people if you'd like to keep your money."
273,"Hey all! So I’ve gotten into photography lately and needed a upgrade from my old 2012 MacBook Pro and 2011 Asus laptops for editing. Figured a 2015 model would be the way to go for a decent upgrade without spending tons of money. I was super skeptical about buying a reconditioned one through Amazon after reading the reviews and thought about it for about 4 hours before I made the transaction. Next day it was at my door step with me a bit nervous about opening the package and seeing a beat up MacBook, I opened the box and the MacBook was in a bubble wrapped sleeve and that’s it. Okay I’m fine with that but what was the condition of it? Looks like it barely got used or the previous owner always had a case on it. Outside from a few nicks here and there it’s flawless. Turns on and is super quick, the Retina display is beautiful and definitely enjoyable to watch movies. It came with Mojave so the first thing I did was update it to Big Sur and it’s still flawless. I’ve only had it for a day if that but so far I’m happy with my purchase. Just be mindful yours may or may not be like mine condition wise I got lucky. Should you buy one of these? I would I’m pleased with my purchase and I’m sure you would be too. But I’ll update with any issues if they come up in the future. Thankfully I’m a bit tech savvy so whatever happens I’m sure I can fix it."
274,"This of course this is an old model and reconditioned/renewed, so I was expecting it to look somewhat used; however, this MacBook Pro is in PERFECT CONDITION as if I had purchased it new. I'm upgrading from a very heavy and slow 2009 white MacBook that's a dinosaur and I could only do very basic things on it. It has almost zero capability in terms of battery life (it could only be used plugged in) so this laptop is an absolute gem in comparison. This might be why I'm so hyped and elated. Plus the price was very good. *I hope the computer doesn't have some sudden glitch and dies on me...lol!Now, I can finally edit my videos in iMovie, which was not working on the old MacBook, because I couldn't update it anymore. I need this laptop mainly for traveling, to do editing work, I have a 2 monitor PC set-up at home. My only wish is that I could transfer my Adobe CS to the new laptop.SIDE NOTE: it's actually overall a little smaller than my old 13"" (screen size is the same), it's not as heavy, but not as light as the Air; it arrived with Catalina iOS installed and I had to upgrade to Monterey to use the newest version of iMovie - this isn't a complaint, just an observation."
275,"I bought for my mom, great deal (sort-of), works great (after I deleted 2 mysterious old unknown wifi connections)I bought this for my mom, she was always having Windows problems, viruses disguised as virus removal, scammy pop-ups, and so on.  Happy day!  :DThey raised prices during Prime Day, wth?  I thought I was getting a good deal, but afterward I noticed the price went down.  Anyway, I ordered this for my mom.  She's been using Windows and I wanted her to experience a Macbook Pro.  This one is actually even better than mine!  I'm still happily using a Late 2013 2.4 Ghz 8 RAM 256 GB 13-inch Retina, her's is exactly the same except it's a Early 2015 and it's actually got 2.7 Ghz!  Anyway she seems really happy with it.  I set it up for her, and ran the serial number, which was not found, not surprisingly although I'm not sure what that means, and the update page in the App Store looks like it was coded in 1995, so I'm not sure what's up with that.  Could be something funky going on, but all I know is it works and we're happy with it.  She's getting used to using it, and she says it's fast and smooth.  She was getting tired of all the Windows updates and virus stuff and all the spammy popups telling her to purchase a virus disguised as virus removal, yadda yadda yadda, so I am well-pleased that she is now almost a full-blown Mac-head.  Thanks Apple.  I hope to be able to afford an Apple car when they do come out, haha.  I'm not sure about the battery-life yet, but I HAD TO replace the battery on mine, so replacing it on hers should not be a problem."
276,It’s just one continuous problem after the other with this computer. It’s really not worth it to save a little bit of money just buy new not refurbished have your warrantee you’re better off in the long run.
277,For this being my first ever Mac- This was an amazing buy... no scratches or dents. Its basically BRAND NEW. 😝😝😝The only thing is that it says 512gb but the space says 256gb so be wary of that.But other than that I am really happy with my purchase.
278,Good
279,Love it
280,"the product arrived with the screen broken. I would like a refund of $ 400 to repair it, since he is now in Brazil."
281,So happy with this purchase. Even my kids said it looks like the new ones. Has some minor imperfections but at the cost totally acceptable. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.
282,"I purchased through amazon this m1 chip 512 gb 8ram macbook pro 2020 year manufacture.  I’m a mac user of many years.  The computer is blazing fast, slim, light with great battery life. A huge bonus—-little need for additional  anti virus add on software since the macbook anti virus platform is very solid. A hidden gem when you buy any apple device is phenomenal tech telephone support.  The advisors at the apple stores and by telephone are the best part of the apple experience for me and even rival the devices they sell. Yes, I hate the high prices and know the game but over time I’ve  accepted their price points because of the incredible tech support."
283,battery would not take any charge  stuck at 1%
284,"I cannot believe the condition my Macbook is in, you can’t even tell if it’s used and the packaging was very nice and professional with the white box and wrapped just like it is when you get it directly from Apple. I am super happy with my purchase, thanks Amazon."
285,"Good, but it is a little small.. easy to control. Recommend if you are hard to control your computer"
286,Computer will not charge.
287,"""Refurbished"" even though Battery life was non existent from the startup, always check the reviews on laptops to make sure they have over 200, cause then you won't be played by greedy ass people like I was"
288,"Minor scratches , for the price reduction is a great buy !!!"
289,Light weight
290,"El producto reacibdiocionado en muy buen estado, funciona perfectamente y venía totalmente protegido y embalado. Muy satisfecho con la compra"
291,"Looks and acts brand new. Everything exactly as advertised. Will update if I have any issues but after a week I can say, I am pleasantly surprised!"
292,"If you've been waiting for Apple to wake up and address the concerns raised by the Apple community -- your wait is now over. This is the MacBook Pro we've all been wanting for years. This review is for the higher end model, stock.The good.- Keyboard. It's fantastic. The key travel has been extended to 1mm, which is about half of the original keyboard found on the 2015 and prior model years. It feels just as good to type on because apple improved the tactile feedback. The keys sort of spring back. The keyboard is quiet and very comfortable to type on. The keys are slightly smaller but do not make typing on them any more difficult. The directional arrows are now properly setup and the physical Esc key is back, making it a breeze to flip through open applications.- Screen. The difference in size is subtle but noticeable. It's technically even more dense, but just barely. You won't notice much difference from recent MacBook Pros but true to Apple, the display is absolutely gorgeous. The 0.6 inch difference in size retains the same logical resolution, so everything should look just slightly bigger which I welcome.- Processor. The base model has the same chipset as the 2019 15.4"" model. The performance, however, is about 10% better due to significantly improved airflow and larger heatsinks. The issue of heat related throttling has been largely addressed. On the upper model, the machine now comes with 8 cores and serious performance bump. There is literally nothing you can throw at this MacBook that it won't handle with breeze.- Graphics. The traditional setup is still here. You have the onboard Intel chipset, which operates when the demand for visual performance is low. You also have a discrete AMD chip which delivers significant improvement over the previous generation. In fact, the base model delivers performance in excess of the upper spec Vega chipset from last year. The leap is extraordinary. As before, the system will automatically choose which graphics card to use depending on demand.- Sound. In one world, amazing. Imagine Apple took a HomePod and flattened it to fit it in the housing of the MacBook Pro. That is essentially the experience. Bass is pronounced and crisp and treble is sharp. The sound is rich and room-filling. There are six speakers instead of two in the last generation.-Microphone. Major improvements with three mics instead of one in the previous generation. I use the MacBook to make calls using an iPhone and the sound on the other end is clear and free from background noice. I've been told it sounds a lot better than before, but that is of course subjective. On paper, you're getting better noise reduction and improved sound fidelity.- Touch Bar. Controversial in the past, I think it may now be the ""happy medium"" between physical keys and the useful Touch Bar which adapts to the content on the screen. The Esc key is back and on the right hand side you'll find Touch ID and power button.- SSD. You'll love the fact that now base starting size of the SSD has been doubled on both the entry model and the upper model with 512GB and 1TB respectively.- Gaming. This has to be mentioned. The graphics card offers incredible leap in performance. Modern games that would get 14-16FPS on high setting now perform at 35-40FPS with ease. Same settings. Same games. Huge improvement. It's now possible to play AAA games on the MacBook Pro with reasonable performance and high visual settings.- Productivity. This machine is a beast. I use the full Affinity suite and do some limited video editing. In addition, I have multiple productivity programs open, over a dozen Safari tabs, two email clients, and dozens of other apps, such as CRM, task managers, notes, etc. Everything runs smoothly.- Value. Yes, value. This expensive laptop brings the best value in the lineup of the 15.""4 (now 16"") offering to date. If you carefully look at the costs of truly compatible Windows offerings, you'll find the MacBook Pro to be competitively priced.The Bad- Weight. The machine is slightly heavier but I welcome the added bulky. Finally Apple went with functionality over its obsession with thiner and lighter hardware, giving us a machine with proper thermal management, proper keyboard and more. But if you plan on taking it with you places, you'll feel the extra bulk.- BTO Updates. The cost of BTO options is still quite high, with the noted exception of the 8GB option on the GPU. You're still paying a significant premium for each incremental upgrade over the base model.To sum up -- This is the best MacBook Pro in many years. It's a well-rounded, powerful machine that brings about incredible performance and value. I would highly recommend it to any Pro.If you're upgrading from the 13"" model and wonder how much more real estate you can expect, see attached side-by-side comparison photo.Update 3/15/20 -- Absolutely a beast of a machine. I love it. It has been pretty much perfect and its performance continues to surprise me. I have the top-speced model and it smokes pretty much everything I've used to date. In fact, it will perform on par with the new Mac Pro base configuration. Don't believe me? Google it. This is by far the best MacBook Pro to date and an amazing value. Well worth the price of admission if you need it."
293,"The performance differences between it and it's predecessor are marginal, at best ...Yet you are being asked to pay $2400 for membership. Think back to around 2015, when the previous gen entry cost was still $ 2000, then they changed it to $2400. For that, you got shafted with a crap keyboard, a failing display, an identity crisis for a touch-bar, and less connectivity.Now that this latest model came out and people are buying it, they are bolstering Apple's position: never apologize for hardware issues, make ppl pay extra for AppleCare+, give folks a real working keyboard and make it look like they are doing you a favor so the prices are .... what .... justified ?Apple's pricing schemes make you wonder if they think they can get ppl to believe that hardware is actually comparable to a commodity, or something like that.Lastly, you do not know what kind of quality issues lurk behind these new models ...."
294,"So disappointed.....As soon as I added Lightroom and started process photos, the laptop began to ""click"" during the processing phase! Obviously this isn't normal; currently in the process of returning :("
295,"Maybe I just got unlucky, but the laptop I received never really worked.  When going through the setup process, the computer was unable to load data from my Time Machine backup.  I cancelled out of it in an attempt to complete the rest of the installation process.  I had to shutdown and after that,  the machine never worked again.  During the boot phase it just cycled through the Apple logo/progress bar startup over and over and over again.  It would almost reach the end and then stop and restart, but never fully booted.  I returned it, but since it was processed through a third party, I had to pay a 15% restocking fee, so I only received 85% of what I initially paid.  So I had to pay almost $400 for the pleasure of owning a broken Mac for a day.  What a joy!  I complained to the 3rd party and they said the laptop was fine which is baffling since I watched the machine try and boot for half and hour.  I feel screwed.  Maybe I just got a bad product, or maybe Apple has serious quality control issues.  It's seriously making me think of giving up on Macs all together."
296,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   its hardly been a week i bought the MacBook Pro 16"".and i am already facing trouble.whenever i play a video there is a green screen flash coming.i have no clue whats going on.i did not even install any major applications on the laptop too.This is ridiculous."
297,Battery life is supposed to run up to 11 hours yet mine dies at around 1-2. I've been on it right now for about 20 minutes and the battery has dropped about 15%. My laptop also begins to get really hot after using it for a while and I can hear the fans running at their maximum. I'm not sure what the issue is since the sellers are selling authentic apple products. I will be returning and just purchasing from apple.
298,"I have owned the 15.4 Touch Bar model since 2016, I typed on it before I bought it and I knew the keyboard wasn't as good as my 2012 15"", but, it wasn't as bad as some reviewers made it out to be, I'm glad I bought it before the bad reviews. The 2016 was a huge upgrade from the 2012 and I can say the 2019 is a huge upgrade from the 2016.There is no one feature that is absolutely night and day from the 2016, but, every function is better.  Screen quality and size, performance, keyboard (mostly non-touchbar ESC key for me), battery life, speakers, mic and thermal, it's a bit quieter than the 2016. If you have been holding out because you like the 2012 keyboard travel and feel, the 2019 travels further and feels better.I can't personally feel the weight difference in my bag, between laptop, accessories (Jabra speaker being the heaviest) my bag weighs about 9lbs so if it's 9.3lbs I can't feel it and once it's out of the bad I don't tend to move it around. It is a big larger, but, still fits in my small 2 pocket Tumi laptop bag, so the .25"" doesn't bother me either.I'm looking forward to seeing if it's as durable, I got over 300 full battery cycles on the 2016, I expect the same from this unit, but, only time will tell.Hope my experience helps."
299,"Yes, this  gorgeous machine that's fits my needs exactly DID drop dead just now, after running well for weeks. I've read that Apple installs a ""drop dead"" chip in its machines, but I never thought they got the timing as precise as this. Well done, Apple.But now I'm out my 2000 bucks (PLUS) and I have a dead box sitting on my work desk. This is not good, not even for a laugh.I CANNOT contact the seller either. Maybe they all died from the virus, or SOME virus. PLEASE, good folks at Apple and Amazon,  help me!Thank y'all."
300,"OMG!!! This is my 3rd MacBook Pro that I have owned over the past few years, and I have to say this one is by far the best one yet. This is my first Space gray, and I it's absolutely gorgeous and sleek. A very sexy machine. It looks so much better than the silver. A more modern look.The screen is freaking GORGEOUS! The colors, the brightness, so pure and crystal clear. And me being an animator, graphics designer and writer, I can tell the larger screen for sure.My last MacBook Pro was the 15 inch 2015, and I thought I was going to miss the glowing Apple logo, but to be honest, I don't. When I go back on my 2015, it seems so outdated. The mirrored logo looks so much more modern.The trackpad is HUGE, and I love it. My 2015 track pad seems so tiny and disappointing now.I have no idea why so many people say they hate the Touch Bar. I LOVE IT! I can not imagine life without it. It's beautiful and as a writer I love how it recommended the corrected words. I love being able to run through videos, play music and navigate more effectively. It's perfect. Well....almost. The only complaint I would say is it goes dim in dim light. I thing it should be our decision to dim it. Other than that it's perfect. I also love how easy it is to get to the emojis. 😊The Keyboard....OMG! I love it. It's so much better than the 2015. I can type so fast on this thing. It's AMAZING. I also love the backlight. It's so bright in a dark room and it doesn't bleed out like the 2015.And lastly. I LOVE how powerful this beautiful beast is. I can created my animations with no struggle. And it renders at lightening speed which means my fans of my Youtube Channel will get faster animated horror stories from me.If you are caught on the fence if you should buy it. Get off that fence right now, and BUY IT! IT'S 100% PURE PERFECTION!!!! Thank you so much, Apple. Windows users are soooo missing out!👍"
301,Fantastic
302,"This is an unusually large advance over previous models, especially in raw computing power, but also in fun things like screen and headphone support.This Amazon listing has two different processors, the M1 Pro (listed as 16-Core GPU ""style"") and the M1 Max (32-Core GPU). I'll call one the Pro, the other the Max. I got the base Pro, but much of what I'll say applies to both, and I'll have some comments specifically about the Max too. (MBP below = MacBook Pro.)Amazon doesn't offer most of the options you can get, only the ones listed. For now (and probably later), that's the Pro with 16GB RAM and 512GB or 1TB SSD, or the Max with 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD. 3 versions total.Screen Brightness* and HappinessThis screen can get up to 1600 nits brightness and can sustain full-screen brightness up to 1000. That's very impressive, as MBPs since 2016 have topped out at 500.*But the vast majority of the time, this screen will also top out at 500, because those other numbers are only for HDR (high dynamic range, what Apple calls XDR), i.e. some videos and some photos viewed in some programs. If you're browsing the internet, using productivity apps, or the like, those are almost all SDR (standard dynamic range). You'll be seeing them at the same brightness as with MBPs for the last five years.That said, the new screen is beautiful and bright in both HDR and SDR for most situations. For HDR, it puts out more color and brightness, and darker blacks - a million-to-one contrast ratio - with a wider range of light and color that has more pop and more detail in shadows and highlights. It can be dazzling or just more realistic.For SDR, it's much like before, still a gorgeous screen, with better contrast than before because of darker blacks.Has more pixels per inch (254, up from 226), and more pixels all over (3456 by 2234, up from 3072 by 1920). The aspect ratio remains 16:10 (not counting the top menu bar).ProMotionProMotion is Apple's name for screen refresh rates that can go up to 120Hz, or lower to save processor/battery power when 120 isn't needed. This makes motion smoother, more natural.For now where ProMotion applies is limited. Most scrolling in browsing, including with Safari, still tops out at 60Hz. Which is fine for me, but it bothers some people, looks choppy to them. This could be changed with a software update.Bloom and GhostsBloom is when a bright spot on a dark background bleeds out past where it's supposed to be, a common issue with this kind of screen. I and most others think this screen handles it well (better than the iPad Pro), but it can still arise some.Ghosting is when a moving object leaves a noticeable trail of ghost images behind for a fraction of a second, one for each new frame until the old image fades. MBPs are notoriously mediocre at this kind of ghostbusting, and this screen is no exception. Expect the usual haunting, if you notice that kind of thing.PWMFor those concerned (you mostly know who you are), there is PWM (pulse-width modulation) on the smaller 14"" version of this screen, and so very likely on this one too, at a frequency of 14,880Hz at all brightness levels (measured by NotebookCheck). That's a very high frequency, considered well beyond what would cause trouble for the susceptible.The NotchAs you can see in the main photo here, there's a black Notch at the top of the screen. There are no pixels there. The long-desired improved camera is there, and a mic array and light sensor (and maybe room for a Face ID system if they decide to make MBPs with that). As with the iPhone Notch, it's controversial.You can make the Notch disappear, or rather blend in, if you make the background up there black. It also disappears into the black bars when you view things like videos in full-screen mode.The cursor disappears into the Notch if you put it there. If an app has menu items that stretch there, they disappear too, but they'll still function normally if you put the (invisible) cursor on them.Desperate times call for desperate measures. Most apps won't have this trouble, but if you must, you can avoid menu items disappearing by using the ""Scale to fit"" function, which shrinks the entire screen work area a little to fit below the Notch. Makes it look like an old 15"" if the background is black, like there are wide black bezels. (Google ""Scale to fit below built-in camera"" for full instructions and mockery.)There are also third-party apps, such as Bartender, to manage how items appear in the menu bar and keep them visible.Camera and MicsThe new camera that, along with the thinner bezels, makes the Notch necessary, is 1080p, with an f/2 lens for good exposure in the shadows. Video looks noticeably better than before, though it can have a processed look.The three mics sound very clean and natural but with a little less bass than before to my ears, which is fine.Extra ScreensYou can use two external monitors with the Pro, down from four with previous models. They can be up to 6K @60Hz with a billion colors. The Max can still use four: three 6K and one 4K, all @60Hz etc.You can use 4K @120/144Hz HDR monitors too.You can run two from one port if you use the right kind of dock or daisy-chain.Headphone OomphThe new headphone jack has more power for high-impedance headphones. It automatically adjusts, so it won't overwhelm low-impedance phones. If the headphones have less than 150 ohms impedance, they get 1.25 volts RMS. If more, 3 volts. That might cause it to fail to provide enough power to some not-so-high-impedance headphones that still require extra power, such as planars.With my 2016 15"" MBP, I've had to use a portable amp for my Beyerdynamic DT 1990 Pros (250 ohm), but now I can pretty well do without it, though sometimes only just. The volume on some sources is still not always what I wish I could make it. But now I can nearly achieve hearing loss with the intro to the guitar riff in ""Money for Nothing."" Which also sounds good, and healthier, a couple notches down.Among other headphones that have tested favorably with the new jack are the DT 990 Pros (250 ohm), and the Sennheiser HD650, 660S, 6XX, and HD800 (150 to 300 ohm).One report says the planar Hifiman HE4XXs (35 ohm planar) sound good, but most planars tested are said to need more power. The Audeze LCD-2Cs are reported to sound good enough, though not their best. The LCD-3s and Hifiman Sundaras and Aryas are said to be underpowered.For my usual regular-impedance phones, Cleer Flow IIs (16 ohm), the wired volume is a little louder than before, though still not always the earsplitting barrage I want for some sources. Maybe for the best.Quality iems (in-ear monitors) that require especially clean input, but not too much, reportedly sound good, including Andromedas and Moondrop Starfields.SpeakersThey're improved from the already laptop-leading speakers from earlier MBPs, with a fuller sound and decent kick, amazingly good for when nothing with a 3"" woofer is around.Apple mysteriously says the 14"" M1 has the same speaker system, but looking inside both machines shows the speakers in the 16"" are bigger - both ""subs"" and tweeters - and located differently, with the subs in the front corners on this one. The 16"" has fuller bass (such as it is).Heat and NoiseThere isn't any.None with my typical use, at least. If you push it hard, it can get warm, but not as hot as my 2016 15"". Which makes sense, as this has a larger enclosure, bigger fans, larger, better heat sinks, and more power-efficient processors. The fans don't have to spin up as much to do the same amount of cooling, so it's noticeably quieter even when it does heat up, rarely makes any noise at all.The 16"" Max comes with a larger heat sink than the 16"" Pro, so likely runs a little cooler and quieter sometimes, though the Max might get hotter when it uses a lot of that extra power.KeyboardVery quiet, much like the older Mac laptop keyboards, not the butterfly ones from 2015-19, but the rest. Maybe less travel in the keys than some of those, but plenty for me.I miss the touch bar sliders for fine control of some functions, but you can still use sliders via the Control Center, the icon next to the date on the screen's top menu bar. That's also where control of the keyboard backlight is, no more control for it on the keyboard.TouchpadThe best available by far, responsive and large so you can carry the cursor over a large area with more control. For clicks, it's great. For taps, which I turn off, it's not as great, according to those who prefer that - appears to be a software issue.PortsThere's one less Thunderbolt/USB-C port than before, but 50% more bandwidth (3 controllers instead of 2).The HDMI is 2.0, can drive up to 4K HDR @60Hz.The SD card reader is shallow, so the cards stick out. There might be room for a flush micro-SD adapter. I only have cards up to 64GB, which work fine. Some people have had trouble reading some cards, so it may be finicky.Battery LifeI usually keep plugged in, but the reviews I've seen that cover battery life tests typically say it's the longest of any similar machine they've tested, including PCs. Reports of battery life for office work, browsing, watching videos, and so on generally range from 10 to 16 hours, sometimes more. It can go unusually long with heavy use too, 5 hours or more of video work, for example. Max Tech did 10 benchmark and stress tests with it in a couple hours, some maxing out the CPU or GPU for up to ten minutes, and it still had 36% left.At normal settings, there's no performance hit until you get down to 3%; until then you can process or game at full tilt. There's a low-power mode that extends battery life by limiting performance, lowering screen brightness, etc. The Max also has a high-power mode, but it seems to only ramp up the fans sooner to help cooling. Apple's description and tests in reviews indicate it doesn't affect performance in any direct way.The Max has tended to have a little less battery life than the Pro in reviews. The only good tests I've seen that compared directly either found negligible differences or up to 15% less battery life for the Max. (Other tests haven't been well controlled.)You can quick charge to 50% in a half-hour. The new power brick is 45% more powerful than before, and maybe 30% larger lengthwise, still small for what it does. You can charge at lower speed with smaller bricks (not included) via the USB-C ports.Size and WeightIt's noticeably heavier than before, about 5 ounces over the previous 16"", and not quite as sleek, but it's sleeker than I was expecting from the photos.RepairabilityHa ha! But really, it's better than it was. Battery modules now have pull tabs so they can be more easily replaced. The screen can be replaced more easily, but if Apple doesn't do it you lose True Tone (which I don't want anyway). The headphone, Thunderbolt and MagSafe ports can be replaced without replacing the logic board. Now rates a 4/10 from iFixit for repairability, up from 1/10 for the previous model.CompatibilityComes with Rosetta 2, which enables M1 Macs to use programs written for Intel Macs, and usually works very well.There's no more Boot Camp, so to run Windows or Windows programs you have to use third-party software like Parallels, which runs Windows by emulating a Windows machine (and requires a Windows license), or Crossover, which modifies Windows programs to run on Macs.  Which works best, or at all, depends on the program.GamingWoW *mostly* runs 50 to 120fps at high settings and resolution, depending on the location. Some places can't even manage 50 at those settings, though, but do OK at more compromised settings. Baldur's Gate 3, Diablo III, CS:GO and several others can run at 60-100fps or better at good settings.You can play Windows games via Parallels or Crossover. They generally don't run as well, but some do fine.Most games, including native ones, run quite a bit better on the Max, with up to 2x the fps. Final Fantasy XIV is hit and miss at good settings even with the Max.Gaming isn't usually hot or noisy, can get warmer with light fans for the games that aren't running natively. And there's no noticeable performance hit for gaming on battery.WorkI have to mention the less fun part: how well this does things you might have to do at work. It does almost all of it better than before, much of it way better. Here's how it compares according to actual test results from numerous sources with Xcode, Logic Pro, Lightroom, Blender, Final Cut Pro, Premiere Pro, and so on. The range of comparison depends on what the task is.Previous base MBP 16"" (Intel i7 AMD 5300): The Pro is 60% to several times faster.Previous top-spec'd MBP (i9 5600M): The Pro is about the same to 2 or 3 times faster.Regular M1 machines (not M1 Pro or Max): The Pro is about the same to several times faster.The 14"" M1 Pro with same specs: The same, though the 16"" has the bigger battery and heat removal system, so it fares better in those ways.Windows laptop work stations: This is complicated, but the Pro can thrash most Windows laptops in most intensive work-related apps. It lines up very roughly with machines with a good i7/i9 and an RTX 3070, but generally can't keep up with the RTX 3080. The Pro uses a fraction of the power, and so only produces a fraction of the heat and noise, if any. And lasts and performs much better on battery.Pro vs MaxThe Max is about the same to twice as fast as the Pro, mostly between those extremes. The CPU is much the same, but the GPU is double the cores, so the main advantage is in graphics-heavy work.Besides the GPU cores, the Max has twice the bandwidth for memory transfer, two hardware video encode engines instead of one, and some extra cooling capacity.If you're already successfully using a Mac laptop, you don't *need* the Max, since the Pro is already better than what you have. But that doesn't mean you can't benefit from the Max's extra power if you have the money. For intensive video editing, massive photo editing, or better gaming (though cheaper Windows machines will play most games better), the Max has real advantages.To confuse things a little more, Apple (but not Amazon currently) also offers a demi-Max with a 24-core GPU, halfway between the Pro's 16 and the Max's 32. It's a cheaper way to get the extra bandwidth, video encoder, and cooling advantages of the Max. Tests show that in graphics-intensive tasks it operates roughly midway between the Pro and 32-core Max, often more than half, as expected.WarrantiesThis comes with a one-year limited warranty against manufacturing defects that includes free phone support for the first 90 days. If you want to also cover accidental damage (with deductibles) and extend the regular warranty and free tech support to 3 years, you can buy 

AppleCare+ from Amazon

   (link embedded) or Apple. You get 60 days from purchase to buy it, but coverage for accidents doesn't start until you do. (I always self-insure when I can, so I didn't get it.)DecalsLast and least, this comes with two black Apple decals, the sign of true professional Apple equipment."
303,Out of the box unusable for me. This MacBook Pro does not have any USB ports to be able to restore from a previous Mac back up that’s on an external drive. You must buy an adapter. Since I live in a remote area I’d have to order online and wait. You cannot even plug a iPhone12 Pro Max directly into it. The only ports it has are thunderbolt. So even Apple’s own lighting connector needs an adapter. The keyboard is a downgrade from the old keyboard. Solid black plastic instead of plastic keys surrounded by aluminum which were easier to see. Had to call Apple support to download an update because there is no reset option in the System Preferences of OS Monterey. And the update did not work to give it that option. Will have to figure out a different option to remove my account and information to return it. This particular MacBook is defective I believe.
304,I ordered the 2021 16 inch right away as I knew they would probably sell out fast. I had to make sure I had one for my trip I am leaving on soon.  As soon as I opened it the screen would never come on.  Thought maybe it needed charging so I tried that.  Still nothing but a black screen.  It kept making the sound when you open it up even when it was closed over and over again.  I took it to the local Apple Store hoping I could get some answers.  They tired to get it to work and could not either.  They said it is very strange and maybe something happened to it during shipping.  They said since it is brand new it would be best to get my money back from Amazon.  I thought maybe I could just exchange it before my trip but the one I ordered is out of stock.  I will try the 14 inch and see if I like it compared to the size of the 16 inch since it is in stock.  This is a first MacBook Pro I have ever purchased and now I am a bit nervous.
305,"Here are the temperature results for the new cool MacBooks compared to the old overheating intel ones. 91 degrees for the old one near the processor, and 74 degrees on the new ones. Both had been running for hours transferring files nonstop. Amazing. I have been editing video, transferring large files and not once have the fans kicked on. Makes me want to cry."
306,"Finally, this 2021 MacBook Pro cured my depression!"
307,Arrived DOA - wouldn’t start up. Spent hours on the phone with Apple support and still wouldn’t start. Returned - c’mon man!
308,"This laptop is unbelievably fast. Between the screen, battery life, and performance, this laptop is head and shoulders better than any competition."
309,My first ever MacBook. Switched over from PC and I can't believe I didn't switch sooner! On the pricer side but I'm super happy with my purchase!
310,"I have been using my MacBook Pro from 2014 for work until last week when I finally purchased this MacBook Pro. My old MacBook starts up and works as fast as the day I bought it. The only reason I bought a new MacBook was because the battery life was getting low. I probably could have just bought a new battery and it would have been fine.That being said, I did hold out for this MacBook because Apple brought back the ports that I needed. I use the HDMI and SD ports daily. An Ethernet port would have been nice but that’s asking too much. This MacBook has a 2 day battery life and is blazing fast. I use Adobe programs and this MacBook doesn’t even blink when I do live editing. Best laptop I have ever used.I own a business that uses many PC laptops and a couple MacBooks. A PC will never last as long as a MacBook. And, a PC ALWAYS gets slower after 6 months of use. The price is high but you can buy a new PC every 2 years or a MacBook every 7 years."
311,"Coming from a 2019 16in, I feel that this generation is 2 steps forwards, 1 step back.Pros:-Fans are never audible even under full extended load!  This was my #1 issue with my 2019 mac which would have constant fan noise with 2 monitors.-2x battery life-Better screen especially in dark environment or a dark subject-Extremely fast for certain workloads such as video editing and code compilation.-magsafe is back (although I personally don't care for it)-most apps work normally with rosetta emulation, but may have some stutter.Cons:-thicker and SIGNIFICANTLY heavier.-Screen has a notch which is very distracting for me.-Still has some compatibility issues.-Terrible for games.  Only a few titles are supported natively.  I only tested league of legends(uses rosetta emulator), but it was choppy and 1/3 the fps of my 2019 intel macbook.- +$300 base price even though they got rid of intel.-The area I feel apple has made a major misstep is with ports.  I couldn't care less for SD card or HDMI, but everyone who buys this is going to need USB-A.  It's ridiculous that I still have to bring a dongle everywhere just to use my mouse but these ports I never/rarely use are back.Also some developer related tools/libraries aren't working.C# debugger is totally unsupported for example.  Anything that requires gpu hardware acceleration (pytorch) is unlikely to ever be supported in any usable form.  Linux dual boot is unsupported or in early experimental stages.  I also had issues building/running java projects natively, but no issues with rosetta.If you're looking to buy this for an undergrad program, it's probably workable.  However, I'd suggest saving some $ and getting a used mac or windows machine.  Professional devs will be aware of their specific requirements, but I suspect many will need to keep a secondary x86 machine for the foreseeable future."
312,"I am writing this review focused primarily on people who are considering jumping from the 13"" MacBook Pro to the 14"" MacBook Pro, which is what I did. I moved from the 13"" MacBook Pro M1 with 16gb of RAM to the 14"" MacBook Pro M1 Pro with 16gb of RAM.Size: So, 1"" of screen might not seem like a lot on its face, but the difference is pretty substantial, in my opinion. Even the pictures don't quite do it justice. The screen feels considerably larger in a package that isn't considerably larger. For me, it's the perfect sweet spot for someone who wants something larger than the 13"" model, but smaller than the 16"". I had a 16"" MacBook Pro i9 and it was just too much for me. This one feels perfect.Form Factor: The new 14"" and 16"" MacBooks both adopt a thicker chassis, which is shown in the pictures. As such, Apple decided to make the casing flat instead of gently rounded. It honestly reminds me of the pre-unibody builds, but still sleek and modern. If I didn't know this one was new and you just laid them side-by-side, I might say that the old form factor looks a little newer, but that isn't to say that it looks bad.Aesthetics: Overall, I touched on the aesthetics a bit in the ""form factor"" section. It looks like a high-end laptop, but at the same time I can see some people thinking it looks dated. I personally like the flatter look over the more rounded look, but it will depend on the person. Another thing I like is moving the ""MacBook Pro"" branding from under the screen to the bottom of the casing. I just think it provides a cleaner look during use. The black background of the keyboard is also a plus for me. The old space gray background was fine, but I really like the black.Function: Most people probably won't notice a massive difference in the previous iteration and the new iteration. For the 14"" and 16"" MacBook Pros, the touchbar has been removed. This will make a lot of people happy. For me, I was always pretty ambivalent about the touchbar, but I'm not going to complain about a key row there. The keyboard appears to have ever so slightly more travel and bounce. It's not a huge amount, but it is noticeable. I'll touch on The Notch later.Performance: My 13"" had the M1 chip and now my 14"" as the M1 Pro. So far, I haven't noticed a tremendous difference when using programs like Logic Pro, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Lightroom, but I wouldn't say those are super intensive programs. If you're exporting massive 8K videos, you might want to jump up to the M1 Max. One thing I have noticed is that the thermals are maybe a little bit worse. Just a touch. I have noticed it warming up a bit, but the fan still has not come on once. I only mention this because my 13"" M1 stayed cold at all times. It's not as bad as my i9, which sounded like a jet engine revving up while it jumped well over 100 degrees, but it's something to be aware of.The Notch: Honestly, so much has been made of the notch and I think it's mostly overstated. Yes, it's fun to meme the fact that Apple still hasn't found a way around the notch, particularly on iPhones, but it's really not a huge deal. Were it up to me, I would have just left a bezel up there, but I can understand why Apple didn't. I use a Dell XPS for work and it has razor thin bezels with no notch, but at the same time the camera is an absolute joke. Looks like it's from 2002.The Notch (cont'd): The notch behavior can be inconsistent from app to app, but not to the point where it's bothersome. I have seen some programs with very large nav menus up top bump the status bar out of the way to make room. And while this particular phenomenon is not something new for MacBooks, losing a big chunk of that bar to the notch will likely make this a more regular occurrence for people. Do I wish it didn't have a notch? Yeah, probably. Does it hurt the experience? Very, very little.Screen: For everyday indoor use, which is almost exclusively what I do, I think you will be hard-pressed to find a better screen on the market. The 120Hz refresh rate is something I waited a long time to get on the iPhone, so I was pretty shocked to see it implemented on the new MacBook Pros just a month later. It actually has more pixels/inch than the iMac 27"" 5K screen, which I also use pretty regularly. All-in-all, the screen is just the best in the business.Overall: It's a great and powerful laptop for someone who is wanting a little more than web surfing and word processing. I use mine primarily for recording music, as well as live performances using standalone plugins, so I need something that is powerful and easy to use. The MacBook Pro has always fit the bill, but now with the M1, M1 Pro, and M1 Max chips, I have absolutely no concern for performance or consistency.My 13"" M1 did just what I needed in this regard, but I'm someone who wanted a slightly larger screen without drastically increasing my footprint and weight. The 14"" MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip is just what I needed. If you're someone who needs absolutely top notch performance, I'd recommend upgrading the RAM and going with the M1 Max."
313,"I haven't upgraded my computer for more than a decade, so it would stand to reason any recent releases would impress me, but this macbook pro has gone above and beyond in the small time I've had it.The screen is truly something to behold. Smooth, clear, just beautiful. I don't typically care about bezels, but I might start. The expanded screen makes an unexpected difference. Meanwhile, I barely notice the notch. Apple said they'd find workarounds to make it scarce, and they have.The speakers are wonderful as well. I was skeptical at first -- thought I caught some tinny effects on a couple songs, but the more I listen to them, the more I'm convinced the tinniness was in the recording (it was a live album, which might explain it). As for the spatial audio, I've only heard a couple songs, but it's pretty trippy. This is my first experience with it, and it doesn't disappoint.In the short time I've had the computer, it's been nothing but fast. Probably more computer than I need, so if you're a sound editor or photographer, this review probably isn't for you. But for those of you casual users who want a solid machine that will last (as I said, my last macbook pro made it more than a decade), this is the one. Excited as I was for my last macbook, I could see room for improvement at the time. Right now, I don't see how things get better than this."
314,"M1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. Compared to previous MacBook Pro, it's a giant leap ahead. These tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the Macbook. This particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro,  but it still kicks butt. You can get the Pro Max chip and bump up the RAM to 64GB if you want - and add tons more storage. The 14 inch MacBook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. It can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. The display is stunning. Just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. The brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. Real HDR viewing -  a big difference. You will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. After 10 minutes I don't even notice it. It means nothing for your experience. Its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. Camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous MacBooks. Six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. Music/movies it feels like surround sound. For video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. The keyboard is a dream to type on. Very solid like all MacBooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. The Apple Magic Keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. Battery life is amazing. I have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. At best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! Especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it won't be 17 hours but I did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. The power efficiency is ground breaking. They have added back the MagSafe power plug - which is great! And added back an SD card slot and and an HDMI port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. I wish it had at least one USB-A old style port - but it doesn't. You get three USB-C thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. They got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro MacBooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. Apparently they listened to a lot of users who didn't really like the touch pad. The shape and style of this laptop is great. Some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. That is BS. I have been typing most of the day and I don't feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. Very comfy for typing. Some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new Macbook Pro, but I am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside -  this is an amazing laptop - the best Apple has ever made, hands down. And I would say you won't find a better power laptop anywhere.  All that said - this is not a gamers machine. Apple is not for hard core gamers. I mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. I am a hard core gamer and a PC geek  - I have a powerful windows PC for gaming. And always will. But for everything else. this MacBook is king. I use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. I can plut into a giant monitor if I want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch IPS panel. So if you are wondering if this Macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - I am here to tell you, its the real deal. I finally upgraded from my 2015 MacBook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. If you are thinking of getting one - you won't be disappointed. One last comment. I am an old timer windows guy, and I know all the counter arguments for the Mac. Many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. First, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new M1 Pro chips - you can't. And aside from that, the Mac OS is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text FROM A PHOTO! Whaaat? And the design/ergonomics/quality of these MacBooks is unmatched. So, yes you pay more - but you get more. My last MacBook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. If you want this laptop - get it! It rocks."
315,"I have a Mabook Pro covered by Apple care. The computer needs a new battery. To make a long story short Apple left me for months with a computer, again under warranty, which I can use for a couple of hours for simple tasks like web browsing before it needs to be recharged. Apple refused to replace the battery because the diagnostic read 81% not below 80 % as per policy. In all this Apple didn’t have any problems asking me to invest countless hours of my time between doing clean installs trips to apple stores etc.. I feel a more respectful way to treat me as a loyal customer could have been let us replace the battery first and if that doesn’t fix the issue which I seriously doubt ask me to do troubleshooting. All this to save something that would probably cost you few $$. Seriously ?"
316,sent me base model
317,"I probably got a faulty laptop but the charger status doesn’t show it’s charging when plugged in, only thing indicating that it’s charging is the orange light. My chrome windows keeps crashing whenever I put the computer to sleep and the external video display rarely connects"
318,"I never write reviews, but feel compelled to write one for this Macbook Pro. I've owned macs consistently since 1990s and have dealt with eye strain on the air and now on this laptop. It gave me horrible headaches and eye strain even with a matte protector. I returned it and am now looking at PCs for the first time because if I can't read from the screen without it making me sick, I can't use it."
319,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   My first MacBook ever! I had been saving up for it before the official drop— & I was not disappointed! Love the Touch ID feature, and it’s so efficient! Can’t wait to use it when I go back to school!"
320,"This laptop has a superior display, superior speakers, superior camera and an excellent keyboard. Don't go cheap and buy the ""affordable"" MacBook Air base model like some of these talking heads have been advising. It's not a good buy if you are unhappy with it after six months, and believe me, you will be unhappy with 8 GB of RAM and two USB ports after six months. M1 MacBooks are not upgradeable so if you find that you need more RAM, you are stuck. Unless all you are doing sending emails, tweets, and watching TicTok, you will probably need something more, especially if you are using your laptop for work. I'm using my MacBook Pro with an LG UltraFine 5K 27 inch display as my desktop system, which replaces a 27 inch iMac. I'm very happy."

   Sheeeese! What can I say? Apple has done it again 🤪😍 magnificent piece of device I must say."
322,"I pulled the trigger on this thing hoping that the bad reviews were wrong.. some of the comments saying it came dirty and defective definitely gave me pause however, what arrived today was practically a brand new macbook. the device does not show any signs of wear and the battery cycle count is 18, it came with the original power brick and while the cable was used, it was not worn or dirty in any way. While i've only just started using the device about an hour ago, I can tell you that it's speedy and works flawlessly... had I not known it was a refurb when buying it, I would have easily confused it for a brand new mbp.. for those asking, this is a 2017 macbook pro and the specs as quoted are accurate. i'll play around with this thing for a little while and update this review as needed, but so far this looks like a winner!***update***A few months in and it’s still working flawlessly. I don’t regret my purchase for one second, and neither should you!"
323,This is not a 256GB MacBook Pro- they are falsely advertising it as such and then shipping buyers 128GB versions.
324,"Came in used and dirty, and it was not even turn off, I'm gonna return it. So disappointed."
325,"Wow. I cant say enough how happy I am with this laptop! I it arrived early, and for a refurbished computer I swear it doesn't have a scratch, dent, smudge or single flaw anywhere on it! Its fast, the battery is great, its working perfectly! I couldn't be happier with this thing!"
326,"Was excited to receive it and on the outside it had one noticable chip in the case on the cover side (which had a sharp edge to it), but thought that isn't too bad.  But when opening it up the screen in both the top left and top right were broken/chipped/cracked like it had been dropped and they replaced the cover, but not the screen.  This was not acceptable.  Wanted to try it out and ended up learning that some of the keys did not work right (sticky, pushed strange and such), plus the touchpad/mouse was really strange and didn't seem to work correctly.  Too many issues out of the box for me and too concerned that there might be other issues from where it looked to have been dropped and such.  Sending it back and just started that process.  So far the return seems ok....but just hate that the product does not match the description...using their words ""Renewed products work and look like new""."
327,"I ordered the space gray with 256 gb of ram and received a silver with 128gb.  I knew this could happen as the picture did not match the description and I had seen other similar reviews.The good news is it was on time and in flawless condition.  I think I will stick with it and not press my luck, as it is still a fair price and a great machine, but beware."
328,"I have to admit, I don't typically write reviews and I was a little hesistant about the product due to some 1 to two star reviews. The space gray model not only is at a great price, it came to me brand new. With all the specs I was expecting, i5 8GB RAM 256GB SSD, and works like a dream. Battery life is great, setting up was easy, and all my Apple Products (iPhone, Apple watch, Earpods) synced with no issues. I'm not sure as to why there were so many negative reviews, but mine is not one of them. SO HAPPY!! I truly recommend."
329,the battery is dead
330,"This product arrived quickly and looked great.  There have been multiple glitches with the power switch and with the screen ever since it's arrival.  Most of the time the power button would require multiple attempts to push before the computer would power up.  When the computer woke from sleep state (opening lid after its been closed for at least fifteen minutes) the screen would be black and then all pixelated.  Most recently, the computer wouldn't even turn on, when it finally did, it was all reset and all the settings were reset.  I lost everything I had put on the computer over the past day.  The seller still hasn't gotten back to me after email and I left a voice message.  I have now initiated a return as I want my money back.  It would have been nice if they had gotten back to me ASAP when I emailed or when I called (during normal hours of operation, by the way) and it went to voicemail.  The fact that they didn't and the computer kept coming up with other issues.  I now will buy a new one.  The value is not there with the aggravation generated."
331,"Multiple reviews mentioned getting devices with used batteries, screen issues, etc.My laptop arrived through FedEx Express with questionable packaging. But everything was intact and fine. The laptop still had the plastic wrapped around it as MacBooks directly from Apple do, even with the screen cover. Only 3 battery cycles out of the box, with a new charger in the box. I am very satisfied with the purchase although in the Q&A section of this product someone mentions that this is a 2018 model, its not, its a 2017 (At least the one I received.) which for me isn't really a big deal since it arrived in exceptional condition. Highly recommend this MacBook."
332,I'm a fan of apple products and I like almost everything about this new MBA. But it has one huge flaw that nobody talks about. It's the camera hardware and it hasn't been updated in ages. My zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light. A $1000 laptop with 10 year old front camera is unacceptable. Camera is very important to me. Especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time.
333,"Liked:- Long battery life (one charge WILL last all day, i.e. 16 hours. Personally tested true)- Speed (the new M1 processor really is fast)- Quiet (no fan but the laptop still does not get hot)- Light and portable- High resolution & bright displayDisliked:- As with other MacBooks, the keyboard is mediocre especially compared to laptops like Lenovo Thinkpad- Incompatible applications (With the M1 processor still being new, you might experience existing programs frequently crash. For example, Chrome keeps crashing) But I would guess there will be a fix soon"
334,"UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable.The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long.Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using ""swap memory"" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board.***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB.I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models.There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD.***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly.------I purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12"" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1.The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco.I likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive ""Pro Apps"" running at the same time.I would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.I would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball ""not responding"" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1. If however, you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable, faster and cooler running than the Intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable Mac."
335,"The M1 chip really is amazing. But it only lasted five days for me. Somehow mine managed to break after using a third party USB C hub. The screen wouldn’t turn on at all, and an Apple repair tech couldn’t figure it out after doing a few quick tests. Oh and then Apple said it would take a month to replace it with a new one."
336,"Beautiful laptop. I’ve upgraded from the MacBook Air of old...so far this laptop has blown it away. It wasn’t overly pricey to be honest and I feel it’s worth the price. Overall look is great and keyboard feel is nice. Larger touchpad is great, I’ve paired my Magic Trackpad 2 with it as well."
337,"I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13"" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13"" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.Good:- SCREEN looks great!  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  I usually don't go above 50% brightness.- KEYBOARD is good.  Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard.  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic.  Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great.  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.- LOOKS GREAT.  Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.- NO FAN.  That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.- PERFORMANCE.  It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time.  For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU.  Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27"" (top end) with Intel chips.- TOUCH ID is great still.  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons.  On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA.  Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch).  You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay.  And so on and so forth.- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.NOT GOOD:- WEBCAM still sucks.  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc.  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27"" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera).- ONLY 2 PORTS.  Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort).  Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame.  I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.OVERALL:A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem.  Love it so far!"
338,No complains so far.  Very fast and performs great.  I had a 2014 MacBook Air and finally upgraded this year.  This is leagues beyond that entry and I’m very happy with this upgrade.
339,"Lightweight, blazing fast, easy to use, battery life is incredible with the new Apple M1 chip.  A typical Great Apple product.However, there is only a Thunderbolt port, so you now have to go out and buy a cable to convert USB to thunderbolt (if you want to use a backup hard drive) or other USB items, AND, I had to buy yet another cable to sync my phone's lightning port to the thunderbolt port on the computer. Total $56.I LOVE Apple product, and worked for them in my caerer, but I would wait on buying this version until the software for it has been developed.UPDATE: After several months of using this computer, I have have found several things of concern:1.  my notification center keeps disappearing, despite my constant reinstalling the widgets.2.  my computer's calendar, reminders, and photo stream do not sync with my IOS devices (iPhone & iPad).  If I add an item to calendar on my phone, it will appear on my mac but not vice versa.  Reminders will not sync regardless of which device I originate the item on.I have contacted Apple support on all these issues and they cannot solve the problem.IT APPEARS THAT THE BUGS HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED OUT, YET.  THINGS ARE MADDENINGLY CLUNKY!"

   Bought this laptop bc i needed it for spring semester and i needed an upgrade from my heavy macbook pro. I go to work too so i needed something super light and thin i can just bring everywhere and slide it in my bag.I am obsessed with how fast this macbook is. The battery life is on point. I used it for movies and series at work and it lasted for 3 days. The processor is definitely sooo good. I open so many tabs at once and it has not lagged on me. The keyboard and trackpad is responsive.I love the color. The main reason why i bought this too. 😍😂I have no problems with it at all.Highly recommend"
341,Opened my brand new $1000++ computer and the entire screen was cracked and destroyed. Awesome! Thanks Amazon.
342,"Delivered to me within 12 hours of purchase... Sealed in original apple packaging with protective film, blemish free, not a scratch.. Mint.its powerful, Ive already loaded some big task audio software and broadcast software on it and its flying through the multiple processes together at ease... (Logic 10.5 / Traktor DJ 3.0 / OBS)Super light and portable, If this is a MacBook Pro then I can't even imagine how light the Air models are. Nor could I even imagine why you may need something more powerful. I am having to adjust to the new keyboard and Touch Bar, I keep hitting Siri and volume settings, even as I type this.id also recommend getting a keyboard cover as well.... I hear these keyboards go out sometimes and to repair it. This is no fault to the reseller, but I can't believe Apple with their price points don't offer a bigger SSD for the lowest price point.... 128gb is laughable so be prepared to buy an external SSD along with a Thunderbolt 3 / USB-C Hub to run hdmi, and various external accessories.Overall I love this computer so far, it was a nail biter as I rarely ever shell out $1,000 on anything but I'm very pleased and satisfied with my purchase. And I still cannot find a better deal on the internet, not even used on Facebook marketplace, letgo or craigslist....Five stars"
343,So not worth it. All they want to do is take your money do NOT BUY THIS ONE! Its used and if you search apple on amazon they have brand new with higher stats for cheaper.
344,"Just received this, but so far so good. It looks BRAND NEW. There are literally NO signs of cosmetic wear or damage. It arrived in a sealed apple box. I’m finishing setting up and I already love it. For just under $1,200 for a 2019 model, this is a GREAT deal!"
345,"I really love my MacBook. I really love this laptop. I'm a huge MacBook fan and this works like new. So far I don't have a problem with the butterfly keyboard, but I heard bad reviews about the keyboard from watching YouTube videos. I think that they may have fixed the keyboard problem when they refurbished the product??? I'm not sure, but honestly this a really great laptop for a really great price. I do wish that it came in the original Apple box and packaging, but it wasn't far from the really deal."
346,"It looks and feels brand spanking new! Definitely happy with my purchase considering that I bought a brand new 2020 MacBook Air and hated it. Returned it back in 2 days. I paid a lot less for the Pro than the Air and its A LOT better with so many features. I’m not trying to persuade anyone out of getting the Air but if you are considering on buying a MacBook my advice would be to just go ahead and get the pro. The Air reminds me of a google chrome book slapped with an Apple logo on it. Not saying that google chrome books are bad, but there’s no need to pay a full band for the Air when you could find something similar and a lot cheaper. All in all I really love this laptop."
347,"Bought this laptop with some apprehensions, as i have typically bought refurbished goods from apple directly. This was my first from amazon, and i was not disappointed. The notebook was flawless, not a single scratch on it. second, all the accessories where flawless as well, not signs of usage. When i powered on the notebook to verify usage, the battery had cycled only 3 times, meaning it was still in new condition. Very highly recommended seller. Thanks for a pleasant transaction."
348,"This laptop looked new, straight from Apple store."

   The screen arrived damaged, what a scam.!"
350,"Although I was very skeptical about purchasing a ""refurbished"" MacPro, after reading the reviews for this company, I made the purchase.  The MacPro arrived earlier than expected, expertly wrapped, included Apple certified, and in NEW condition.  There is no way I could tell it was not new or refurbished.  The price was the best I could find after researching other sellers.  I would highly recommend iPower Resale Inc to anyone looking for a MacPro.  Their customer service is exceptional.  Thank you for a great product!  5*****"
351,"When I looked at this product it only had one review and it was a bad one... I then checked all the other products the seller sold and the reviews were excellent, needless to say I took a chance and ordered this MacBook Pro 2019. It arrived before anticipated and it was securely package. I AM SO GLAD I took a chance on them because this MacBook is amazing! Now I’ve waited a couple months before reviewing it to make sure it works. The MacBook looks brand new, it didn’t have any dents or scratches. It works and performs like a new MacBook. I had to contact the seller over the a small issue with the charger and they went above and beyond to correct the issue.Excellent customer service excellent product. I recommend this seller to anyone!"
352,"I got my new MacBook Pro M1 two weeks ago and could not be more happy with it. This machine is absolutely incredible in terms of speed, looks, weight/size, display, and battery life - and texture (it feels so good against the skin on my wrists as I type) and basically anything else you can think of. I also love the space gray color, the new keyboard, the Touch Bar, and the larger trackpad. There are so many options to customize the system to work just the way I like.My previous MacBook was the 2011 model and it still works today, but after 10 years it became too slow and the trackpad had trouble clicking, so after a TON of research, I decided to pull the trigger and get the New MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.A couple suggestions I am able to give after spending almost two months and probably over 30 hours researching the new MacBook are: go with the standard model of 8gb of RAM and the 256 ssd - you can get this on Amazon for $1239 vs $1299 at Apple - so you get to save 60 bucks, and you have the added satisfaction of not having to deal with the snobby nerd losers that work in the Apple Store, who asked me rudely when I went in to get a new laptop ""umm, do you have an appointment? Well, you're going to have to make an appointment if you want to go in the store"". I love Apple products and will never use another phone or computer besides the iPhone and MacBook, but after that experience I will never again give my business to the physical Apple Stores. I mean, seriously, do you really need me to make an appointment to buy a $1300 laptop? Whatever dude.Anyway, in several YouTube videos that compared the 8GB ram model along side the 16GB ram model (costs 200 bucks more), the 8GB performed just as well in nearly every task - and they really pushed it to the limits. The only reason to pay up for the 16GB RAM is if you want to edit 8K UHD videos or are a super serious music recording artist or highly advanced professional photographer - and even then it's not too much of a difference. For the every day user (me or basically anyone who is not a computer professional) the 8GB working with this new M1 chip is mind-blowing, blows any other laptop on the market completely out of the water, and actually even performs just as well as the $2200 15 inch MacBook Pro using the Intel chip. As far as the storage goes, 256 ssd is standard - that's what I got - and you can pay 200 bucks more for 512 ssd or 400 bucks more for 1 TB. But with the Cloud storage available now, you don't really need to keep much on the laptop drive, you can just save it to the cloud.Overall I honestly could go on for hours about every little detail that I absolutely love about this machine. A free one year subscription to Apple TV is also another little perk. But I am still mystified every day at how incredible this machine is. I've been online for over 3 hours now and its still on 92% battery. The new Retina display is brilliant. Everything is perfect. I truly am in love this laptop and would recommend that anyone looking for a new laptop to last a long time and outperform everything else on the market gets the new matchbook 13 inch M1."
353,I bought my Mac from Apple directly not from Amazon. This thing is amazing. Battery life is awesome. Hard to believe that I can work with it all day and do not have to charge at all even with bright screen.No issues with speed at all. I use Matlab a lot and this computer is even slightly faster than my desktop with 12 core AMD CPU and 32 GB ram.Excellent machine. Happy I bought it.
354,"I own over 50 computers and it blows away my 11th gen Dell XPS 13 i7, My surface Book 3, my Ryzen 7 Thinkpad. the first week I got it the battery lasted for 5 days and 22 hrs of use and still had 20% left. I felt guilty and charged it. The Geekbench 5 rating beat all those listed laptops and they had 16 or 32GB of memory and the MacBook Pro M1 had only 8GB of unified memory. The keyboard felt great, the sound was superb, the screen bright, and it was blazing fast in all I did. I'm an IT consultant and deal in Windows based databases and this Mac has now become my daily go to system at home. It has become my new front end."
355,It's a Mac once you go Mac you never go back. This is my second Mac my first lasted almost 9 years.
356,Dead at arrival.... kernel error. Took it to the Apple store they told me looks like a hardware failure and to send it back to Amazon.
357,"I'm going to preface this review with the 1 thing I dislike so we can get that out of the way.I mean let's be honest, that's what most people are looking for when buying a product-the down sides.It has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack EVEN THOUGH apple quit using that on it's handheld products years ago.Not that I care, it's good that they include the 3.5mm jack-but how come they didn't include one for their lightning connector that their headphones come in out of the box? Forces you to either change to a standard headphone jack or BT headphones (probably trying to push their AirPods line).Other than that, I have no issues. It's fast, efficient, reliable and easy to use. If your familiar with iOS on these then it'll be a great addition to the tech team you have at home."
358,"I love my new MacBook Pro!!  It’s the 13” and not too small. It’s very lightweight!  It’s so fast!  I was using an older MacBook Pro from mid 2012. It worked well, just so slow. This one flies!!  I was disappointed that there are no USB ports or CD player. I spent about $65 at Best Buy and got an adapter that works very well!!!"
359,The battery lasts forever and its fast. My last macbook had a pretty good battery and worked very well for years too.The M1 does allow for dual external monitors and there are two usbc ports total. These two things can be worked around with dongles and a video hub but now I have $200 worth of accessories and a tangled mess on my desk.How is a 2020 Mac not compatible with dual monitors but my 2005 HP works great with the same monitor setup?!? I really can't get past that.Get the intel version with 4 USB ports and you can use it in your Covid home office out of the box.
360,"There is no fix for this, and now it can't be returned.  All that money wasted!!! There is a vertical black line on the screen.  I tried to fix it using tips from youtube videos and none of it worked.  Proceed with caution!"
361,"I really wanted to love this laptop. I've had only Macs for years. This was supposed to be an upgrade from my 2014 MacBook Air. I previously had a 2020 16"" intel based MacBook Pro for work configured with two HP monitors. No issues with the monitors and connected instantly with zero effort to get the screens to work with the laptop. Bought this one and connected to my Belkin hub for the HDMIs. Would only connect a single monitor. Googled the issue and found that the new M1 apple chip only supports a single monitor. News to me and I guess I should have researched more. However the low rating stems from the fact that this is a PRO laptop. A professional would want two monitors and should not have to google whether a PRO laptop supports more than 1 monitor when the intel version does seamlessly. Despite this I had planned to keep it and just deal with 1 monitor because of the cost savings over buying the Intel based MacBook Pro and wanted the longer battery life. Now brings me to the issue that made me return the laptop. This laptop just would not configure to show a clear resolution with my monitors. The scale was off and the display just stayed blurry no matter what setting I changed it to on the monitor or the laptop's settings. Tried and tried and just gave up. Returned this and ordered an Intel based 13"" MacBook Pro. No issues, supports dual monitors, and seamlessly integrated to the laptop. No blurry screen and no having to set or change any settings to get it to work. I am floored that Apple would produce a Pro for business that only supports a single monitor. I love Apple but will not buy anything with their chip until the kinks are worked out."
362,This is by far the best laptop ive ever owned! The laptop came with 0 scratches and only 16 battery charges on it. It even came with the apple box and stickers! Highly reccomend for the price. $850 is great for a 2019 macbook air.
363,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Everything I expected and more! Just like brand new!"
364,I love this laptop so so much. I think everyone should get it. The model is between 2018-2020 and the one I got had the Touch ID on it! Everything was very easy to set up and is in such great quality!
365,"Received in a timely manner.  Will review in a couple weeks.Well, it's been over 2 weeks since receiving my MacBook Air and I have to admit that it has proven to be worth it's price. The Retina display is phenomenal and it's compact chassis is just what I was looking for. I am not a power user, so I didn't need major memory capacity. The speakers are, surprisingly, crisp and clear for such a slim build. The fingerprint scanner is quick and a huge convenience. I am (or was) a long-time PC user and resisted getting an Apple, but the transition was smooth and Apple's claim to fame for being user-friendly and intuitive proved true. If you are looking for a compact, yet capable laptop with QWERTY keyboard, I would recommend this product."
366,"After having the laptop a few months, I can say my leap of faith to buy an amazon refurbished was worth it BUT I had to work a little bit.  It didn't arrive perfect and it still isn't perfect.  There is a tiny white dot on the screen where some pixels died (I guess) and when I first got it, I had to call Apple support to get iMessage and Facetime to work on it.  Then I had to take it to the Apple store to get the keyboard fixed as some keys would not work.  Thankfully, I had Apple Care on it so the cost to get it shipped off and fixed wasn't bad.  Overall, I am happy with my purchase and I recommend this seller, but I will probably buy new next time."
367,"** I have only had the laptop for a week, this review is only based off of the time I have had it**I was so nervous to buy a refurbished computer but this came like it was brand new. New packaging, new charger, spotless laptop. I was worried the battery would be bad and wouldn’t hold a charge. I was wrong. I downloaded over 12,000 photos and was on it nonstop for over 2 days without even having to charge it. I am in love with this!!!"
368,"As in the description exactly, thank the seller for the fast shipping and good packaging"
369,I love this laptop and I’m really happy with all the features. Would definitely recommend.
370,Exactly as expected. Great value.
371,"The product made a loud buzzing/grinding airplane-type noise as soon as it finished setting up which was truly deafening. I presume it was the fan producing this aggravating sound. No programs were running and the room was approximately 68 degrees Fahrenheit so overheating should not have been an issue. Since no computer should ever sound like a coffee maker at any time, I must conclude that it was defective. Return to sender."
372,Exceeded my expectations! Some of the reviews had me a bit nervous but I can’t tell you how happy I am! The laptop is on almost brand new condition! Only 1 TINY nick on the front (you can’t see it unless your looking) and it was perfectly ready for me to set up my account! No issues or problems! It comes in a box perfectly protected and has the charger to go with as well👍🏼 So happy with it! Thank you!
373,"I was so excited because this laptop came in perfect condition. But when I tried to change the unsername to my name it wouldn’t work. 3 calls to Apple later, and I find out this computer is owned by a school that can remotely access my laptop at any time. Meaning, if they wanted to they could shut down and erase my laptop. Amazon gave me a full refund but I am very sad and disappointed"
374,"All in all, the laptop works great! It runs fast, it’s clean, and it’s perfect for what I needed it. The one disappointment I have it they claimed this product as a catagory A which means like new. When it arrived, the screen had two scratch marks on it that was discolored from the rest of the screen. I would understand like new for any other part to have a scratch, but the screen is a big deal and it should have mentioned that in the details."
375,"This MacBook Air is amazing!  I had been previously using a 2007 MacBook Air and it was time to upgrade.  I have never purchased refurbished before so I really didn't know what to expect, though was greatly concerned.  Needless to say that this laptop heavily exceeded my expectations.  Other reviewers stated that their MacBook was not as described, though mine looks brand new.  The keys are still crisp and clean, the screen immaculate.  There are a few light scratches on the outside of the computer (mostly the underside), but it is very minimal and unnoticeable.It runs like a dream, though I have only begun using it.  I will update should the computer have any issues.  It is an early 2015 with 4 GB RAM and its OS is Sierra.  I wanted to share that, as I found the Q&A to be a little confusing on that point and other reviews didn't really mention it."
376,"When I received this package, I was thrilled...until I tried to turn it on and got a “low battery” notification...for 16+ hours. Turns out the cord provided (not a Mac product) is not the correct wattage to charge this device. It’s hard to tell at this point if the computer is faulty or not now that I’ve purchased a new cord from Best Buy, but it shuts down as soon as it’s disconnected from power. The screen is pretty floppy, too- falls back without provocation. All of which seem like things that should have been mentioned in the details before I decided to purchase.After taking this computer to the Apple store, I was informed that the issue was indeed the battery- completely bad and had to be replaced. Again, something that I wish I had known before purchasing. It is in working order now, but doesn’t meet my standards of what “certified refurbished” means, and product details lacking for sufficient purchasing knowledge ahead of time."
377,"It said I had to do an update. When I hit the only update allowed it said the latest version was already installed but it wouldn’t let me go foward.  Also the screen seemed loose.  So if it was cleared out they never installed the new software correctly. So it wouldn’t let me even get to the main screen.  Others had luck but I did not.Also when I plugged the power bar in. It had a bit of a shock come out. As an electrician, I know that was a big no no.  I was willing to spend the money and get the correct power cord. But with everything else. I thought that’s already 3 strikes. No thanks."
378,I was very hesitant buying a used MacBook from Amazon but it turned out great! Looks new and works amazingly. You will receive exactly what was described. I have no complaints!
379,"Good quality, arrived early. As-new condition. Easy to install from my old machine via time machine backup. The old one was a 2010, now we are good for another 5-7 years.Thanks"
380,I have been struggling with this product since day one. I am not getting responses from the seller OR the extended warranty repair company.I have never had trouble with Amazon before. Every issue I have ever had has been settled with ease and courtesy.This has not. Made more devastating as it it is the largest purchase I have had and the product has been unusable almost since day one. We sent it to the extended warranty place who said they fixed it but it still doesn’t work.We have spent hours at Apple doing diagnostics and it is simply not functional. To repair it would cost more than I paid. They do not think that the parts it was refurbished with are even Apple parts.This was a terrible product and not worth the money.
381,"I bought this Mac and it came with a non Apple charger, I bought this as travel computer, sure enough in the first week while I was in Europe I had to buy am authentic Apple charger at $117. Now a month  later my Mac has died. It was having issues as in when I tried to maximize the scene with Netflix it would just shrink to a 3x5"" screen volume,  also the screen had been replaced before I bought it and is not well attached, very disappointed, I bought this last summer, but only started to use it in October when I was traveling, so I spent close to $700 for a Mac that lasted 2 months, return and replacement window has ""closed"" so I am stuck with a hefty repair bill."
382,"Was very iffy about buying refurbished but it’s honestly like new! There are a couple of LITTLE scratches but nothing noticeable! Compared to my friends MacBook Air that she paid 1100$ for and they are the absolute same. Best $500 I’ve ever spent. & the company is AWESOME! The charger didn’t work as soon as I got it & I emailed them. Within an hour I had an email from them and they were sending me a new charger, thankful my friend had her charger that I used until I received mine but the battery last like 2-3 days so it wasn’t that bad."
383,"Seller: IT5050Wowie! My son wanted an Apple Computer for Christmas and I was not about to spend $1000+ on a laptop for a 11-year-old boy. But a refurbished MacBook was definitely priced more appropriate for him. This computer is AMAZING people!!! Looks so clean and new. Only a couple faint scratches on the bottom, the keyboard looks like it was hardly touched, screen is clear and no burn marks in it, plus the battery is great. The seller was so awesome to get me this gift in time for Christmas, they are quick to respond to emails and followed up to make sure it was delivered afterward. (seriously, the nicest people!) I had purchased another renewed MacBook from another seller, and their level of quality wasn’t as good, by far. I wish I could pre-select a quality grade for the laptop (excellent, good, fair, etc.), so it is a little scary just leaving it up to the unknown. I work in the retail business and I like to applaud small companies who sell quality products. Do yourself a favor and go here, they gave me a laptop that is stellar and eased my worries about a refurbished laptop. It really looks so good and is operating perfectly. This is such a smarter way to buy a computer, especially for kids, or if you like to have the pricier brands without spending the high price. – Happy Mommy!"
384,"Wow! Bought this from TECHarvard and was claimed to be Certified Refurbished, which according to the Amazon description should show limited to no signs of wear.  Well the device that I received not only was pretty scratched on the bottom, had a huge ding on the corner of the top cover, but the keyboard showed more signs of wear than the MacBook that I've had for 5 years(Space bar was completely warped).  Definitely does not resemble a new device in any way shape or form.  If they are selling used devices, call them used and mark the price down accordingly.  This is definitely going back."
385,"Overall the laptop is nice. A couple of marks on the outside but works relatively well. There was an issue with the battery that originally came with it. It would shut off around 65% battery life. I asked the seller for a replacement battery, which they gave to me free of charge. However, the replacement battery is not originally an Apple battery and instead a knock off. This issue prompted it to restart randomly no matter what the battery life was at. I’m putting the original battery back in and having Apple replace it with the appropriate battery for an additional fee. I got what a paid for and I won’t make the mistake of buying a refurbished Apple product from anywhere other than the Apple store again."
386,This is the BEST purchase I’ve ever made! The laptop 💻 arrived on time and in MINT condition. It functions beautifully and works flawlessly for my personal and business needs. I would recommend this seller to any & all I know who are in the market for reliable and affordable devices.
387,"Battery doesnt work! I travel to another country with the laptop and web I turned on and unplug it, it shuts down! And in Battery Options appears ""Replace now"". How you can help me? I'm in Ecuador now and wont be back in a year!"
388,"I love my new MacBook Air, it came as expected (relatively like new condition). This my first Mac and I’d purchase it again refurbished, you save greatly and get almost the same product 😀"
389,Bought certified refurbished ended up with a unit with a screen covered in dead pixels. I contacted apple to see how much a screen replacement should be more I'm looking a repair cost more than I paid for the laptop.
390,"DO NOT BUY!!! I purchased this computer for about two month and one day I couldn’t turn it on after it goes into sleep mode for a long time. It just wouldn’t turn no matter what I do, I tried every single method out there. I had to press the power button a hundred times for it to finally turn on. But after a while even that won’t work. The computer is just dead. I had to take it to the computer store and they told me it costs $434 to fix it!!!! Even though I actually paid to get it fixed I recommend everyone do not buy!! It’s not worth the money and will cost you more!! The guy in the computer store told me that there is corrosion inside the motherboard and in order to fix it it costs a lot of money ($434). I am truly upset and wished I would have just bought a brand new one from apple that’s the newest version and which will cost me less than what I spent on this computer!!"
391,"The laptop worked great the first week. Eventually, things started to decline and quickly.  I would constantly have to change the time clock, and that would prevent many apps from working properly or not at all. I also discovered that my webcam did not work. I asked customer service if I could get a replacement laptop, and they gave me a website to help me fix it myself. It did not work. Also, the computer would start dying very quickly, even after a full charge. I would also not start up automatically, even with the charger plugged in. I had to press to start button almost endlessly for it to just power on. Eventually, it just would not cut on at all, even with the charger plugged in. It’s completely dead. Apple says that it should cut on with the charger plugged in if it were a battery issue, so it’s definitely something wrong with it beyond that and it will cost upwards of $400 to fix. I’m totally bummed. It did not even last a year."
392,"BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY MOTHER, SHE IS 70 YEARS OLD AND BARELY USES THE LAPTOP.THE SCREEN IS IN THIS STATE, APPEARS TO BE PEELING! VERY BAD!!"

   Note: My purchase was completed through Kanga Supply for this item that ultimately doesn't function as intended.Amazon Renewed item descriptions indicate that the products should work and look like new, which wasn’t the case for this purchase, ergo my poor rating. After only having the Macbook for less than a day, I was forced to reach out to the seller because the product no longer functioned as intended.CONSThe Macbook worked fine for the first hour or so of use, but during an update, the screen flickered vigorously (see video). I hoped it was just a fluke, and it led me to believe there may be some software or hardware-related issue. After having the Macbook for less than 12 hours, I was forced to reach out to the seller because the screen flickering caused the laptop to become unusable (see picture). I also came here to draft a review in hopes that my issue is resolved quickly and effectively. I'll update my review once this is complete.PROSAfter removing the laptop and inspecting the outside, I was pleased. The outside of the Macbook is in good condition, just one or two visible scratches or marks.The charger was not the original Apple charger (as other reviews have indicated) but an OEM adapter. I don’t care that much about whether it’s an Apple charger, as long as it functions.Specs match the advertised item I purchased:128GB SSD8GB ramEDIT/UPDATE: After reaching out to the seller as instructed with the Amazon Renewed products, I never got a response in the allotted timeframe (2 business days) and was forced to reach out to Amazon directly. Ultimately, this item was returned for a refund.UPDATE 2: Today is 1/13/2020 and I have still yet to see this problem resolved to my satisfaction (refund or exchange of working product), after having ordered this product on 12/26/2019. Highly disappointed both in Amazon and the third-party seller.UPDATE 3: Received a replacement Macbook on 1/15/2020. So far it seems to be working, no issues with the screen per the previous item received (was NOT the same item sent back, verified by serial number). Pleased so far with this item."
394,"The 2015 Macbook Pro is still, in my opinion, the best Macbook even in 2019.  I use the SD card reader all the time and have several USB 3.0 devices.  I also use a newer 2017 quad-core i7 for work (no choice) but the difference in speed is not worth the added money and lacking ports.  When I actually put the newer 2017 to work, the heat issue is still a challenge for Apple and performance drops.  It's like having power that I can't actually use unless I sit in a walk-in freezer. Don't quote benchmark speed tests to me, what counts is actual performance sitting at my desk for hours at a time working on a project. I also prefer the magsafe power (although this one uses the magsafe II which I like less than magsafe I which had a more solid connection) This one, I purchased for my wife and it handles everything she needs it to do. Although you can't upgrade the memory on these models, so make sure you get enough for what you need.  If you want to change out memory, then the best choice is the Mid 2012 non-retina model which also come with DVD drives and has USB 3.0 ports."
395,"First off, I am removing a star because they shipped a counterfeit 60W Magsafe 2 charger with my order. I contacted them immediately and they offered to accept a return of everything. I explained that the charger was my only complaint and they overnight FedEx'd a genuine Apple replacement for free.""we sent you the wrong adapter for this batch of order and will overnight you the correct genuine one.""So they knowingly ship counterfeit chargers with some of their orders?The computer is pretty good cosmetically and operationally, but not as great as other reviewers. It is an Early-2015 12,1 model, this one was built in 12/2016. There is a crease over the right USB port from somebody yanking a USB plug. The battery has 107 cycles (89% life left). Keyboard and display are in great shape with no flaws. The SSD has no dead cells. It came with MacOS 10.13 installed.Overall its a good laptop and decent refurbishment job.EDIT: Knocking off another star. They sent me another counterfeit charger. Apple would never loosely jumble the cord in the box, a genuine power supply doesn't stay powered on for several seconds after it's unplugged from the main or stay lit green/orange after its unplugged from the laptop and this fake only puts out 25 watts max."
396,"I really feel like I got a great deal on this, mine arrived in brand new condition and it looked like it had never been used. I did see some people had bad experiences but mine was well worth the price tag. The only negative was that the charger provided is third party and not OEM Apple. The box is also generic and not Apple, not a big deal but you just don't get that same feeling opening it up as a new product. I will say that I checked the serial number on Apple and the computer itself was only a couple of years old, so in reality I paid around $450 for an Apple that was only a couple of years old with a decent amount of battery life still left. I only bought this as there was certain tasks that I could not do on my iPad and so I did not need a brand new super powerful computer. This one is great, does not get hot, fans are silent and the display looks incredible.Overall I was very happy with the purchase, it came fast and was like new condition at the fraction of the cost of a new one. I actually waited a few months before writing this review so that I could also include that I have had no issues at all in that time, battery lasts a decent amount of time and no software or hardware issues to report. It also runs the latest OS that I updated it to and I believe it will be supported software wise for some time to come. Completely worth the price!"

   The Macbook came in working condition with all original components and an OEM charger but not with the extension cord. The major downfall is the condition of the laptop, for the above average asking price for this model I expected great condition as it is stated to be like new but instead the model I received was in okay condition (not cleaned either, large collection of gunk in hinge vent) at best with a lot of edge scratches and deep cuts throughout the chassis, and some unremovable stains from stickers! And worst of all the battery was at over 500 cylces, the battery life was 4-5 hrs max! thats horrible for whats suppose to be a renewed device! Not satisfied!EDIT:  Avoid this entire listing especially from the seller ''Easymobiledevices'', they ship dirty grade b laptop and have poor costumer service."
398,Once i started running it all sort of problems arises. First major problem is wifi drops off and will not let you connect to wifi. After this happens you cant even turn on/off the wifi. Used guest and still no wifi. Restarting or shutdown and restart will not activate wifi. If you restart it takes so long to reboot. Sometimes it get stuck on the waiting wheel on startup. One out of ten restart wifi will work for a minute but then drops off and you will no longer be able to connect again. I cant say anything physically because it looks fine. Lastly beware it shows and says freshly installed mojave os but it has instead sierra installed. The power cord looks like an imitation and not the original one because from the weight it is not the original one. I can tell because i have multiple macbook at home and that is not the original one. I am pretty disappointed with this seller.
399,"I’ll update 15 days from today.CONS:-Delivery packaging: it was a regular box with one thick bubble wrap to protect the laptop.First glance, the charger seems pretty beat up but seems to work fine.-The outer top of the laptop has a lot of scuff marks and scratches. Sides do as well. Nothing TOO severe.-Bottom have some scratches and wearing on the rubber, not too noticeable.PROS:-Had a full battery-Set up went smoothly with no hiccups.-Outer signature glowing Apple works well.-Opening the laptop, the screen has no visible scratches, cracks, or scuffs at all.-Keyboard has no loose keys and is glowing well.-Trackpad has no scratches and works really well no weird working sides SO FAR.-Software automatically updated to Catalina, kinda wanna wait to update to Big Sur.I’ll update March 13, 2021"
400,"Still a GREAT LAPTOP, arguably the best MacBook Pro 13” ever made, 2 or 3 iterations later! I have had mine for 3 months now and although I was a little disappointed that I got a no-brand MagSafe power brick instead of an Apple brand, it’s caused no problems for me. I have been using Logic Pro X a lot and it runs nice and smooth even with the haphazard way I use it, leaving muted unused tracks all over the place as I learn about things like track bouncing and experiment with every single effect and different audio formats (I feel bad sometimes like I am unnecessarily abusing the laptop, lol) and I haven’t frozen or crashed at all. I have used a few emulation programs for old Saturn, Super Famicom, PS and Dreemcast games that push the 2D sprite and parallax scrolling envelope and again I haven’t had any problems. Only thing I have experienced that has been an issue is the actual Mac OS and it’s limitations with regard to formats, programs that it supports and connectivity with outside developers but I have also been able to get around that by setting Virtual Machines up and GUID partitioning to use whatever other OS I need. This is also not a complaint about the hardware itself but rather the Mac OS software so should not be considered when it comes to the actual MacBook Pro 13”.You will want to upgrade to an NVME M2 SSD at least 256 GB or 512 GB right away, as the 128 GB SSD will fill up within 2-3 months of moderate use and the newer M2s will increase the OS loading speed more than anything else. Luckily you have your pick of great SSDs like the Samsung 970 Evo, etc that you can easily swap in with a $5 adapter, a screwdriver and no soldering (just search YouTube for “MB Pro 13 2015 SSD upgrade”)…The unique things and PROS about this MB Pro 13” are the older style KEYBOARD that doesn’t break like 2016-later model keyboards do, 2 USB 3 ports, an SD CARD R/W and a FULL SIZE HDMI PORT all built in. This is the last MB Pro 13 with any of those ports on board and the fact that you can swap SSD hard drives with no soldering and very little skill needed, all-in with the M2 you get a sexy little powerhouse for half the price of the newer model Pro 13”s (1/4 price of current gen)! The rest (CPU, onboard graphics, sound/speakers) make this laptop a must have that will likely only appreciate in value $$$!Two Thunderbolt 2/miniDisplayPorts are useful if you want to setup 2-3 Screens, but the CONS Are that you get NO ThunderBolt 3/USB-C ports and more and more adapters and devices require that connection these days, though with the USB 3 ports there are ways around it, complicated as they may be. You also CANNOT UPGRADE RAM unless you know how to de-solder the current ram and solder up new ram (accepts up to 16GB DDR-3 in 2X8GB formation) and setup the machine to accept the new ram, which seems a recipe to completely destroy the board/laptop without at least some Mac building & Mac hardware programming know-how, possibly even special equipment.MAKE SURE YOU GET THE MODEL WITH THE AMOUNT OF RAM YOU NEED BUILT IN & a CPU that will be sufficient for you and you won’t be disappointed with this awesome little 6 year old laptop! Don’t get the 4 GB model even if it will “work” for you “short-term”! I got the 8GB/i5 2.9Ghz/128GB and I already regret not paying another $100 for the 16GB ram model, but c’est la vie.Just buy this MacBook Pro 13” while you can, replace the SSD as soon as possible, enjoy it, keep it another 5-10 years and you will likely be able to triple your investment by reselling it assuming Apple stays on their current trajectory with their MB Pro Hardware releases!!!"
401,"Hi, I bought this Macbook Pro 13"" early 2015 and received last week on Aug 23th. The laptop has a good appearance and doesn't have any flaws. However, the charger(45w) packed together with the macbook is not for macbook pro but for  Macbook Air. I just found out today, cuz when I use the charger(45w) laptop cpu temperatures goes up to 65-85 celcius. and I can't use more than 4 hours. But when I charge my macbook with Macsafe 1 (85w, which is for Pro), the cpu temperature keeps 40-50 degree, and it runs around 10hours. I want to change my charger into “MacBook Pro Charger 85w”. Thank you."
402,I'm very dissatisfied with this purchase.I can't use the Mac because the hard drive was not reset and the software on the Mac dose not allow you to use it.Also there was no charger.Again very disappointed.
403,"Looks brand new, wrapped and sealed in Apple packaging. Plugged it in and turned it on and let it go. Absolutely no problems, it was automatic and wonderful to have the computer set itself up. Has performed flawlessly as expected of an Apple laptop."
404,"The laptop arrived in fair condition.  The screws show signs of wear so it may have been opened up during the ""renewal"" process.  Old stickers were left on the bottom. Also, the laptop was shipped with a cheap knockoff Chinese charger.  I have no reason to trust this charger so I'll have to order a genuine Apple one instead.Fortunately I don't need this machine to be a workhorse or I would send it back.  This should survive a year at least but I don't trust it as-is - I will wipe the hard disk, NVRAM, and SMC just to be safe."
405,Product was faulty. The charging port wouldn't hold the plug. I returned it. I don't think the refurbishing process is very competent.
406,"This is exactly like the MacBook I was given for work that was stolen on a plane flight. No problems with this as a replacement so far, smooth sailing for 3 months already! I got the protection plan just in case, but I'm very satisfied with this cheaper than new replacement. Will update if there are any issues that arise. Would recommend."
407,"Idk what I was thinking not having an apple in the first place. This laptop is very easy to use, fast, and I’m excited to see how productive I can be with this format. I feel free, nothing holding me back now!! Unlike old pc with unresponsive interface, slow speeds, and constant crashes, this one gives me no problems!!"
408,This laptop was literally like brand new out of the box. So far my daughter is so thrilled with her graduation gift. She is ready for college now!!!
409,"Our first ever Mac but so far its been quite impressive. It was easy to setup and get it going. It works well and very easy to use, turn on/off, carry around and day to day life. Wish the battery would last a bit longer."
410,"BUYER BEWARE!I knew by choosing a refurbished computer, I was taking a risk, but I never expected this. When I received this MacBook Air, I was surprised it was the model Apple stopped making in 2017, since the title said “Newest Version.” I emailed the seller and they said Amazon forced that in the title and told me I could return it. I work full time, am in grad school, and have three kids. I figured with it being an Apple it would last long enough to get me through school, so I kept it. Now, six months later the screen won’t turn on. It’s completely black.I am able to connect to an external monitor and use the computer that way, so I know it’s the display. After trying to adjust the brightness, several resets, resetting the SMC and the PRAM, I called Apple Support. They ruled out all software issues and told me it had to be the hardware.At this point I contacted the seller and they basically told me “sorry, it’s outside of the 90 day window so there’s nothing we will do for you.” I have escalated to Amazon trying to get some kind of resolution. They just confirmed there is nothing they are willing to do for me. They also are not doing anything to penalize the seller, All Out Apple. I'm shocked at Amazon. Shady sellers like All Out Apple will always be around, but I really thought Amazon was better than Ebay in that way. Lesson Learned.There is no reason a MacBook Air should have a display of a completely stops functioning after six months of use, even refurbished. I’m grateful that I had a work-provided monitor I can plug into to do my schoolwork, but if I was aiming to be tethered to my desk, I would have bought a Mac Mini."
411,"Got the computer two days early! this was probably the fastest delivery I've ever received from amazon. I wasn't going to buy refurbished but I really wanted another MacBook and shelling out $2k for a new one was simply out of the question. When I saw the price for this MacBook Air, I decided to roll the dice and buy it. I knew it could possibly come not as advertised, such as having scratches or not being updated as far as software is concerned but when I opened it up it was practically BRAND NEW! set up was simple as can be! only took me 5 minutes to sign in with my Apple ID and all my information was synced between my iPhone and iPad and onto the MacBook Air. There were a few minor scratches less than a couple centimeters on the bottom of the computer nothing that noticeable. the charger doesn't stick as well as I'd like and one of the hinges is half broken off but I've that same issue with practically every MacBook I've ever had. I was really surprised with the quality. it said 2017 version but with all the updates and new iterations its hard to gauge which MacBook your getting I thought I was purchasing a much older MacBook Air than what I got this thing is amazing and the 13 in screen is far larger than I expected it to be feels like a 15 or 17 in display when having it in your hands/ the computer itself is incredibly light, the main reason I chose the air you can carry it in anywhere with one hand and hardly feel it definitely much lighter than my 2020 iPad 11"" All in all if you're on a budget, this computer is the way to go! for $400 its practically brand new and runs like a dream! thanks amazon for this incredible refurbished Mac! love it !"
412,"I don’t what to think I bought 2017 16gb 256 ssd but I received a refurbished 2019 8g 256 perfectly packaged, I can’t put apple care I already call for that but im not sure to keep it because I want a computer of 16of ram but this one is 2019, im gonna give the chance to see how it works, And it cost me the same price of a refurbished 2019 Of apple but those ones you can put apple care"
413,"hola, soy de peru. Estoy contento con la compra, la compre por el precio, y me llego tal cual las especificaciones.(late2018,2.3gz,8ram,256ssd). la bateria llego con 350 ciclos aproxen cuanto a lo estetico, tenia pequeños arañones en un costado, pero nada grave, la pantalla intacta y el touchbar ok. el cargador sellado oem.califico la compra como 9/10."
414,Got a few months out of this before the screen started disappearing intermittently. Then it wasn't so intermittent. I'd have much rather spent the extra money to get a new computer that didn't break than to buy something second-hand and have to decide to repair or replace.
415,"Considering I was 100% ripped off, I would not recommend you purchase from this seller, I did not receive what I wanted, the serial number for a COMPUTER comes up as an iPhone 11... Just.. No."
416,This computer was working fine and all of a sudden the screen went out.  Cost me $640 to fix it.
417,"Delivery was super fast, considering I’m in South Africa. The laptop is simply beautiful, woks well, no complaints, I love it."
418,"Positivo, EXCELENTE EQUIPO!!!"
419,So far this was a steal. Great product for a great value.
420,super machine
421,The space key and some of the keys were not working As they are supposed to. Really sticky
422,"Arrived, boxed well with balloon cushions. Power adapter looked clean but had scratches. Opened up the Lid of the MacBookPro and it looked like it had some sort of disease or cancer & it smelled quite strange too. It had over 50% battery so I carried on with a reset which resulted in an error. Luckily it booted back into Yosemite OS that it had installed years ago, after 3 failed attempts managed to update to Mojave. Of course first things first copy music etc onto, USB stick struggled to go in either of the USB Ports (look at the photos) was also stuck after insertion but managed to pull out, with a hard pull - full force - anger. Had a look into the ports and discovered they were literally rusted dirty like disgusting, this is not the definition of Refurbished - but 2nd Hand or Heavily Used. Be aware, set your expectations right in oder to avoid any disappointments."
423,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I was super stoked upon arrival, began setting up the laptop and within minutes the screen stopped working. Literally pixels. Severely disappointed. I have gotten ahold of kanga and they are working to replace the device but it has now been over a week since I’ve purchased the unit with two day shipping and still have nothing to show for it. I hope they come through on their end and send me a functional unit."
424,"I've only had it for about a week now and this 2015 MacBook Pro is working phenomenally! I was kinda hesitant buying a refurbished MacBook from Amazon, but I can honestly say I'm go glad I went ahead and did. It came extremely fast and right from opening the box, it was as if I had bought a brand new one right from Apple themselves. There's not a scratch, dent, stain, dust or anything on it. So far it's working extremely well and I will definitely buy form this seller in the future and recommend them to others as well! Great price for a great computer."
425,"I’ve had this MacBook Pro going on 4 days and so far so good! It has met all my expectations and more. I grew up using windows PCs. This is my first Apple computer and I’m happy to have made the transition. Wish I did this long time ago but better late then never. If it wasn’t for the packaging and not being in the original box, I probably wouldn’t be able to tell this was refurbished. This is just based from my experience using MacBooks at the Apple store. Also, there was a few minor scratches on the bottom of the laptop.I will revise and change review in a month if any problems. But as of now, my review above is how I feel."
426,"I've only had it for a couple days, but so far this is a great purchase. The thing looks brand new, and I know it isn't. I am replacing an older Mac and just can't afford the prices of new machines from Apple. Using Migration Assistant (an app that comes with Macs) I was able to restore a time machine backup from the old machine, so I've lost nothing in the transition."
427,"When I ordered this product for the first time, it came with a green line on the screen. I contacted the costumer service, they responded very quickly and replaced it.The second computer came with better specs, I was the happiest person... for 2 months though, the computer suddenly stop responding.Other things that are worth saying:- The charger is generic. A generic charger can easily damage the battery of the computer, that could explain my problem.- The second computer they sent, had a sticker that covered the whole low part of the computer (those stickers that are the same color as the computer and are used to cover up very big scratches.Conclusion: they can deliver a great costumer service, but not a working product."
428,"The macbook pro only worked for a short while. It had a charging/powering problem - wouldn't keep a charge at first, then wouldn't power on even when plugged in. Confirmed it was not a charger issue.I contacted the company who said to send it back for repair. Once they received it they wrote saying it cannot be fixed and charged me a ""restocking fee"" in the amount of the purchase of the laptop. Outrageous!! I even had a protection plan for it. After numerous interactions they refused to help and returned the laptop without telling me. THEN they said they couldn't do anything in terms of a refund because I had the machine. Months later they refuse to resolve it and amazon can't help me because it's a third party seller. An ABSOLUTE JOKE of a company. I'm out over $500.00 with a computer that can't be fixed - and Apple store said they could try but for more than the computer's worth. So yeah. They have my money and I have nothing.DO NOT BUY from these people if you'd like to keep your money."
429,"Hey all! So I’ve gotten into photography lately and needed a upgrade from my old 2012 MacBook Pro and 2011 Asus laptops for editing. Figured a 2015 model would be the way to go for a decent upgrade without spending tons of money. I was super skeptical about buying a reconditioned one through Amazon after reading the reviews and thought about it for about 4 hours before I made the transaction. Next day it was at my door step with me a bit nervous about opening the package and seeing a beat up MacBook, I opened the box and the MacBook was in a bubble wrapped sleeve and that’s it. Okay I’m fine with that but what was the condition of it? Looks like it barely got used or the previous owner always had a case on it. Outside from a few nicks here and there it’s flawless. Turns on and is super quick, the Retina display is beautiful and definitely enjoyable to watch movies. It came with Mojave so the first thing I did was update it to Big Sur and it’s still flawless. I’ve only had it for a day if that but so far I’m happy with my purchase. Just be mindful yours may or may not be like mine condition wise I got lucky. Should you buy one of these? I would I’m pleased with my purchase and I’m sure you would be too. But I’ll update with any issues if they come up in the future. Thankfully I’m a bit tech savvy so whatever happens I’m sure I can fix it."
430,"This of course this is an old model and reconditioned/renewed, so I was expecting it to look somewhat used; however, this MacBook Pro is in PERFECT CONDITION as if I had purchased it new. I'm upgrading from a very heavy and slow 2009 white MacBook that's a dinosaur and I could only do very basic things on it. It has almost zero capability in terms of battery life (it could only be used plugged in) so this laptop is an absolute gem in comparison. This might be why I'm so hyped and elated. Plus the price was very good. *I hope the computer doesn't have some sudden glitch and dies on me...lol!Now, I can finally edit my videos in iMovie, which was not working on the old MacBook, because I couldn't update it anymore. I need this laptop mainly for traveling, to do editing work, I have a 2 monitor PC set-up at home. My only wish is that I could transfer my Adobe CS to the new laptop.SIDE NOTE: it's actually overall a little smaller than my old 13"" (screen size is the same), it's not as heavy, but not as light as the Air; it arrived with Catalina iOS installed and I had to upgrade to Monterey to use the newest version of iMovie - this isn't a complaint, just an observation."
431,"I bought for my mom, great deal (sort-of), works great (after I deleted 2 mysterious old unknown wifi connections)I bought this for my mom, she was always having Windows problems, viruses disguised as virus removal, scammy pop-ups, and so on.  Happy day!  :DThey raised prices during Prime Day, wth?  I thought I was getting a good deal, but afterward I noticed the price went down.  Anyway, I ordered this for my mom.  She's been using Windows and I wanted her to experience a Macbook Pro.  This one is actually even better than mine!  I'm still happily using a Late 2013 2.4 Ghz 8 RAM 256 GB 13-inch Retina, her's is exactly the same except it's a Early 2015 and it's actually got 2.7 Ghz!  Anyway she seems really happy with it.  I set it up for her, and ran the serial number, which was not found, not surprisingly although I'm not sure what that means, and the update page in the App Store looks like it was coded in 1995, so I'm not sure what's up with that.  Could be something funky going on, but all I know is it works and we're happy with it.  She's getting used to using it, and she says it's fast and smooth.  She was getting tired of all the Windows updates and virus stuff and all the spammy popups telling her to purchase a virus disguised as virus removal, yadda yadda yadda, so I am well-pleased that she is now almost a full-blown Mac-head.  Thanks Apple.  I hope to be able to afford an Apple car when they do come out, haha.  I'm not sure about the battery-life yet, but I HAD TO replace the battery on mine, so replacing it on hers should not be a problem."
432,It’s just one continuous problem after the other with this computer. It’s really not worth it to save a little bit of money just buy new not refurbished have your warrantee you’re better off in the long run.
433,For this being my first ever Mac- This was an amazing buy... no scratches or dents. Its basically BRAND NEW. 😝😝😝The only thing is that it says 512gb but the space says 256gb so be wary of that.But other than that I am really happy with my purchase.
434,Good
435,Love it
436,"the product arrived with the screen broken. I would like a refund of $ 400 to repair it, since he is now in Brazil."
437,So happy with this purchase. Even my kids said it looks like the new ones. Has some minor imperfections but at the cost totally acceptable. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.
438,"I purchased through amazon this m1 chip 512 gb 8ram macbook pro 2020 year manufacture.  I’m a mac user of many years.  The computer is blazing fast, slim, light with great battery life. A huge bonus—-little need for additional  anti virus add on software since the macbook anti virus platform is very solid. A hidden gem when you buy any apple device is phenomenal tech telephone support.  The advisors at the apple stores and by telephone are the best part of the apple experience for me and even rival the devices they sell. Yes, I hate the high prices and know the game but over time I’ve  accepted their price points because of the incredible tech support."
439,battery would not take any charge  stuck at 1%
440,"I cannot believe the condition my Macbook is in, you can’t even tell if it’s used and the packaging was very nice and professional with the white box and wrapped just like it is when you get it directly from Apple. I am super happy with my purchase, thanks Amazon."
441,"Good, but it is a little small.. easy to control. Recommend if you are hard to control your computer"
442,Computer will not charge.
443,"""Refurbished"" even though Battery life was non existent from the startup, always check the reviews on laptops to make sure they have over 200, cause then you won't be played by greedy ass people like I was"
444,"Minor scratches , for the price reduction is a great buy !!!"
445,Light weight
446,"El producto reacibdiocionado en muy buen estado, funciona perfectamente y venía totalmente protegido y embalado. Muy satisfecho con la compra"
447,"Looks and acts brand new. Everything exactly as advertised. Will update if I have any issues but after a week I can say, I am pleasantly surprised!"
448,"This is an unusually large advance over previous models, especially in raw computing power, but also in fun things like screen and headphone support.This Amazon listing has two different processors, the M1 Pro (listed as 16-Core GPU ""style"") and the M1 Max (32-Core GPU). I'll call one the Pro, the other the Max. I got the base Pro, but much of what I'll say applies to both, and I'll have some comments specifically about the Max too. (MBP below = MacBook Pro.)Amazon doesn't offer most of the options you can get, only the ones listed. For now (and probably later), that's the Pro with 16GB RAM and 512GB or 1TB SSD, or the Max with 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD. 3 versions total.Screen Brightness* and HappinessThis screen can get up to 1600 nits brightness and can sustain full-screen brightness up to 1000. That's very impressive, as MBPs since 2016 have topped out at 500.*But the vast majority of the time, this screen will also top out at 500, because those other numbers are only for HDR (high dynamic range, what Apple calls XDR), i.e. some videos and some photos viewed in some programs. If you're browsing the internet, using productivity apps, or the like, those are almost all SDR (standard dynamic range). You'll be seeing them at the same brightness as with MBPs for the last five years.That said, the new screen is beautiful and bright in both HDR and SDR for most situations. For HDR, it puts out more color and brightness, and darker blacks - a million-to-one contrast ratio - with a wider range of light and color that has more pop and more detail in shadows and highlights. It can be dazzling or just more realistic.For SDR, it's much like before, still a gorgeous screen, with better contrast than before because of darker blacks.Has more pixels per inch (254, up from 226), and more pixels all over (3456 by 2234, up from 3072 by 1920). The aspect ratio remains 16:10 (not counting the top menu bar).ProMotionProMotion is Apple's name for screen refresh rates that can go up to 120Hz, or lower to save processor/battery power when 120 isn't needed. This makes motion smoother, more natural.For now where ProMotion applies is limited. Most scrolling in browsing, including with Safari, still tops out at 60Hz. Which is fine for me, but it bothers some people, looks choppy to them. This could be changed with a software update.Bloom and GhostsBloom is when a bright spot on a dark background bleeds out past where it's supposed to be, a common issue with this kind of screen. I and most others think this screen handles it well (better than the iPad Pro), but it can still arise some.Ghosting is when a moving object leaves a noticeable trail of ghost images behind for a fraction of a second, one for each new frame until the old image fades. MBPs are notoriously mediocre at this kind of ghostbusting, and this screen is no exception. Expect the usual haunting, if you notice that kind of thing.PWMFor those concerned (you mostly know who you are), there is PWM (pulse-width modulation) on the smaller 14"" version of this screen, and so very likely on this one too, at a frequency of 14,880Hz at all brightness levels (measured by NotebookCheck). That's a very high frequency, considered well beyond what would cause trouble for the susceptible.The NotchAs you can see in the main photo here, there's a black Notch at the top of the screen. There are no pixels there. The long-desired improved camera is there, and a mic array and light sensor (and maybe room for a Face ID system if they decide to make MBPs with that). As with the iPhone Notch, it's controversial.You can make the Notch disappear, or rather blend in, if you make the background up there black. It also disappears into the black bars when you view things like videos in full-screen mode.The cursor disappears into the Notch if you put it there. If an app has menu items that stretch there, they disappear too, but they'll still function normally if you put the (invisible) cursor on them.Desperate times call for desperate measures. Most apps won't have this trouble, but if you must, you can avoid menu items disappearing by using the ""Scale to fit"" function, which shrinks the entire screen work area a little to fit below the Notch. Makes it look like an old 15"" if the background is black, like there are wide black bezels. (Google ""Scale to fit below built-in camera"" for full instructions and mockery.)There are also third-party apps, such as Bartender, to manage how items appear in the menu bar and keep them visible.Camera and MicsThe new camera that, along with the thinner bezels, makes the Notch necessary, is 1080p, with an f/2 lens for good exposure in the shadows. Video looks noticeably better than before, though it can have a processed look.The three mics sound very clean and natural but with a little less bass than before to my ears, which is fine.Extra ScreensYou can use two external monitors with the Pro, down from four with previous models. They can be up to 6K @60Hz with a billion colors. The Max can still use four: three 6K and one 4K, all @60Hz etc.You can use 4K @120/144Hz HDR monitors too.You can run two from one port if you use the right kind of dock or daisy-chain.Headphone OomphThe new headphone jack has more power for high-impedance headphones. It automatically adjusts, so it won't overwhelm low-impedance phones. If the headphones have less than 150 ohms impedance, they get 1.25 volts RMS. If more, 3 volts. That might cause it to fail to provide enough power to some not-so-high-impedance headphones that still require extra power, such as planars.With my 2016 15"" MBP, I've had to use a portable amp for my Beyerdynamic DT 1990 Pros (250 ohm), but now I can pretty well do without it, though sometimes only just. The volume on some sources is still not always what I wish I could make it. But now I can nearly achieve hearing loss with the intro to the guitar riff in ""Money for Nothing."" Which also sounds good, and healthier, a couple notches down.Among other headphones that have tested favorably with the new jack are the DT 990 Pros (250 ohm), and the Sennheiser HD650, 660S, 6XX, and HD800 (150 to 300 ohm).One report says the planar Hifiman HE4XXs (35 ohm planar) sound good, but most planars tested are said to need more power. The Audeze LCD-2Cs are reported to sound good enough, though not their best. The LCD-3s and Hifiman Sundaras and Aryas are said to be underpowered.For my usual regular-impedance phones, Cleer Flow IIs (16 ohm), the wired volume is a little louder than before, though still not always the earsplitting barrage I want for some sources. Maybe for the best.Quality iems (in-ear monitors) that require especially clean input, but not too much, reportedly sound good, including Andromedas and Moondrop Starfields.SpeakersThey're improved from the already laptop-leading speakers from earlier MBPs, with a fuller sound and decent kick, amazingly good for when nothing with a 3"" woofer is around.Apple mysteriously says the 14"" M1 has the same speaker system, but looking inside both machines shows the speakers in the 16"" are bigger - both ""subs"" and tweeters - and located differently, with the subs in the front corners on this one. The 16"" has fuller bass (such as it is).Heat and NoiseThere isn't any.None with my typical use, at least. If you push it hard, it can get warm, but not as hot as my 2016 15"". Which makes sense, as this has a larger enclosure, bigger fans, larger, better heat sinks, and more power-efficient processors. The fans don't have to spin up as much to do the same amount of cooling, so it's noticeably quieter even when it does heat up, rarely makes any noise at all.The 16"" Max comes with a larger heat sink than the 16"" Pro, so likely runs a little cooler and quieter sometimes, though the Max might get hotter when it uses a lot of that extra power.KeyboardVery quiet, much like the older Mac laptop keyboards, not the butterfly ones from 2015-19, but the rest. Maybe less travel in the keys than some of those, but plenty for me.I miss the touch bar sliders for fine control of some functions, but you can still use sliders via the Control Center, the icon next to the date on the screen's top menu bar. That's also where control of the keyboard backlight is, no more control for it on the keyboard.TouchpadThe best available by far, responsive and large so you can carry the cursor over a large area with more control. For clicks, it's great. For taps, which I turn off, it's not as great, according to those who prefer that - appears to be a software issue.PortsThere's one less Thunderbolt/USB-C port than before, but 50% more bandwidth (3 controllers instead of 2).The HDMI is 2.0, can drive up to 4K HDR @60Hz.The SD card reader is shallow, so the cards stick out. There might be room for a flush micro-SD adapter. I only have cards up to 64GB, which work fine. Some people have had trouble reading some cards, so it may be finicky.Battery LifeI usually keep plugged in, but the reviews I've seen that cover battery life tests typically say it's the longest of any similar machine they've tested, including PCs. Reports of battery life for office work, browsing, watching videos, and so on generally range from 10 to 16 hours, sometimes more. It can go unusually long with heavy use too, 5 hours or more of video work, for example. Max Tech did 10 benchmark and stress tests with it in a couple hours, some maxing out the CPU or GPU for up to ten minutes, and it still had 36% left.At normal settings, there's no performance hit until you get down to 3%; until then you can process or game at full tilt. There's a low-power mode that extends battery life by limiting performance, lowering screen brightness, etc. The Max also has a high-power mode, but it seems to only ramp up the fans sooner to help cooling. Apple's description and tests in reviews indicate it doesn't affect performance in any direct way.The Max has tended to have a little less battery life than the Pro in reviews. The only good tests I've seen that compared directly either found negligible differences or up to 15% less battery life for the Max. (Other tests haven't been well controlled.)You can quick charge to 50% in a half-hour. The new power brick is 45% more powerful than before, and maybe 30% larger lengthwise, still small for what it does. You can charge at lower speed with smaller bricks (not included) via the USB-C ports.Size and WeightIt's noticeably heavier than before, about 5 ounces over the previous 16"", and not quite as sleek, but it's sleeker than I was expecting from the photos.RepairabilityHa ha! But really, it's better than it was. Battery modules now have pull tabs so they can be more easily replaced. The screen can be replaced more easily, but if Apple doesn't do it you lose True Tone (which I don't want anyway). The headphone, Thunderbolt and MagSafe ports can be replaced without replacing the logic board. Now rates a 4/10 from iFixit for repairability, up from 1/10 for the previous model.CompatibilityComes with Rosetta 2, which enables M1 Macs to use programs written for Intel Macs, and usually works very well.There's no more Boot Camp, so to run Windows or Windows programs you have to use third-party software like Parallels, which runs Windows by emulating a Windows machine (and requires a Windows license), or Crossover, which modifies Windows programs to run on Macs.  Which works best, or at all, depends on the program.GamingWoW *mostly* runs 50 to 120fps at high settings and resolution, depending on the location. Some places can't even manage 50 at those settings, though, but do OK at more compromised settings. Baldur's Gate 3, Diablo III, CS:GO and several others can run at 60-100fps or better at good settings.You can play Windows games via Parallels or Crossover. They generally don't run as well, but some do fine.Most games, including native ones, run quite a bit better on the Max, with up to 2x the fps. Final Fantasy XIV is hit and miss at good settings even with the Max.Gaming isn't usually hot or noisy, can get warmer with light fans for the games that aren't running natively. And there's no noticeable performance hit for gaming on battery.WorkI have to mention the less fun part: how well this does things you might have to do at work. It does almost all of it better than before, much of it way better. Here's how it compares according to actual test results from numerous sources with Xcode, Logic Pro, Lightroom, Blender, Final Cut Pro, Premiere Pro, and so on. The range of comparison depends on what the task is.Previous base MBP 16"" (Intel i7 AMD 5300): The Pro is 60% to several times faster.Previous top-spec'd MBP (i9 5600M): The Pro is about the same to 2 or 3 times faster.Regular M1 machines (not M1 Pro or Max): The Pro is about the same to several times faster.The 14"" M1 Pro with same specs: The same, though the 16"" has the bigger battery and heat removal system, so it fares better in those ways.Windows laptop work stations: This is complicated, but the Pro can thrash most Windows laptops in most intensive work-related apps. It lines up very roughly with machines with a good i7/i9 and an RTX 3070, but generally can't keep up with the RTX 3080. The Pro uses a fraction of the power, and so only produces a fraction of the heat and noise, if any. And lasts and performs much better on battery.Pro vs MaxThe Max is about the same to twice as fast as the Pro, mostly between those extremes. The CPU is much the same, but the GPU is double the cores, so the main advantage is in graphics-heavy work.Besides the GPU cores, the Max has twice the bandwidth for memory transfer, two hardware video encode engines instead of one, and some extra cooling capacity.If you're already successfully using a Mac laptop, you don't *need* the Max, since the Pro is already better than what you have. But that doesn't mean you can't benefit from the Max's extra power if you have the money. For intensive video editing, massive photo editing, or better gaming (though cheaper Windows machines will play most games better), the Max has real advantages.To confuse things a little more, Apple (but not Amazon currently) also offers a demi-Max with a 24-core GPU, halfway between the Pro's 16 and the Max's 32. It's a cheaper way to get the extra bandwidth, video encoder, and cooling advantages of the Max. Tests show that in graphics-intensive tasks it operates roughly midway between the Pro and 32-core Max, often more than half, as expected.WarrantiesThis comes with a one-year limited warranty against manufacturing defects that includes free phone support for the first 90 days. If you want to also cover accidental damage (with deductibles) and extend the regular warranty and free tech support to 3 years, you can buy 

AppleCare+ from Amazon

   (link embedded) or Apple. You get 60 days from purchase to buy it, but coverage for accidents doesn't start until you do. (I always self-insure when I can, so I didn't get it.)DecalsLast and least, this comes with two black Apple decals, the sign of true professional Apple equipment."
449,Out of the box unusable for me. This MacBook Pro does not have any USB ports to be able to restore from a previous Mac back up that’s on an external drive. You must buy an adapter. Since I live in a remote area I’d have to order online and wait. You cannot even plug a iPhone12 Pro Max directly into it. The only ports it has are thunderbolt. So even Apple’s own lighting connector needs an adapter. The keyboard is a downgrade from the old keyboard. Solid black plastic instead of plastic keys surrounded by aluminum which were easier to see. Had to call Apple support to download an update because there is no reset option in the System Preferences of OS Monterey. And the update did not work to give it that option. Will have to figure out a different option to remove my account and information to return it. This particular MacBook is defective I believe.
450,I ordered the 2021 16 inch right away as I knew they would probably sell out fast. I had to make sure I had one for my trip I am leaving on soon.  As soon as I opened it the screen would never come on.  Thought maybe it needed charging so I tried that.  Still nothing but a black screen.  It kept making the sound when you open it up even when it was closed over and over again.  I took it to the local Apple Store hoping I could get some answers.  They tired to get it to work and could not either.  They said it is very strange and maybe something happened to it during shipping.  They said since it is brand new it would be best to get my money back from Amazon.  I thought maybe I could just exchange it before my trip but the one I ordered is out of stock.  I will try the 14 inch and see if I like it compared to the size of the 16 inch since it is in stock.  This is a first MacBook Pro I have ever purchased and now I am a bit nervous.
451,"Here are the temperature results for the new cool MacBooks compared to the old overheating intel ones. 91 degrees for the old one near the processor, and 74 degrees on the new ones. Both had been running for hours transferring files nonstop. Amazing. I have been editing video, transferring large files and not once have the fans kicked on. Makes me want to cry."
452,"Finally, this 2021 MacBook Pro cured my depression!"
453,Arrived DOA - wouldn’t start up. Spent hours on the phone with Apple support and still wouldn’t start. Returned - c’mon man!
454,"This laptop is unbelievably fast. Between the screen, battery life, and performance, this laptop is head and shoulders better than any competition."
455,My first ever MacBook. Switched over from PC and I can't believe I didn't switch sooner! On the pricer side but I'm super happy with my purchase!
456,"I have been using my MacBook Pro from 2014 for work until last week when I finally purchased this MacBook Pro. My old MacBook starts up and works as fast as the day I bought it. The only reason I bought a new MacBook was because the battery life was getting low. I probably could have just bought a new battery and it would have been fine.That being said, I did hold out for this MacBook because Apple brought back the ports that I needed. I use the HDMI and SD ports daily. An Ethernet port would have been nice but that’s asking too much. This MacBook has a 2 day battery life and is blazing fast. I use Adobe programs and this MacBook doesn’t even blink when I do live editing. Best laptop I have ever used.I own a business that uses many PC laptops and a couple MacBooks. A PC will never last as long as a MacBook. And, a PC ALWAYS gets slower after 6 months of use. The price is high but you can buy a new PC every 2 years or a MacBook every 7 years."
457,"Coming from a 2019 16in, I feel that this generation is 2 steps forwards, 1 step back.Pros:-Fans are never audible even under full extended load!  This was my #1 issue with my 2019 mac which would have constant fan noise with 2 monitors.-2x battery life-Better screen especially in dark environment or a dark subject-Extremely fast for certain workloads such as video editing and code compilation.-magsafe is back (although I personally don't care for it)-most apps work normally with rosetta emulation, but may have some stutter.Cons:-thicker and SIGNIFICANTLY heavier.-Screen has a notch which is very distracting for me.-Still has some compatibility issues.-Terrible for games.  Only a few titles are supported natively.  I only tested league of legends(uses rosetta emulator), but it was choppy and 1/3 the fps of my 2019 intel macbook.- +$300 base price even though they got rid of intel.-The area I feel apple has made a major misstep is with ports.  I couldn't care less for SD card or HDMI, but everyone who buys this is going to need USB-A.  It's ridiculous that I still have to bring a dongle everywhere just to use my mouse but these ports I never/rarely use are back.Also some developer related tools/libraries aren't working.C# debugger is totally unsupported for example.  Anything that requires gpu hardware acceleration (pytorch) is unlikely to ever be supported in any usable form.  Linux dual boot is unsupported or in early experimental stages.  I also had issues building/running java projects natively, but no issues with rosetta.If you're looking to buy this for an undergrad program, it's probably workable.  However, I'd suggest saving some $ and getting a used mac or windows machine.  Professional devs will be aware of their specific requirements, but I suspect many will need to keep a secondary x86 machine for the foreseeable future."
458,"I am writing this review focused primarily on people who are considering jumping from the 13"" MacBook Pro to the 14"" MacBook Pro, which is what I did. I moved from the 13"" MacBook Pro M1 with 16gb of RAM to the 14"" MacBook Pro M1 Pro with 16gb of RAM.Size: So, 1"" of screen might not seem like a lot on its face, but the difference is pretty substantial, in my opinion. Even the pictures don't quite do it justice. The screen feels considerably larger in a package that isn't considerably larger. For me, it's the perfect sweet spot for someone who wants something larger than the 13"" model, but smaller than the 16"". I had a 16"" MacBook Pro i9 and it was just too much for me. This one feels perfect.Form Factor: The new 14"" and 16"" MacBooks both adopt a thicker chassis, which is shown in the pictures. As such, Apple decided to make the casing flat instead of gently rounded. It honestly reminds me of the pre-unibody builds, but still sleek and modern. If I didn't know this one was new and you just laid them side-by-side, I might say that the old form factor looks a little newer, but that isn't to say that it looks bad.Aesthetics: Overall, I touched on the aesthetics a bit in the ""form factor"" section. It looks like a high-end laptop, but at the same time I can see some people thinking it looks dated. I personally like the flatter look over the more rounded look, but it will depend on the person. Another thing I like is moving the ""MacBook Pro"" branding from under the screen to the bottom of the casing. I just think it provides a cleaner look during use. The black background of the keyboard is also a plus for me. The old space gray background was fine, but I really like the black.Function: Most people probably won't notice a massive difference in the previous iteration and the new iteration. For the 14"" and 16"" MacBook Pros, the touchbar has been removed. This will make a lot of people happy. For me, I was always pretty ambivalent about the touchbar, but I'm not going to complain about a key row there. The keyboard appears to have ever so slightly more travel and bounce. It's not a huge amount, but it is noticeable. I'll touch on The Notch later.Performance: My 13"" had the M1 chip and now my 14"" as the M1 Pro. So far, I haven't noticed a tremendous difference when using programs like Logic Pro, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Lightroom, but I wouldn't say those are super intensive programs. If you're exporting massive 8K videos, you might want to jump up to the M1 Max. One thing I have noticed is that the thermals are maybe a little bit worse. Just a touch. I have noticed it warming up a bit, but the fan still has not come on once. I only mention this because my 13"" M1 stayed cold at all times. It's not as bad as my i9, which sounded like a jet engine revving up while it jumped well over 100 degrees, but it's something to be aware of.The Notch: Honestly, so much has been made of the notch and I think it's mostly overstated. Yes, it's fun to meme the fact that Apple still hasn't found a way around the notch, particularly on iPhones, but it's really not a huge deal. Were it up to me, I would have just left a bezel up there, but I can understand why Apple didn't. I use a Dell XPS for work and it has razor thin bezels with no notch, but at the same time the camera is an absolute joke. Looks like it's from 2002.The Notch (cont'd): The notch behavior can be inconsistent from app to app, but not to the point where it's bothersome. I have seen some programs with very large nav menus up top bump the status bar out of the way to make room. And while this particular phenomenon is not something new for MacBooks, losing a big chunk of that bar to the notch will likely make this a more regular occurrence for people. Do I wish it didn't have a notch? Yeah, probably. Does it hurt the experience? Very, very little.Screen: For everyday indoor use, which is almost exclusively what I do, I think you will be hard-pressed to find a better screen on the market. The 120Hz refresh rate is something I waited a long time to get on the iPhone, so I was pretty shocked to see it implemented on the new MacBook Pros just a month later. It actually has more pixels/inch than the iMac 27"" 5K screen, which I also use pretty regularly. All-in-all, the screen is just the best in the business.Overall: It's a great and powerful laptop for someone who is wanting a little more than web surfing and word processing. I use mine primarily for recording music, as well as live performances using standalone plugins, so I need something that is powerful and easy to use. The MacBook Pro has always fit the bill, but now with the M1, M1 Pro, and M1 Max chips, I have absolutely no concern for performance or consistency.My 13"" M1 did just what I needed in this regard, but I'm someone who wanted a slightly larger screen without drastically increasing my footprint and weight. The 14"" MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip is just what I needed. If you're someone who needs absolutely top notch performance, I'd recommend upgrading the RAM and going with the M1 Max."
459,"I haven't upgraded my computer for more than a decade, so it would stand to reason any recent releases would impress me, but this macbook pro has gone above and beyond in the small time I've had it.The screen is truly something to behold. Smooth, clear, just beautiful. I don't typically care about bezels, but I might start. The expanded screen makes an unexpected difference. Meanwhile, I barely notice the notch. Apple said they'd find workarounds to make it scarce, and they have.The speakers are wonderful as well. I was skeptical at first -- thought I caught some tinny effects on a couple songs, but the more I listen to them, the more I'm convinced the tinniness was in the recording (it was a live album, which might explain it). As for the spatial audio, I've only heard a couple songs, but it's pretty trippy. This is my first experience with it, and it doesn't disappoint.In the short time I've had the computer, it's been nothing but fast. Probably more computer than I need, so if you're a sound editor or photographer, this review probably isn't for you. But for those of you casual users who want a solid machine that will last (as I said, my last macbook pro made it more than a decade), this is the one. Excited as I was for my last macbook, I could see room for improvement at the time. Right now, I don't see how things get better than this."
460,"M1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. Compared to previous MacBook Pro, it's a giant leap ahead. These tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the Macbook. This particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro,  but it still kicks butt. You can get the Pro Max chip and bump up the RAM to 64GB if you want - and add tons more storage. The 14 inch MacBook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. It can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. The display is stunning. Just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. The brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. Real HDR viewing -  a big difference. You will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. After 10 minutes I don't even notice it. It means nothing for your experience. Its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. Camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous MacBooks. Six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. Music/movies it feels like surround sound. For video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. The keyboard is a dream to type on. Very solid like all MacBooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. The Apple Magic Keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. Battery life is amazing. I have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. At best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! Especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it won't be 17 hours but I did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. The power efficiency is ground breaking. They have added back the MagSafe power plug - which is great! And added back an SD card slot and and an HDMI port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. I wish it had at least one USB-A old style port - but it doesn't. You get three USB-C thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. They got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro MacBooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. Apparently they listened to a lot of users who didn't really like the touch pad. The shape and style of this laptop is great. Some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. That is BS. I have been typing most of the day and I don't feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. Very comfy for typing. Some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new Macbook Pro, but I am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside -  this is an amazing laptop - the best Apple has ever made, hands down. And I would say you won't find a better power laptop anywhere.  All that said - this is not a gamers machine. Apple is not for hard core gamers. I mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. I am a hard core gamer and a PC geek  - I have a powerful windows PC for gaming. And always will. But for everything else. this MacBook is king. I use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. I can plut into a giant monitor if I want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch IPS panel. So if you are wondering if this Macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - I am here to tell you, its the real deal. I finally upgraded from my 2015 MacBook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. If you are thinking of getting one - you won't be disappointed. One last comment. I am an old timer windows guy, and I know all the counter arguments for the Mac. Many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. First, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new M1 Pro chips - you can't. And aside from that, the Mac OS is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text FROM A PHOTO! Whaaat? And the design/ergonomics/quality of these MacBooks is unmatched. So, yes you pay more - but you get more. My last MacBook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. If you want this laptop - get it! It rocks."
461,"I have a Mabook Pro covered by Apple care. The computer needs a new battery. To make a long story short Apple left me for months with a computer, again under warranty, which I can use for a couple of hours for simple tasks like web browsing before it needs to be recharged. Apple refused to replace the battery because the diagnostic read 81% not below 80 % as per policy. In all this Apple didn’t have any problems asking me to invest countless hours of my time between doing clean installs trips to apple stores etc.. I feel a more respectful way to treat me as a loyal customer could have been let us replace the battery first and if that doesn’t fix the issue which I seriously doubt ask me to do troubleshooting. All this to save something that would probably cost you few $$. Seriously ?"
462,sent me base model
463,"I probably got a faulty laptop but the charger status doesn’t show it’s charging when plugged in, only thing indicating that it’s charging is the orange light. My chrome windows keeps crashing whenever I put the computer to sleep and the external video display rarely connects"
464,"I never write reviews, but feel compelled to write one for this Macbook Pro. I've owned macs consistently since 1990s and have dealt with eye strain on the air and now on this laptop. It gave me horrible headaches and eye strain even with a matte protector. I returned it and am now looking at PCs for the first time because if I can't read from the screen without it making me sick, I can't use it."
465,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   My first MacBook ever! I had been saving up for it before the official drop— & I was not disappointed! Love the Touch ID feature, and it’s so efficient! Can’t wait to use it when I go back to school!"
466,"This laptop has a superior display, superior speakers, superior camera and an excellent keyboard. Don't go cheap and buy the ""affordable"" MacBook Air base model like some of these talking heads have been advising. It's not a good buy if you are unhappy with it after six months, and believe me, you will be unhappy with 8 GB of RAM and two USB ports after six months. M1 MacBooks are not upgradeable so if you find that you need more RAM, you are stuck. Unless all you are doing sending emails, tweets, and watching TicTok, you will probably need something more, especially if you are using your laptop for work. I'm using my MacBook Pro with an LG UltraFine 5K 27 inch display as my desktop system, which replaces a 27 inch iMac. I'm very happy."
467,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Sheeeese! What can I say? Apple has done it again 🤪😍 magnificent piece of device I must say."
468,"I pulled the trigger on this thing hoping that the bad reviews were wrong.. some of the comments saying it came dirty and defective definitely gave me pause however, what arrived today was practically a brand new macbook. the device does not show any signs of wear and the battery cycle count is 18, it came with the original power brick and while the cable was used, it was not worn or dirty in any way. While i've only just started using the device about an hour ago, I can tell you that it's speedy and works flawlessly... had I not known it was a refurb when buying it, I would have easily confused it for a brand new mbp.. for those asking, this is a 2017 macbook pro and the specs as quoted are accurate. i'll play around with this thing for a little while and update this review as needed, but so far this looks like a winner!***update***A few months in and it’s still working flawlessly. I don’t regret my purchase for one second, and neither should you!"
469,This is not a 256GB MacBook Pro- they are falsely advertising it as such and then shipping buyers 128GB versions.
470,"Came in used and dirty, and it was not even turn off, I'm gonna return it. So disappointed."
471,"Wow. I cant say enough how happy I am with this laptop! I it arrived early, and for a refurbished computer I swear it doesn't have a scratch, dent, smudge or single flaw anywhere on it! Its fast, the battery is great, its working perfectly! I couldn't be happier with this thing!"
472,"Was excited to receive it and on the outside it had one noticable chip in the case on the cover side (which had a sharp edge to it), but thought that isn't too bad.  But when opening it up the screen in both the top left and top right were broken/chipped/cracked like it had been dropped and they replaced the cover, but not the screen.  This was not acceptable.  Wanted to try it out and ended up learning that some of the keys did not work right (sticky, pushed strange and such), plus the touchpad/mouse was really strange and didn't seem to work correctly.  Too many issues out of the box for me and too concerned that there might be other issues from where it looked to have been dropped and such.  Sending it back and just started that process.  So far the return seems ok....but just hate that the product does not match the description...using their words ""Renewed products work and look like new""."
473,"I ordered the space gray with 256 gb of ram and received a silver with 128gb.  I knew this could happen as the picture did not match the description and I had seen other similar reviews.The good news is it was on time and in flawless condition.  I think I will stick with it and not press my luck, as it is still a fair price and a great machine, but beware."
474,"I have to admit, I don't typically write reviews and I was a little hesistant about the product due to some 1 to two star reviews. The space gray model not only is at a great price, it came to me brand new. With all the specs I was expecting, i5 8GB RAM 256GB SSD, and works like a dream. Battery life is great, setting up was easy, and all my Apple Products (iPhone, Apple watch, Earpods) synced with no issues. I'm not sure as to why there were so many negative reviews, but mine is not one of them. SO HAPPY!! I truly recommend."
475,the battery is dead
476,"This product arrived quickly and looked great.  There have been multiple glitches with the power switch and with the screen ever since it's arrival.  Most of the time the power button would require multiple attempts to push before the computer would power up.  When the computer woke from sleep state (opening lid after its been closed for at least fifteen minutes) the screen would be black and then all pixelated.  Most recently, the computer wouldn't even turn on, when it finally did, it was all reset and all the settings were reset.  I lost everything I had put on the computer over the past day.  The seller still hasn't gotten back to me after email and I left a voice message.  I have now initiated a return as I want my money back.  It would have been nice if they had gotten back to me ASAP when I emailed or when I called (during normal hours of operation, by the way) and it went to voicemail.  The fact that they didn't and the computer kept coming up with other issues.  I now will buy a new one.  The value is not there with the aggravation generated."
477,"Multiple reviews mentioned getting devices with used batteries, screen issues, etc.My laptop arrived through FedEx Express with questionable packaging. But everything was intact and fine. The laptop still had the plastic wrapped around it as MacBooks directly from Apple do, even with the screen cover. Only 3 battery cycles out of the box, with a new charger in the box. I am very satisfied with the purchase although in the Q&A section of this product someone mentions that this is a 2018 model, its not, its a 2017 (At least the one I received.) which for me isn't really a big deal since it arrived in exceptional condition. Highly recommend this MacBook."
478,I'm a fan of apple products and I like almost everything about this new MBA. But it has one huge flaw that nobody talks about. It's the camera hardware and it hasn't been updated in ages. My zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light. A $1000 laptop with 10 year old front camera is unacceptable. Camera is very important to me. Especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time.
479,"Liked:- Long battery life (one charge WILL last all day, i.e. 16 hours. Personally tested true)- Speed (the new M1 processor really is fast)- Quiet (no fan but the laptop still does not get hot)- Light and portable- High resolution & bright displayDisliked:- As with other MacBooks, the keyboard is mediocre especially compared to laptops like Lenovo Thinkpad- Incompatible applications (With the M1 processor still being new, you might experience existing programs frequently crash. For example, Chrome keeps crashing) But I would guess there will be a fix soon"
480,"UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable.The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long.Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using ""swap memory"" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board.***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB.I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models.There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD.***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly.------I purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12"" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1.The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco.I likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive ""Pro Apps"" running at the same time.I would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.I would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball ""not responding"" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1. If however, you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable, faster and cooler running than the Intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable Mac."
481,"The M1 chip really is amazing. But it only lasted five days for me. Somehow mine managed to break after using a third party USB C hub. The screen wouldn’t turn on at all, and an Apple repair tech couldn’t figure it out after doing a few quick tests. Oh and then Apple said it would take a month to replace it with a new one."
482,"Beautiful laptop. I’ve upgraded from the MacBook Air of old...so far this laptop has blown it away. It wasn’t overly pricey to be honest and I feel it’s worth the price. Overall look is great and keyboard feel is nice. Larger touchpad is great, I’ve paired my Magic Trackpad 2 with it as well."
483,"I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13"" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13"" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.Good:- SCREEN looks great!  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  I usually don't go above 50% brightness.- KEYBOARD is good.  Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard.  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic.  Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great.  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.- LOOKS GREAT.  Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.- NO FAN.  That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.- PERFORMANCE.  It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time.  For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU.  Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27"" (top end) with Intel chips.- TOUCH ID is great still.  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons.  On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA.  Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch).  You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay.  And so on and so forth.- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.NOT GOOD:- WEBCAM still sucks.  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc.  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27"" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera).- ONLY 2 PORTS.  Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort).  Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame.  I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.OVERALL:A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem.  Love it so far!"
484,No complains so far.  Very fast and performs great.  I had a 2014 MacBook Air and finally upgraded this year.  This is leagues beyond that entry and I’m very happy with this upgrade.
485,"Lightweight, blazing fast, easy to use, battery life is incredible with the new Apple M1 chip.  A typical Great Apple product.However, there is only a Thunderbolt port, so you now have to go out and buy a cable to convert USB to thunderbolt (if you want to use a backup hard drive) or other USB items, AND, I had to buy yet another cable to sync my phone's lightning port to the thunderbolt port on the computer. Total $56.I LOVE Apple product, and worked for them in my caerer, but I would wait on buying this version until the software for it has been developed.UPDATE: After several months of using this computer, I have have found several things of concern:1.  my notification center keeps disappearing, despite my constant reinstalling the widgets.2.  my computer's calendar, reminders, and photo stream do not sync with my IOS devices (iPhone & iPad).  If I add an item to calendar on my phone, it will appear on my mac but not vice versa.  Reminders will not sync regardless of which device I originate the item on.I have contacted Apple support on all these issues and they cannot solve the problem.IT APPEARS THAT THE BUGS HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED OUT, YET.  THINGS ARE MADDENINGLY CLUNKY!"

   Bought this laptop bc i needed it for spring semester and i needed an upgrade from my heavy macbook pro. I go to work too so i needed something super light and thin i can just bring everywhere and slide it in my bag.I am obsessed with how fast this macbook is. The battery life is on point. I used it for movies and series at work and it lasted for 3 days. The processor is definitely sooo good. I open so many tabs at once and it has not lagged on me. The keyboard and trackpad is responsive.I love the color. The main reason why i bought this too. 😍😂I have no problems with it at all.Highly recommend"
487,Opened my brand new $1000++ computer and the entire screen was cracked and destroyed. Awesome! Thanks Amazon.
488,"Delivered to me within 12 hours of purchase... Sealed in original apple packaging with protective film, blemish free, not a scratch.. Mint.its powerful, Ive already loaded some big task audio software and broadcast software on it and its flying through the multiple processes together at ease... (Logic 10.5 / Traktor DJ 3.0 / OBS)Super light and portable, If this is a MacBook Pro then I can't even imagine how light the Air models are. Nor could I even imagine why you may need something more powerful. I am having to adjust to the new keyboard and Touch Bar, I keep hitting Siri and volume settings, even as I type this.id also recommend getting a keyboard cover as well.... I hear these keyboards go out sometimes and to repair it. This is no fault to the reseller, but I can't believe Apple with their price points don't offer a bigger SSD for the lowest price point.... 128gb is laughable so be prepared to buy an external SSD along with a Thunderbolt 3 / USB-C Hub to run hdmi, and various external accessories.Overall I love this computer so far, it was a nail biter as I rarely ever shell out $1,000 on anything but I'm very pleased and satisfied with my purchase. And I still cannot find a better deal on the internet, not even used on Facebook marketplace, letgo or craigslist....Five stars"
489,So not worth it. All they want to do is take your money do NOT BUY THIS ONE! Its used and if you search apple on amazon they have brand new with higher stats for cheaper.
490,"Just received this, but so far so good. It looks BRAND NEW. There are literally NO signs of cosmetic wear or damage. It arrived in a sealed apple box. I’m finishing setting up and I already love it. For just under $1,200 for a 2019 model, this is a GREAT deal!"
491,"I really love my MacBook. I really love this laptop. I'm a huge MacBook fan and this works like new. So far I don't have a problem with the butterfly keyboard, but I heard bad reviews about the keyboard from watching YouTube videos. I think that they may have fixed the keyboard problem when they refurbished the product??? I'm not sure, but honestly this a really great laptop for a really great price. I do wish that it came in the original Apple box and packaging, but it wasn't far from the really deal."
492,"It looks and feels brand spanking new! Definitely happy with my purchase considering that I bought a brand new 2020 MacBook Air and hated it. Returned it back in 2 days. I paid a lot less for the Pro than the Air and its A LOT better with so many features. I’m not trying to persuade anyone out of getting the Air but if you are considering on buying a MacBook my advice would be to just go ahead and get the pro. The Air reminds me of a google chrome book slapped with an Apple logo on it. Not saying that google chrome books are bad, but there’s no need to pay a full band for the Air when you could find something similar and a lot cheaper. All in all I really love this laptop."
493,"Bought this laptop with some apprehensions, as i have typically bought refurbished goods from apple directly. This was my first from amazon, and i was not disappointed. The notebook was flawless, not a single scratch on it. second, all the accessories where flawless as well, not signs of usage. When i powered on the notebook to verify usage, the battery had cycled only 3 times, meaning it was still in new condition. Very highly recommended seller. Thanks for a pleasant transaction."
494,"This laptop looked new, straight from Apple store."
495,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   The screen arrived damaged, what a scam.!"
496,"Although I was very skeptical about purchasing a ""refurbished"" MacPro, after reading the reviews for this company, I made the purchase.  The MacPro arrived earlier than expected, expertly wrapped, included Apple certified, and in NEW condition.  There is no way I could tell it was not new or refurbished.  The price was the best I could find after researching other sellers.  I would highly recommend iPower Resale Inc to anyone looking for a MacPro.  Their customer service is exceptional.  Thank you for a great product!  5*****"
497,"When I looked at this product it only had one review and it was a bad one... I then checked all the other products the seller sold and the reviews were excellent, needless to say I took a chance and ordered this MacBook Pro 2019. It arrived before anticipated and it was securely package. I AM SO GLAD I took a chance on them because this MacBook is amazing! Now I’ve waited a couple months before reviewing it to make sure it works. The MacBook looks brand new, it didn’t have any dents or scratches. It works and performs like a new MacBook. I had to contact the seller over the a small issue with the charger and they went above and beyond to correct the issue.Excellent customer service excellent product. I recommend this seller to anyone!"
498,"I got my new MacBook Pro M1 two weeks ago and could not be more happy with it. This machine is absolutely incredible in terms of speed, looks, weight/size, display, and battery life - and texture (it feels so good against the skin on my wrists as I type) and basically anything else you can think of. I also love the space gray color, the new keyboard, the Touch Bar, and the larger trackpad. There are so many options to customize the system to work just the way I like.My previous MacBook was the 2011 model and it still works today, but after 10 years it became too slow and the trackpad had trouble clicking, so after a TON of research, I decided to pull the trigger and get the New MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.A couple suggestions I am able to give after spending almost two months and probably over 30 hours researching the new MacBook are: go with the standard model of 8gb of RAM and the 256 ssd - you can get this on Amazon for $1239 vs $1299 at Apple - so you get to save 60 bucks, and you have the added satisfaction of not having to deal with the snobby nerd losers that work in the Apple Store, who asked me rudely when I went in to get a new laptop ""umm, do you have an appointment? Well, you're going to have to make an appointment if you want to go in the store"". I love Apple products and will never use another phone or computer besides the iPhone and MacBook, but after that experience I will never again give my business to the physical Apple Stores. I mean, seriously, do you really need me to make an appointment to buy a $1300 laptop? Whatever dude.Anyway, in several YouTube videos that compared the 8GB ram model along side the 16GB ram model (costs 200 bucks more), the 8GB performed just as well in nearly every task - and they really pushed it to the limits. The only reason to pay up for the 16GB RAM is if you want to edit 8K UHD videos or are a super serious music recording artist or highly advanced professional photographer - and even then it's not too much of a difference. For the every day user (me or basically anyone who is not a computer professional) the 8GB working with this new M1 chip is mind-blowing, blows any other laptop on the market completely out of the water, and actually even performs just as well as the $2200 15 inch MacBook Pro using the Intel chip. As far as the storage goes, 256 ssd is standard - that's what I got - and you can pay 200 bucks more for 512 ssd or 400 bucks more for 1 TB. But with the Cloud storage available now, you don't really need to keep much on the laptop drive, you can just save it to the cloud.Overall I honestly could go on for hours about every little detail that I absolutely love about this machine. A free one year subscription to Apple TV is also another little perk. But I am still mystified every day at how incredible this machine is. I've been online for over 3 hours now and its still on 92% battery. The new Retina display is brilliant. Everything is perfect. I truly am in love this laptop and would recommend that anyone looking for a new laptop to last a long time and outperform everything else on the market gets the new matchbook 13 inch M1."
499,I bought my Mac from Apple directly not from Amazon. This thing is amazing. Battery life is awesome. Hard to believe that I can work with it all day and do not have to charge at all even with bright screen.No issues with speed at all. I use Matlab a lot and this computer is even slightly faster than my desktop with 12 core AMD CPU and 32 GB ram.Excellent machine. Happy I bought it.
500,"I own over 50 computers and it blows away my 11th gen Dell XPS 13 i7, My surface Book 3, my Ryzen 7 Thinkpad. the first week I got it the battery lasted for 5 days and 22 hrs of use and still had 20% left. I felt guilty and charged it. The Geekbench 5 rating beat all those listed laptops and they had 16 or 32GB of memory and the MacBook Pro M1 had only 8GB of unified memory. The keyboard felt great, the sound was superb, the screen bright, and it was blazing fast in all I did. I'm an IT consultant and deal in Windows based databases and this Mac has now become my daily go to system at home. It has become my new front end."
501,It's a Mac once you go Mac you never go back. This is my second Mac my first lasted almost 9 years.
502,Dead at arrival.... kernel error. Took it to the Apple store they told me looks like a hardware failure and to send it back to Amazon.
503,"I'm going to preface this review with the 1 thing I dislike so we can get that out of the way.I mean let's be honest, that's what most people are looking for when buying a product-the down sides.It has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack EVEN THOUGH apple quit using that on it's handheld products years ago.Not that I care, it's good that they include the 3.5mm jack-but how come they didn't include one for their lightning connector that their headphones come in out of the box? Forces you to either change to a standard headphone jack or BT headphones (probably trying to push their AirPods line).Other than that, I have no issues. It's fast, efficient, reliable and easy to use. If your familiar with iOS on these then it'll be a great addition to the tech team you have at home."
504,"I love my new MacBook Pro!!  It’s the 13” and not too small. It’s very lightweight!  It’s so fast!  I was using an older MacBook Pro from mid 2012. It worked well, just so slow. This one flies!!  I was disappointed that there are no USB ports or CD player. I spent about $65 at Best Buy and got an adapter that works very well!!!"
505,The battery lasts forever and its fast. My last macbook had a pretty good battery and worked very well for years too.The M1 does allow for dual external monitors and there are two usbc ports total. These two things can be worked around with dongles and a video hub but now I have $200 worth of accessories and a tangled mess on my desk.How is a 2020 Mac not compatible with dual monitors but my 2005 HP works great with the same monitor setup?!? I really can't get past that.Get the intel version with 4 USB ports and you can use it in your Covid home office out of the box.
506,"There is no fix for this, and now it can't be returned.  All that money wasted!!! There is a vertical black line on the screen.  I tried to fix it using tips from youtube videos and none of it worked.  Proceed with caution!"
507,"I really wanted to love this laptop. I've had only Macs for years. This was supposed to be an upgrade from my 2014 MacBook Air. I previously had a 2020 16"" intel based MacBook Pro for work configured with two HP monitors. No issues with the monitors and connected instantly with zero effort to get the screens to work with the laptop. Bought this one and connected to my Belkin hub for the HDMIs. Would only connect a single monitor. Googled the issue and found that the new M1 apple chip only supports a single monitor. News to me and I guess I should have researched more. However the low rating stems from the fact that this is a PRO laptop. A professional would want two monitors and should not have to google whether a PRO laptop supports more than 1 monitor when the intel version does seamlessly. Despite this I had planned to keep it and just deal with 1 monitor because of the cost savings over buying the Intel based MacBook Pro and wanted the longer battery life. Now brings me to the issue that made me return the laptop. This laptop just would not configure to show a clear resolution with my monitors. The scale was off and the display just stayed blurry no matter what setting I changed it to on the monitor or the laptop's settings. Tried and tried and just gave up. Returned this and ordered an Intel based 13"" MacBook Pro. No issues, supports dual monitors, and seamlessly integrated to the laptop. No blurry screen and no having to set or change any settings to get it to work. I am floored that Apple would produce a Pro for business that only supports a single monitor. I love Apple but will not buy anything with their chip until the kinks are worked out."
508,This is by far the best laptop ive ever owned! The laptop came with 0 scratches and only 16 battery charges on it. It even came with the apple box and stickers! Highly reccomend for the price. $850 is great for a 2019 macbook air.
509,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Everything I expected and more! Just like brand new!"
510,I love this laptop so so much. I think everyone should get it. The model is between 2018-2020 and the one I got had the Touch ID on it! Everything was very easy to set up and is in such great quality!
511,"Received in a timely manner.  Will review in a couple weeks.Well, it's been over 2 weeks since receiving my MacBook Air and I have to admit that it has proven to be worth it's price. The Retina display is phenomenal and it's compact chassis is just what I was looking for. I am not a power user, so I didn't need major memory capacity. The speakers are, surprisingly, crisp and clear for such a slim build. The fingerprint scanner is quick and a huge convenience. I am (or was) a long-time PC user and resisted getting an Apple, but the transition was smooth and Apple's claim to fame for being user-friendly and intuitive proved true. If you are looking for a compact, yet capable laptop with QWERTY keyboard, I would recommend this product."
512,"After having the laptop a few months, I can say my leap of faith to buy an amazon refurbished was worth it BUT I had to work a little bit.  It didn't arrive perfect and it still isn't perfect.  There is a tiny white dot on the screen where some pixels died (I guess) and when I first got it, I had to call Apple support to get iMessage and Facetime to work on it.  Then I had to take it to the Apple store to get the keyboard fixed as some keys would not work.  Thankfully, I had Apple Care on it so the cost to get it shipped off and fixed wasn't bad.  Overall, I am happy with my purchase and I recommend this seller, but I will probably buy new next time."
513,"** I have only had the laptop for a week, this review is only based off of the time I have had it**I was so nervous to buy a refurbished computer but this came like it was brand new. New packaging, new charger, spotless laptop. I was worried the battery would be bad and wouldn’t hold a charge. I was wrong. I downloaded over 12,000 photos and was on it nonstop for over 2 days without even having to charge it. I am in love with this!!!"
514,"As in the description exactly, thank the seller for the fast shipping and good packaging"
515,I love this laptop and I’m really happy with all the features. Would definitely recommend.
516,Exactly as expected. Great value.
517,"The product made a loud buzzing/grinding airplane-type noise as soon as it finished setting up which was truly deafening. I presume it was the fan producing this aggravating sound. No programs were running and the room was approximately 68 degrees Fahrenheit so overheating should not have been an issue. Since no computer should ever sound like a coffee maker at any time, I must conclude that it was defective. Return to sender."
518,Exceeded my expectations! Some of the reviews had me a bit nervous but I can’t tell you how happy I am! The laptop is on almost brand new condition! Only 1 TINY nick on the front (you can’t see it unless your looking) and it was perfectly ready for me to set up my account! No issues or problems! It comes in a box perfectly protected and has the charger to go with as well👍🏼 So happy with it! Thank you!
519,"I was so excited because this laptop came in perfect condition. But when I tried to change the unsername to my name it wouldn’t work. 3 calls to Apple later, and I find out this computer is owned by a school that can remotely access my laptop at any time. Meaning, if they wanted to they could shut down and erase my laptop. Amazon gave me a full refund but I am very sad and disappointed"
520,"All in all, the laptop works great! It runs fast, it’s clean, and it’s perfect for what I needed it. The one disappointment I have it they claimed this product as a catagory A which means like new. When it arrived, the screen had two scratch marks on it that was discolored from the rest of the screen. I would understand like new for any other part to have a scratch, but the screen is a big deal and it should have mentioned that in the details."
521,"This MacBook Air is amazing!  I had been previously using a 2007 MacBook Air and it was time to upgrade.  I have never purchased refurbished before so I really didn't know what to expect, though was greatly concerned.  Needless to say that this laptop heavily exceeded my expectations.  Other reviewers stated that their MacBook was not as described, though mine looks brand new.  The keys are still crisp and clean, the screen immaculate.  There are a few light scratches on the outside of the computer (mostly the underside), but it is very minimal and unnoticeable.It runs like a dream, though I have only begun using it.  I will update should the computer have any issues.  It is an early 2015 with 4 GB RAM and its OS is Sierra.  I wanted to share that, as I found the Q&A to be a little confusing on that point and other reviews didn't really mention it."
522,"When I received this package, I was thrilled...until I tried to turn it on and got a “low battery” notification...for 16+ hours. Turns out the cord provided (not a Mac product) is not the correct wattage to charge this device. It’s hard to tell at this point if the computer is faulty or not now that I’ve purchased a new cord from Best Buy, but it shuts down as soon as it’s disconnected from power. The screen is pretty floppy, too- falls back without provocation. All of which seem like things that should have been mentioned in the details before I decided to purchase.After taking this computer to the Apple store, I was informed that the issue was indeed the battery- completely bad and had to be replaced. Again, something that I wish I had known before purchasing. It is in working order now, but doesn’t meet my standards of what “certified refurbished” means, and product details lacking for sufficient purchasing knowledge ahead of time."
523,"It said I had to do an update. When I hit the only update allowed it said the latest version was already installed but it wouldn’t let me go foward.  Also the screen seemed loose.  So if it was cleared out they never installed the new software correctly. So it wouldn’t let me even get to the main screen.  Others had luck but I did not.Also when I plugged the power bar in. It had a bit of a shock come out. As an electrician, I know that was a big no no.  I was willing to spend the money and get the correct power cord. But with everything else. I thought that’s already 3 strikes. No thanks."
524,I was very hesitant buying a used MacBook from Amazon but it turned out great! Looks new and works amazingly. You will receive exactly what was described. I have no complaints!
525,"Good quality, arrived early. As-new condition. Easy to install from my old machine via time machine backup. The old one was a 2010, now we are good for another 5-7 years.Thanks"
526,I have been struggling with this product since day one. I am not getting responses from the seller OR the extended warranty repair company.I have never had trouble with Amazon before. Every issue I have ever had has been settled with ease and courtesy.This has not. Made more devastating as it it is the largest purchase I have had and the product has been unusable almost since day one. We sent it to the extended warranty place who said they fixed it but it still doesn’t work.We have spent hours at Apple doing diagnostics and it is simply not functional. To repair it would cost more than I paid. They do not think that the parts it was refurbished with are even Apple parts.This was a terrible product and not worth the money.
527,"I bought this Mac and it came with a non Apple charger, I bought this as travel computer, sure enough in the first week while I was in Europe I had to buy am authentic Apple charger at $117. Now a month  later my Mac has died. It was having issues as in when I tried to maximize the scene with Netflix it would just shrink to a 3x5"" screen volume,  also the screen had been replaced before I bought it and is not well attached, very disappointed, I bought this last summer, but only started to use it in October when I was traveling, so I spent close to $700 for a Mac that lasted 2 months, return and replacement window has ""closed"" so I am stuck with a hefty repair bill."
528,"Was very iffy about buying refurbished but it’s honestly like new! There are a couple of LITTLE scratches but nothing noticeable! Compared to my friends MacBook Air that she paid 1100$ for and they are the absolute same. Best $500 I’ve ever spent. & the company is AWESOME! The charger didn’t work as soon as I got it & I emailed them. Within an hour I had an email from them and they were sending me a new charger, thankful my friend had her charger that I used until I received mine but the battery last like 2-3 days so it wasn’t that bad."
529,"Seller: IT5050Wowie! My son wanted an Apple Computer for Christmas and I was not about to spend $1000+ on a laptop for a 11-year-old boy. But a refurbished MacBook was definitely priced more appropriate for him. This computer is AMAZING people!!! Looks so clean and new. Only a couple faint scratches on the bottom, the keyboard looks like it was hardly touched, screen is clear and no burn marks in it, plus the battery is great. The seller was so awesome to get me this gift in time for Christmas, they are quick to respond to emails and followed up to make sure it was delivered afterward. (seriously, the nicest people!) I had purchased another renewed MacBook from another seller, and their level of quality wasn’t as good, by far. I wish I could pre-select a quality grade for the laptop (excellent, good, fair, etc.), so it is a little scary just leaving it up to the unknown. I work in the retail business and I like to applaud small companies who sell quality products. Do yourself a favor and go here, they gave me a laptop that is stellar and eased my worries about a refurbished laptop. It really looks so good and is operating perfectly. This is such a smarter way to buy a computer, especially for kids, or if you like to have the pricier brands without spending the high price. – Happy Mommy!"
530,"Wow! Bought this from TECHarvard and was claimed to be Certified Refurbished, which according to the Amazon description should show limited to no signs of wear.  Well the device that I received not only was pretty scratched on the bottom, had a huge ding on the corner of the top cover, but the keyboard showed more signs of wear than the MacBook that I've had for 5 years(Space bar was completely warped).  Definitely does not resemble a new device in any way shape or form.  If they are selling used devices, call them used and mark the price down accordingly.  This is definitely going back."
531,"Overall the laptop is nice. A couple of marks on the outside but works relatively well. There was an issue with the battery that originally came with it. It would shut off around 65% battery life. I asked the seller for a replacement battery, which they gave to me free of charge. However, the replacement battery is not originally an Apple battery and instead a knock off. This issue prompted it to restart randomly no matter what the battery life was at. I’m putting the original battery back in and having Apple replace it with the appropriate battery for an additional fee. I got what a paid for and I won’t make the mistake of buying a refurbished Apple product from anywhere other than the Apple store again."
532,This is the BEST purchase I’ve ever made! The laptop 💻 arrived on time and in MINT condition. It functions beautifully and works flawlessly for my personal and business needs. I would recommend this seller to any & all I know who are in the market for reliable and affordable devices.
533,"Battery doesnt work! I travel to another country with the laptop and web I turned on and unplug it, it shuts down! And in Battery Options appears ""Replace now"". How you can help me? I'm in Ecuador now and wont be back in a year!"
534,"I love my new MacBook Air, it came as expected (relatively like new condition). This my first Mac and I’d purchase it again refurbished, you save greatly and get almost the same product 😀"
535,Bought certified refurbished ended up with a unit with a screen covered in dead pixels. I contacted apple to see how much a screen replacement should be more I'm looking a repair cost more than I paid for the laptop.
536,"DO NOT BUY!!! I purchased this computer for about two month and one day I couldn’t turn it on after it goes into sleep mode for a long time. It just wouldn’t turn no matter what I do, I tried every single method out there. I had to press the power button a hundred times for it to finally turn on. But after a while even that won’t work. The computer is just dead. I had to take it to the computer store and they told me it costs $434 to fix it!!!! Even though I actually paid to get it fixed I recommend everyone do not buy!! It’s not worth the money and will cost you more!! The guy in the computer store told me that there is corrosion inside the motherboard and in order to fix it it costs a lot of money ($434). I am truly upset and wished I would have just bought a brand new one from apple that’s the newest version and which will cost me less than what I spent on this computer!!"
537,"The laptop worked great the first week. Eventually, things started to decline and quickly.  I would constantly have to change the time clock, and that would prevent many apps from working properly or not at all. I also discovered that my webcam did not work. I asked customer service if I could get a replacement laptop, and they gave me a website to help me fix it myself. It did not work. Also, the computer would start dying very quickly, even after a full charge. I would also not start up automatically, even with the charger plugged in. I had to press to start button almost endlessly for it to just power on. Eventually, it just would not cut on at all, even with the charger plugged in. It’s completely dead. Apple says that it should cut on with the charger plugged in if it were a battery issue, so it’s definitely something wrong with it beyond that and it will cost upwards of $400 to fix. I’m totally bummed. It did not even last a year."
538,"BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY MOTHER, SHE IS 70 YEARS OLD AND BARELY USES THE LAPTOP.THE SCREEN IS IN THIS STATE, APPEARS TO BE PEELING! VERY BAD!!"

   Note: My purchase was completed through Kanga Supply for this item that ultimately doesn't function as intended.Amazon Renewed item descriptions indicate that the products should work and look like new, which wasn’t the case for this purchase, ergo my poor rating. After only having the Macbook for less than a day, I was forced to reach out to the seller because the product no longer functioned as intended.CONSThe Macbook worked fine for the first hour or so of use, but during an update, the screen flickered vigorously (see video). I hoped it was just a fluke, and it led me to believe there may be some software or hardware-related issue. After having the Macbook for less than 12 hours, I was forced to reach out to the seller because the screen flickering caused the laptop to become unusable (see picture). I also came here to draft a review in hopes that my issue is resolved quickly and effectively. I'll update my review once this is complete.PROSAfter removing the laptop and inspecting the outside, I was pleased. The outside of the Macbook is in good condition, just one or two visible scratches or marks.The charger was not the original Apple charger (as other reviews have indicated) but an OEM adapter. I don’t care that much about whether it’s an Apple charger, as long as it functions.Specs match the advertised item I purchased:128GB SSD8GB ramEDIT/UPDATE: After reaching out to the seller as instructed with the Amazon Renewed products, I never got a response in the allotted timeframe (2 business days) and was forced to reach out to Amazon directly. Ultimately, this item was returned for a refund.UPDATE 2: Today is 1/13/2020 and I have still yet to see this problem resolved to my satisfaction (refund or exchange of working product), after having ordered this product on 12/26/2019. Highly disappointed both in Amazon and the third-party seller.UPDATE 3: Received a replacement Macbook on 1/15/2020. So far it seems to be working, no issues with the screen per the previous item received (was NOT the same item sent back, verified by serial number). Pleased so far with this item."
540,"The 2015 Macbook Pro is still, in my opinion, the best Macbook even in 2019.  I use the SD card reader all the time and have several USB 3.0 devices.  I also use a newer 2017 quad-core i7 for work (no choice) but the difference in speed is not worth the added money and lacking ports.  When I actually put the newer 2017 to work, the heat issue is still a challenge for Apple and performance drops.  It's like having power that I can't actually use unless I sit in a walk-in freezer. Don't quote benchmark speed tests to me, what counts is actual performance sitting at my desk for hours at a time working on a project. I also prefer the magsafe power (although this one uses the magsafe II which I like less than magsafe I which had a more solid connection) This one, I purchased for my wife and it handles everything she needs it to do. Although you can't upgrade the memory on these models, so make sure you get enough for what you need.  If you want to change out memory, then the best choice is the Mid 2012 non-retina model which also come with DVD drives and has USB 3.0 ports."
541,"First off, I am removing a star because they shipped a counterfeit 60W Magsafe 2 charger with my order. I contacted them immediately and they offered to accept a return of everything. I explained that the charger was my only complaint and they overnight FedEx'd a genuine Apple replacement for free.""we sent you the wrong adapter for this batch of order and will overnight you the correct genuine one.""So they knowingly ship counterfeit chargers with some of their orders?The computer is pretty good cosmetically and operationally, but not as great as other reviewers. It is an Early-2015 12,1 model, this one was built in 12/2016. There is a crease over the right USB port from somebody yanking a USB plug. The battery has 107 cycles (89% life left). Keyboard and display are in great shape with no flaws. The SSD has no dead cells. It came with MacOS 10.13 installed.Overall its a good laptop and decent refurbishment job.EDIT: Knocking off another star. They sent me another counterfeit charger. Apple would never loosely jumble the cord in the box, a genuine power supply doesn't stay powered on for several seconds after it's unplugged from the main or stay lit green/orange after its unplugged from the laptop and this fake only puts out 25 watts max."
542,"I really feel like I got a great deal on this, mine arrived in brand new condition and it looked like it had never been used. I did see some people had bad experiences but mine was well worth the price tag. The only negative was that the charger provided is third party and not OEM Apple. The box is also generic and not Apple, not a big deal but you just don't get that same feeling opening it up as a new product. I will say that I checked the serial number on Apple and the computer itself was only a couple of years old, so in reality I paid around $450 for an Apple that was only a couple of years old with a decent amount of battery life still left. I only bought this as there was certain tasks that I could not do on my iPad and so I did not need a brand new super powerful computer. This one is great, does not get hot, fans are silent and the display looks incredible.Overall I was very happy with the purchase, it came fast and was like new condition at the fraction of the cost of a new one. I actually waited a few months before writing this review so that I could also include that I have had no issues at all in that time, battery lasts a decent amount of time and no software or hardware issues to report. It also runs the latest OS that I updated it to and I believe it will be supported software wise for some time to come. Completely worth the price!"

   The Macbook came in working condition with all original components and an OEM charger but not with the extension cord. The major downfall is the condition of the laptop, for the above average asking price for this model I expected great condition as it is stated to be like new but instead the model I received was in okay condition (not cleaned either, large collection of gunk in hinge vent) at best with a lot of edge scratches and deep cuts throughout the chassis, and some unremovable stains from stickers! And worst of all the battery was at over 500 cylces, the battery life was 4-5 hrs max! thats horrible for whats suppose to be a renewed device! Not satisfied!EDIT:  Avoid this entire listing especially from the seller ''Easymobiledevices'', they ship dirty grade b laptop and have poor costumer service."
544,Once i started running it all sort of problems arises. First major problem is wifi drops off and will not let you connect to wifi. After this happens you cant even turn on/off the wifi. Used guest and still no wifi. Restarting or shutdown and restart will not activate wifi. If you restart it takes so long to reboot. Sometimes it get stuck on the waiting wheel on startup. One out of ten restart wifi will work for a minute but then drops off and you will no longer be able to connect again. I cant say anything physically because it looks fine. Lastly beware it shows and says freshly installed mojave os but it has instead sierra installed. The power cord looks like an imitation and not the original one because from the weight it is not the original one. I can tell because i have multiple macbook at home and that is not the original one. I am pretty disappointed with this seller.
545,"I’ll update 15 days from today.CONS:-Delivery packaging: it was a regular box with one thick bubble wrap to protect the laptop.First glance, the charger seems pretty beat up but seems to work fine.-The outer top of the laptop has a lot of scuff marks and scratches. Sides do as well. Nothing TOO severe.-Bottom have some scratches and wearing on the rubber, not too noticeable.PROS:-Had a full battery-Set up went smoothly with no hiccups.-Outer signature glowing Apple works well.-Opening the laptop, the screen has no visible scratches, cracks, or scuffs at all.-Keyboard has no loose keys and is glowing well.-Trackpad has no scratches and works really well no weird working sides SO FAR.-Software automatically updated to Catalina, kinda wanna wait to update to Big Sur.I’ll update March 13, 2021"
546,"Still a GREAT LAPTOP, arguably the best MacBook Pro 13” ever made, 2 or 3 iterations later! I have had mine for 3 months now and although I was a little disappointed that I got a no-brand MagSafe power brick instead of an Apple brand, it’s caused no problems for me. I have been using Logic Pro X a lot and it runs nice and smooth even with the haphazard way I use it, leaving muted unused tracks all over the place as I learn about things like track bouncing and experiment with every single effect and different audio formats (I feel bad sometimes like I am unnecessarily abusing the laptop, lol) and I haven’t frozen or crashed at all. I have used a few emulation programs for old Saturn, Super Famicom, PS and Dreemcast games that push the 2D sprite and parallax scrolling envelope and again I haven’t had any problems. Only thing I have experienced that has been an issue is the actual Mac OS and it’s limitations with regard to formats, programs that it supports and connectivity with outside developers but I have also been able to get around that by setting Virtual Machines up and GUID partitioning to use whatever other OS I need. This is also not a complaint about the hardware itself but rather the Mac OS software so should not be considered when it comes to the actual MacBook Pro 13”.You will want to upgrade to an NVME M2 SSD at least 256 GB or 512 GB right away, as the 128 GB SSD will fill up within 2-3 months of moderate use and the newer M2s will increase the OS loading speed more than anything else. Luckily you have your pick of great SSDs like the Samsung 970 Evo, etc that you can easily swap in with a $5 adapter, a screwdriver and no soldering (just search YouTube for “MB Pro 13 2015 SSD upgrade”)…The unique things and PROS about this MB Pro 13” are the older style KEYBOARD that doesn’t break like 2016-later model keyboards do, 2 USB 3 ports, an SD CARD R/W and a FULL SIZE HDMI PORT all built in. This is the last MB Pro 13 with any of those ports on board and the fact that you can swap SSD hard drives with no soldering and very little skill needed, all-in with the M2 you get a sexy little powerhouse for half the price of the newer model Pro 13”s (1/4 price of current gen)! The rest (CPU, onboard graphics, sound/speakers) make this laptop a must have that will likely only appreciate in value $$$!Two Thunderbolt 2/miniDisplayPorts are useful if you want to setup 2-3 Screens, but the CONS Are that you get NO ThunderBolt 3/USB-C ports and more and more adapters and devices require that connection these days, though with the USB 3 ports there are ways around it, complicated as they may be. You also CANNOT UPGRADE RAM unless you know how to de-solder the current ram and solder up new ram (accepts up to 16GB DDR-3 in 2X8GB formation) and setup the machine to accept the new ram, which seems a recipe to completely destroy the board/laptop without at least some Mac building & Mac hardware programming know-how, possibly even special equipment.MAKE SURE YOU GET THE MODEL WITH THE AMOUNT OF RAM YOU NEED BUILT IN & a CPU that will be sufficient for you and you won’t be disappointed with this awesome little 6 year old laptop! Don’t get the 4 GB model even if it will “work” for you “short-term”! I got the 8GB/i5 2.9Ghz/128GB and I already regret not paying another $100 for the 16GB ram model, but c’est la vie.Just buy this MacBook Pro 13” while you can, replace the SSD as soon as possible, enjoy it, keep it another 5-10 years and you will likely be able to triple your investment by reselling it assuming Apple stays on their current trajectory with their MB Pro Hardware releases!!!"
547,"Hi, I bought this Macbook Pro 13"" early 2015 and received last week on Aug 23th. The laptop has a good appearance and doesn't have any flaws. However, the charger(45w) packed together with the macbook is not for macbook pro but for  Macbook Air. I just found out today, cuz when I use the charger(45w) laptop cpu temperatures goes up to 65-85 celcius. and I can't use more than 4 hours. But when I charge my macbook with Macsafe 1 (85w, which is for Pro), the cpu temperature keeps 40-50 degree, and it runs around 10hours. I want to change my charger into “MacBook Pro Charger 85w”. Thank you."
548,I'm very dissatisfied with this purchase.I can't use the Mac because the hard drive was not reset and the software on the Mac dose not allow you to use it.Also there was no charger.Again very disappointed.
549,"Looks brand new, wrapped and sealed in Apple packaging. Plugged it in and turned it on and let it go. Absolutely no problems, it was automatic and wonderful to have the computer set itself up. Has performed flawlessly as expected of an Apple laptop."
550,"The laptop arrived in fair condition.  The screws show signs of wear so it may have been opened up during the ""renewal"" process.  Old stickers were left on the bottom. Also, the laptop was shipped with a cheap knockoff Chinese charger.  I have no reason to trust this charger so I'll have to order a genuine Apple one instead.Fortunately I don't need this machine to be a workhorse or I would send it back.  This should survive a year at least but I don't trust it as-is - I will wipe the hard disk, NVRAM, and SMC just to be safe."
551,Product was faulty. The charging port wouldn't hold the plug. I returned it. I don't think the refurbishing process is very competent.
552,"This is exactly like the MacBook I was given for work that was stolen on a plane flight. No problems with this as a replacement so far, smooth sailing for 3 months already! I got the protection plan just in case, but I'm very satisfied with this cheaper than new replacement. Will update if there are any issues that arise. Would recommend."
553,"Idk what I was thinking not having an apple in the first place. This laptop is very easy to use, fast, and I’m excited to see how productive I can be with this format. I feel free, nothing holding me back now!! Unlike old pc with unresponsive interface, slow speeds, and constant crashes, this one gives me no problems!!"
554,This laptop was literally like brand new out of the box. So far my daughter is so thrilled with her graduation gift. She is ready for college now!!!
555,"Our first ever Mac but so far its been quite impressive. It was easy to setup and get it going. It works well and very easy to use, turn on/off, carry around and day to day life. Wish the battery would last a bit longer."
556,"BUYER BEWARE!I knew by choosing a refurbished computer, I was taking a risk, but I never expected this. When I received this MacBook Air, I was surprised it was the model Apple stopped making in 2017, since the title said “Newest Version.” I emailed the seller and they said Amazon forced that in the title and told me I could return it. I work full time, am in grad school, and have three kids. I figured with it being an Apple it would last long enough to get me through school, so I kept it. Now, six months later the screen won’t turn on. It’s completely black.I am able to connect to an external monitor and use the computer that way, so I know it’s the display. After trying to adjust the brightness, several resets, resetting the SMC and the PRAM, I called Apple Support. They ruled out all software issues and told me it had to be the hardware.At this point I contacted the seller and they basically told me “sorry, it’s outside of the 90 day window so there’s nothing we will do for you.” I have escalated to Amazon trying to get some kind of resolution. They just confirmed there is nothing they are willing to do for me. They also are not doing anything to penalize the seller, All Out Apple. I'm shocked at Amazon. Shady sellers like All Out Apple will always be around, but I really thought Amazon was better than Ebay in that way. Lesson Learned.There is no reason a MacBook Air should have a display of a completely stops functioning after six months of use, even refurbished. I’m grateful that I had a work-provided monitor I can plug into to do my schoolwork, but if I was aiming to be tethered to my desk, I would have bought a Mac Mini."
557,"Got the computer two days early! this was probably the fastest delivery I've ever received from amazon. I wasn't going to buy refurbished but I really wanted another MacBook and shelling out $2k for a new one was simply out of the question. When I saw the price for this MacBook Air, I decided to roll the dice and buy it. I knew it could possibly come not as advertised, such as having scratches or not being updated as far as software is concerned but when I opened it up it was practically BRAND NEW! set up was simple as can be! only took me 5 minutes to sign in with my Apple ID and all my information was synced between my iPhone and iPad and onto the MacBook Air. There were a few minor scratches less than a couple centimeters on the bottom of the computer nothing that noticeable. the charger doesn't stick as well as I'd like and one of the hinges is half broken off but I've that same issue with practically every MacBook I've ever had. I was really surprised with the quality. it said 2017 version but with all the updates and new iterations its hard to gauge which MacBook your getting I thought I was purchasing a much older MacBook Air than what I got this thing is amazing and the 13 in screen is far larger than I expected it to be feels like a 15 or 17 in display when having it in your hands/ the computer itself is incredibly light, the main reason I chose the air you can carry it in anywhere with one hand and hardly feel it definitely much lighter than my 2020 iPad 11"" All in all if you're on a budget, this computer is the way to go! for $400 its practically brand new and runs like a dream! thanks amazon for this incredible refurbished Mac! love it !"
558,"I don’t what to think I bought 2017 16gb 256 ssd but I received a refurbished 2019 8g 256 perfectly packaged, I can’t put apple care I already call for that but im not sure to keep it because I want a computer of 16of ram but this one is 2019, im gonna give the chance to see how it works, And it cost me the same price of a refurbished 2019 Of apple but those ones you can put apple care"
559,"hola, soy de peru. Estoy contento con la compra, la compre por el precio, y me llego tal cual las especificaciones.(late2018,2.3gz,8ram,256ssd). la bateria llego con 350 ciclos aproxen cuanto a lo estetico, tenia pequeños arañones en un costado, pero nada grave, la pantalla intacta y el touchbar ok. el cargador sellado oem.califico la compra como 9/10."
560,Got a few months out of this before the screen started disappearing intermittently. Then it wasn't so intermittent. I'd have much rather spent the extra money to get a new computer that didn't break than to buy something second-hand and have to decide to repair or replace.
561,"Considering I was 100% ripped off, I would not recommend you purchase from this seller, I did not receive what I wanted, the serial number for a COMPUTER comes up as an iPhone 11... Just.. No."
562,This computer was working fine and all of a sudden the screen went out.  Cost me $640 to fix it.
563,"Delivery was super fast, considering I’m in South Africa. The laptop is simply beautiful, woks well, no complaints, I love it."
564,"Positivo, EXCELENTE EQUIPO!!!"
565,So far this was a steal. Great product for a great value.
566,super machine
567,The space key and some of the keys were not working As they are supposed to. Really sticky
568,"Arrived, boxed well with balloon cushions. Power adapter looked clean but had scratches. Opened up the Lid of the MacBookPro and it looked like it had some sort of disease or cancer & it smelled quite strange too. It had over 50% battery so I carried on with a reset which resulted in an error. Luckily it booted back into Yosemite OS that it had installed years ago, after 3 failed attempts managed to update to Mojave. Of course first things first copy music etc onto, USB stick struggled to go in either of the USB Ports (look at the photos) was also stuck after insertion but managed to pull out, with a hard pull - full force - anger. Had a look into the ports and discovered they were literally rusted dirty like disgusting, this is not the definition of Refurbished - but 2nd Hand or Heavily Used. Be aware, set your expectations right in oder to avoid any disappointments."
569,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I was super stoked upon arrival, began setting up the laptop and within minutes the screen stopped working. Literally pixels. Severely disappointed. I have gotten ahold of kanga and they are working to replace the device but it has now been over a week since I’ve purchased the unit with two day shipping and still have nothing to show for it. I hope they come through on their end and send me a functional unit."
570,"I've only had it for about a week now and this 2015 MacBook Pro is working phenomenally! I was kinda hesitant buying a refurbished MacBook from Amazon, but I can honestly say I'm go glad I went ahead and did. It came extremely fast and right from opening the box, it was as if I had bought a brand new one right from Apple themselves. There's not a scratch, dent, stain, dust or anything on it. So far it's working extremely well and I will definitely buy form this seller in the future and recommend them to others as well! Great price for a great computer."
571,"I’ve had this MacBook Pro going on 4 days and so far so good! It has met all my expectations and more. I grew up using windows PCs. This is my first Apple computer and I’m happy to have made the transition. Wish I did this long time ago but better late then never. If it wasn’t for the packaging and not being in the original box, I probably wouldn’t be able to tell this was refurbished. This is just based from my experience using MacBooks at the Apple store. Also, there was a few minor scratches on the bottom of the laptop.I will revise and change review in a month if any problems. But as of now, my review above is how I feel."
572,"I've only had it for a couple days, but so far this is a great purchase. The thing looks brand new, and I know it isn't. I am replacing an older Mac and just can't afford the prices of new machines from Apple. Using Migration Assistant (an app that comes with Macs) I was able to restore a time machine backup from the old machine, so I've lost nothing in the transition."
573,"When I ordered this product for the first time, it came with a green line on the screen. I contacted the costumer service, they responded very quickly and replaced it.The second computer came with better specs, I was the happiest person... for 2 months though, the computer suddenly stop responding.Other things that are worth saying:- The charger is generic. A generic charger can easily damage the battery of the computer, that could explain my problem.- The second computer they sent, had a sticker that covered the whole low part of the computer (those stickers that are the same color as the computer and are used to cover up very big scratches.Conclusion: they can deliver a great costumer service, but not a working product."
574,"The macbook pro only worked for a short while. It had a charging/powering problem - wouldn't keep a charge at first, then wouldn't power on even when plugged in. Confirmed it was not a charger issue.I contacted the company who said to send it back for repair. Once they received it they wrote saying it cannot be fixed and charged me a ""restocking fee"" in the amount of the purchase of the laptop. Outrageous!! I even had a protection plan for it. After numerous interactions they refused to help and returned the laptop without telling me. THEN they said they couldn't do anything in terms of a refund because I had the machine. Months later they refuse to resolve it and amazon can't help me because it's a third party seller. An ABSOLUTE JOKE of a company. I'm out over $500.00 with a computer that can't be fixed - and Apple store said they could try but for more than the computer's worth. So yeah. They have my money and I have nothing.DO NOT BUY from these people if you'd like to keep your money."
575,"Hey all! So I’ve gotten into photography lately and needed a upgrade from my old 2012 MacBook Pro and 2011 Asus laptops for editing. Figured a 2015 model would be the way to go for a decent upgrade without spending tons of money. I was super skeptical about buying a reconditioned one through Amazon after reading the reviews and thought about it for about 4 hours before I made the transaction. Next day it was at my door step with me a bit nervous about opening the package and seeing a beat up MacBook, I opened the box and the MacBook was in a bubble wrapped sleeve and that’s it. Okay I’m fine with that but what was the condition of it? Looks like it barely got used or the previous owner always had a case on it. Outside from a few nicks here and there it’s flawless. Turns on and is super quick, the Retina display is beautiful and definitely enjoyable to watch movies. It came with Mojave so the first thing I did was update it to Big Sur and it’s still flawless. I’ve only had it for a day if that but so far I’m happy with my purchase. Just be mindful yours may or may not be like mine condition wise I got lucky. Should you buy one of these? I would I’m pleased with my purchase and I’m sure you would be too. But I’ll update with any issues if they come up in the future. Thankfully I’m a bit tech savvy so whatever happens I’m sure I can fix it."
576,"This of course this is an old model and reconditioned/renewed, so I was expecting it to look somewhat used; however, this MacBook Pro is in PERFECT CONDITION as if I had purchased it new. I'm upgrading from a very heavy and slow 2009 white MacBook that's a dinosaur and I could only do very basic things on it. It has almost zero capability in terms of battery life (it could only be used plugged in) so this laptop is an absolute gem in comparison. This might be why I'm so hyped and elated. Plus the price was very good. *I hope the computer doesn't have some sudden glitch and dies on me...lol!Now, I can finally edit my videos in iMovie, which was not working on the old MacBook, because I couldn't update it anymore. I need this laptop mainly for traveling, to do editing work, I have a 2 monitor PC set-up at home. My only wish is that I could transfer my Adobe CS to the new laptop.SIDE NOTE: it's actually overall a little smaller than my old 13"" (screen size is the same), it's not as heavy, but not as light as the Air; it arrived with Catalina iOS installed and I had to upgrade to Monterey to use the newest version of iMovie - this isn't a complaint, just an observation."
577,"I bought for my mom, great deal (sort-of), works great (after I deleted 2 mysterious old unknown wifi connections)I bought this for my mom, she was always having Windows problems, viruses disguised as virus removal, scammy pop-ups, and so on.  Happy day!  :DThey raised prices during Prime Day, wth?  I thought I was getting a good deal, but afterward I noticed the price went down.  Anyway, I ordered this for my mom.  She's been using Windows and I wanted her to experience a Macbook Pro.  This one is actually even better than mine!  I'm still happily using a Late 2013 2.4 Ghz 8 RAM 256 GB 13-inch Retina, her's is exactly the same except it's a Early 2015 and it's actually got 2.7 Ghz!  Anyway she seems really happy with it.  I set it up for her, and ran the serial number, which was not found, not surprisingly although I'm not sure what that means, and the update page in the App Store looks like it was coded in 1995, so I'm not sure what's up with that.  Could be something funky going on, but all I know is it works and we're happy with it.  She's getting used to using it, and she says it's fast and smooth.  She was getting tired of all the Windows updates and virus stuff and all the spammy popups telling her to purchase a virus disguised as virus removal, yadda yadda yadda, so I am well-pleased that she is now almost a full-blown Mac-head.  Thanks Apple.  I hope to be able to afford an Apple car when they do come out, haha.  I'm not sure about the battery-life yet, but I HAD TO replace the battery on mine, so replacing it on hers should not be a problem."
578,It’s just one continuous problem after the other with this computer. It’s really not worth it to save a little bit of money just buy new not refurbished have your warrantee you’re better off in the long run.
579,For this being my first ever Mac- This was an amazing buy... no scratches or dents. Its basically BRAND NEW. 😝😝😝The only thing is that it says 512gb but the space says 256gb so be wary of that.But other than that I am really happy with my purchase.
580,Good
581,Love it
582,"the product arrived with the screen broken. I would like a refund of $ 400 to repair it, since he is now in Brazil."
583,So happy with this purchase. Even my kids said it looks like the new ones. Has some minor imperfections but at the cost totally acceptable. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.
584,"I purchased through amazon this m1 chip 512 gb 8ram macbook pro 2020 year manufacture.  I’m a mac user of many years.  The computer is blazing fast, slim, light with great battery life. A huge bonus—-little need for additional  anti virus add on software since the macbook anti virus platform is very solid. A hidden gem when you buy any apple device is phenomenal tech telephone support.  The advisors at the apple stores and by telephone are the best part of the apple experience for me and even rival the devices they sell. Yes, I hate the high prices and know the game but over time I’ve  accepted their price points because of the incredible tech support."
585,battery would not take any charge  stuck at 1%
586,"I cannot believe the condition my Macbook is in, you can’t even tell if it’s used and the packaging was very nice and professional with the white box and wrapped just like it is when you get it directly from Apple. I am super happy with my purchase, thanks Amazon."
587,"Good, but it is a little small.. easy to control. Recommend if you are hard to control your computer"
588,Computer will not charge.
589,"""Refurbished"" even though Battery life was non existent from the startup, always check the reviews on laptops to make sure they have over 200, cause then you won't be played by greedy ass people like I was"
590,"Minor scratches , for the price reduction is a great buy !!!"
591,Light weight
592,"El producto reacibdiocionado en muy buen estado, funciona perfectamente y venía totalmente protegido y embalado. Muy satisfecho con la compra"
593,"Looks and acts brand new. Everything exactly as advertised. Will update if I have any issues but after a week I can say, I am pleasantly surprised!"
594,"This is an unusually large advance over previous models, especially in raw computing power, but also in fun things like screen and headphone support.This Amazon listing has two different processors, the M1 Pro (listed as 16-Core GPU ""style"") and the M1 Max (32-Core GPU). I'll call one the Pro, the other the Max. I got the base Pro, but much of what I'll say applies to both, and I'll have some comments specifically about the Max too. (MBP below = MacBook Pro.)Amazon doesn't offer most of the options you can get, only the ones listed. For now (and probably later), that's the Pro with 16GB RAM and 512GB or 1TB SSD, or the Max with 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD. 3 versions total.Screen Brightness* and HappinessThis screen can get up to 1600 nits brightness and can sustain full-screen brightness up to 1000. That's very impressive, as MBPs since 2016 have topped out at 500.*But the vast majority of the time, this screen will also top out at 500, because those other numbers are only for HDR (high dynamic range, what Apple calls XDR), i.e. some videos and some photos viewed in some programs. If you're browsing the internet, using productivity apps, or the like, those are almost all SDR (standard dynamic range). You'll be seeing them at the same brightness as with MBPs for the last five years.That said, the new screen is beautiful and bright in both HDR and SDR for most situations. For HDR, it puts out more color and brightness, and darker blacks - a million-to-one contrast ratio - with a wider range of light and color that has more pop and more detail in shadows and highlights. It can be dazzling or just more realistic.For SDR, it's much like before, still a gorgeous screen, with better contrast than before because of darker blacks.Has more pixels per inch (254, up from 226), and more pixels all over (3456 by 2234, up from 3072 by 1920). The aspect ratio remains 16:10 (not counting the top menu bar).ProMotionProMotion is Apple's name for screen refresh rates that can go up to 120Hz, or lower to save processor/battery power when 120 isn't needed. This makes motion smoother, more natural.For now where ProMotion applies is limited. Most scrolling in browsing, including with Safari, still tops out at 60Hz. Which is fine for me, but it bothers some people, looks choppy to them. This could be changed with a software update.Bloom and GhostsBloom is when a bright spot on a dark background bleeds out past where it's supposed to be, a common issue with this kind of screen. I and most others think this screen handles it well (better than the iPad Pro), but it can still arise some.Ghosting is when a moving object leaves a noticeable trail of ghost images behind for a fraction of a second, one for each new frame until the old image fades. MBPs are notoriously mediocre at this kind of ghostbusting, and this screen is no exception. Expect the usual haunting, if you notice that kind of thing.PWMFor those concerned (you mostly know who you are), there is PWM (pulse-width modulation) on the smaller 14"" version of this screen, and so very likely on this one too, at a frequency of 14,880Hz at all brightness levels (measured by NotebookCheck). That's a very high frequency, considered well beyond what would cause trouble for the susceptible.The NotchAs you can see in the main photo here, there's a black Notch at the top of the screen. There are no pixels there. The long-desired improved camera is there, and a mic array and light sensor (and maybe room for a Face ID system if they decide to make MBPs with that). As with the iPhone Notch, it's controversial.You can make the Notch disappear, or rather blend in, if you make the background up there black. It also disappears into the black bars when you view things like videos in full-screen mode.The cursor disappears into the Notch if you put it there. If an app has menu items that stretch there, they disappear too, but they'll still function normally if you put the (invisible) cursor on them.Desperate times call for desperate measures. Most apps won't have this trouble, but if you must, you can avoid menu items disappearing by using the ""Scale to fit"" function, which shrinks the entire screen work area a little to fit below the Notch. Makes it look like an old 15"" if the background is black, like there are wide black bezels. (Google ""Scale to fit below built-in camera"" for full instructions and mockery.)There are also third-party apps, such as Bartender, to manage how items appear in the menu bar and keep them visible.Camera and MicsThe new camera that, along with the thinner bezels, makes the Notch necessary, is 1080p, with an f/2 lens for good exposure in the shadows. Video looks noticeably better than before, though it can have a processed look.The three mics sound very clean and natural but with a little less bass than before to my ears, which is fine.Extra ScreensYou can use two external monitors with the Pro, down from four with previous models. They can be up to 6K @60Hz with a billion colors. The Max can still use four: three 6K and one 4K, all @60Hz etc.You can use 4K @120/144Hz HDR monitors too.You can run two from one port if you use the right kind of dock or daisy-chain.Headphone OomphThe new headphone jack has more power for high-impedance headphones. It automatically adjusts, so it won't overwhelm low-impedance phones. If the headphones have less than 150 ohms impedance, they get 1.25 volts RMS. If more, 3 volts. That might cause it to fail to provide enough power to some not-so-high-impedance headphones that still require extra power, such as planars.With my 2016 15"" MBP, I've had to use a portable amp for my Beyerdynamic DT 1990 Pros (250 ohm), but now I can pretty well do without it, though sometimes only just. The volume on some sources is still not always what I wish I could make it. But now I can nearly achieve hearing loss with the intro to the guitar riff in ""Money for Nothing."" Which also sounds good, and healthier, a couple notches down.Among other headphones that have tested favorably with the new jack are the DT 990 Pros (250 ohm), and the Sennheiser HD650, 660S, 6XX, and HD800 (150 to 300 ohm).One report says the planar Hifiman HE4XXs (35 ohm planar) sound good, but most planars tested are said to need more power. The Audeze LCD-2Cs are reported to sound good enough, though not their best. The LCD-3s and Hifiman Sundaras and Aryas are said to be underpowered.For my usual regular-impedance phones, Cleer Flow IIs (16 ohm), the wired volume is a little louder than before, though still not always the earsplitting barrage I want for some sources. Maybe for the best.Quality iems (in-ear monitors) that require especially clean input, but not too much, reportedly sound good, including Andromedas and Moondrop Starfields.SpeakersThey're improved from the already laptop-leading speakers from earlier MBPs, with a fuller sound and decent kick, amazingly good for when nothing with a 3"" woofer is around.Apple mysteriously says the 14"" M1 has the same speaker system, but looking inside both machines shows the speakers in the 16"" are bigger - both ""subs"" and tweeters - and located differently, with the subs in the front corners on this one. The 16"" has fuller bass (such as it is).Heat and NoiseThere isn't any.None with my typical use, at least. If you push it hard, it can get warm, but not as hot as my 2016 15"". Which makes sense, as this has a larger enclosure, bigger fans, larger, better heat sinks, and more power-efficient processors. The fans don't have to spin up as much to do the same amount of cooling, so it's noticeably quieter even when it does heat up, rarely makes any noise at all.The 16"" Max comes with a larger heat sink than the 16"" Pro, so likely runs a little cooler and quieter sometimes, though the Max might get hotter when it uses a lot of that extra power.KeyboardVery quiet, much like the older Mac laptop keyboards, not the butterfly ones from 2015-19, but the rest. Maybe less travel in the keys than some of those, but plenty for me.I miss the touch bar sliders for fine control of some functions, but you can still use sliders via the Control Center, the icon next to the date on the screen's top menu bar. That's also where control of the keyboard backlight is, no more control for it on the keyboard.TouchpadThe best available by far, responsive and large so you can carry the cursor over a large area with more control. For clicks, it's great. For taps, which I turn off, it's not as great, according to those who prefer that - appears to be a software issue.PortsThere's one less Thunderbolt/USB-C port than before, but 50% more bandwidth (3 controllers instead of 2).The HDMI is 2.0, can drive up to 4K HDR @60Hz.The SD card reader is shallow, so the cards stick out. There might be room for a flush micro-SD adapter. I only have cards up to 64GB, which work fine. Some people have had trouble reading some cards, so it may be finicky.Battery LifeI usually keep plugged in, but the reviews I've seen that cover battery life tests typically say it's the longest of any similar machine they've tested, including PCs. Reports of battery life for office work, browsing, watching videos, and so on generally range from 10 to 16 hours, sometimes more. It can go unusually long with heavy use too, 5 hours or more of video work, for example. Max Tech did 10 benchmark and stress tests with it in a couple hours, some maxing out the CPU or GPU for up to ten minutes, and it still had 36% left.At normal settings, there's no performance hit until you get down to 3%; until then you can process or game at full tilt. There's a low-power mode that extends battery life by limiting performance, lowering screen brightness, etc. The Max also has a high-power mode, but it seems to only ramp up the fans sooner to help cooling. Apple's description and tests in reviews indicate it doesn't affect performance in any direct way.The Max has tended to have a little less battery life than the Pro in reviews. The only good tests I've seen that compared directly either found negligible differences or up to 15% less battery life for the Max. (Other tests haven't been well controlled.)You can quick charge to 50% in a half-hour. The new power brick is 45% more powerful than before, and maybe 30% larger lengthwise, still small for what it does. You can charge at lower speed with smaller bricks (not included) via the USB-C ports.Size and WeightIt's noticeably heavier than before, about 5 ounces over the previous 16"", and not quite as sleek, but it's sleeker than I was expecting from the photos.RepairabilityHa ha! But really, it's better than it was. Battery modules now have pull tabs so they can be more easily replaced. The screen can be replaced more easily, but if Apple doesn't do it you lose True Tone (which I don't want anyway). The headphone, Thunderbolt and MagSafe ports can be replaced without replacing the logic board. Now rates a 4/10 from iFixit for repairability, up from 1/10 for the previous model.CompatibilityComes with Rosetta 2, which enables M1 Macs to use programs written for Intel Macs, and usually works very well.There's no more Boot Camp, so to run Windows or Windows programs you have to use third-party software like Parallels, which runs Windows by emulating a Windows machine (and requires a Windows license), or Crossover, which modifies Windows programs to run on Macs.  Which works best, or at all, depends on the program.GamingWoW *mostly* runs 50 to 120fps at high settings and resolution, depending on the location. Some places can't even manage 50 at those settings, though, but do OK at more compromised settings. Baldur's Gate 3, Diablo III, CS:GO and several others can run at 60-100fps or better at good settings.You can play Windows games via Parallels or Crossover. They generally don't run as well, but some do fine.Most games, including native ones, run quite a bit better on the Max, with up to 2x the fps. Final Fantasy XIV is hit and miss at good settings even with the Max.Gaming isn't usually hot or noisy, can get warmer with light fans for the games that aren't running natively. And there's no noticeable performance hit for gaming on battery.WorkI have to mention the less fun part: how well this does things you might have to do at work. It does almost all of it better than before, much of it way better. Here's how it compares according to actual test results from numerous sources with Xcode, Logic Pro, Lightroom, Blender, Final Cut Pro, Premiere Pro, and so on. The range of comparison depends on what the task is.Previous base MBP 16"" (Intel i7 AMD 5300): The Pro is 60% to several times faster.Previous top-spec'd MBP (i9 5600M): The Pro is about the same to 2 or 3 times faster.Regular M1 machines (not M1 Pro or Max): The Pro is about the same to several times faster.The 14"" M1 Pro with same specs: The same, though the 16"" has the bigger battery and heat removal system, so it fares better in those ways.Windows laptop work stations: This is complicated, but the Pro can thrash most Windows laptops in most intensive work-related apps. It lines up very roughly with machines with a good i7/i9 and an RTX 3070, but generally can't keep up with the RTX 3080. The Pro uses a fraction of the power, and so only produces a fraction of the heat and noise, if any. And lasts and performs much better on battery.Pro vs MaxThe Max is about the same to twice as fast as the Pro, mostly between those extremes. The CPU is much the same, but the GPU is double the cores, so the main advantage is in graphics-heavy work.Besides the GPU cores, the Max has twice the bandwidth for memory transfer, two hardware video encode engines instead of one, and some extra cooling capacity.If you're already successfully using a Mac laptop, you don't *need* the Max, since the Pro is already better than what you have. But that doesn't mean you can't benefit from the Max's extra power if you have the money. For intensive video editing, massive photo editing, or better gaming (though cheaper Windows machines will play most games better), the Max has real advantages.To confuse things a little more, Apple (but not Amazon currently) also offers a demi-Max with a 24-core GPU, halfway between the Pro's 16 and the Max's 32. It's a cheaper way to get the extra bandwidth, video encoder, and cooling advantages of the Max. Tests show that in graphics-intensive tasks it operates roughly midway between the Pro and 32-core Max, often more than half, as expected.WarrantiesThis comes with a one-year limited warranty against manufacturing defects that includes free phone support for the first 90 days. If you want to also cover accidental damage (with deductibles) and extend the regular warranty and free tech support to 3 years, you can buy 

AppleCare+ from Amazon

   (link embedded) or Apple. You get 60 days from purchase to buy it, but coverage for accidents doesn't start until you do. (I always self-insure when I can, so I didn't get it.)DecalsLast and least, this comes with two black Apple decals, the sign of true professional Apple equipment."
595,Out of the box unusable for me. This MacBook Pro does not have any USB ports to be able to restore from a previous Mac back up that’s on an external drive. You must buy an adapter. Since I live in a remote area I’d have to order online and wait. You cannot even plug a iPhone12 Pro Max directly into it. The only ports it has are thunderbolt. So even Apple’s own lighting connector needs an adapter. The keyboard is a downgrade from the old keyboard. Solid black plastic instead of plastic keys surrounded by aluminum which were easier to see. Had to call Apple support to download an update because there is no reset option in the System Preferences of OS Monterey. And the update did not work to give it that option. Will have to figure out a different option to remove my account and information to return it. This particular MacBook is defective I believe.
596,I ordered the 2021 16 inch right away as I knew they would probably sell out fast. I had to make sure I had one for my trip I am leaving on soon.  As soon as I opened it the screen would never come on.  Thought maybe it needed charging so I tried that.  Still nothing but a black screen.  It kept making the sound when you open it up even when it was closed over and over again.  I took it to the local Apple Store hoping I could get some answers.  They tired to get it to work and could not either.  They said it is very strange and maybe something happened to it during shipping.  They said since it is brand new it would be best to get my money back from Amazon.  I thought maybe I could just exchange it before my trip but the one I ordered is out of stock.  I will try the 14 inch and see if I like it compared to the size of the 16 inch since it is in stock.  This is a first MacBook Pro I have ever purchased and now I am a bit nervous.
597,"Here are the temperature results for the new cool MacBooks compared to the old overheating intel ones. 91 degrees for the old one near the processor, and 74 degrees on the new ones. Both had been running for hours transferring files nonstop. Amazing. I have been editing video, transferring large files and not once have the fans kicked on. Makes me want to cry."
598,"Finally, this 2021 MacBook Pro cured my depression!"
599,Arrived DOA - wouldn’t start up. Spent hours on the phone with Apple support and still wouldn’t start. Returned - c’mon man!
600,"This laptop is unbelievably fast. Between the screen, battery life, and performance, this laptop is head and shoulders better than any competition."
601,My first ever MacBook. Switched over from PC and I can't believe I didn't switch sooner! On the pricer side but I'm super happy with my purchase!
602,"I have been using my MacBook Pro from 2014 for work until last week when I finally purchased this MacBook Pro. My old MacBook starts up and works as fast as the day I bought it. The only reason I bought a new MacBook was because the battery life was getting low. I probably could have just bought a new battery and it would have been fine.That being said, I did hold out for this MacBook because Apple brought back the ports that I needed. I use the HDMI and SD ports daily. An Ethernet port would have been nice but that’s asking too much. This MacBook has a 2 day battery life and is blazing fast. I use Adobe programs and this MacBook doesn’t even blink when I do live editing. Best laptop I have ever used.I own a business that uses many PC laptops and a couple MacBooks. A PC will never last as long as a MacBook. And, a PC ALWAYS gets slower after 6 months of use. The price is high but you can buy a new PC every 2 years or a MacBook every 7 years."
603,"Coming from a 2019 16in, I feel that this generation is 2 steps forwards, 1 step back.Pros:-Fans are never audible even under full extended load!  This was my #1 issue with my 2019 mac which would have constant fan noise with 2 monitors.-2x battery life-Better screen especially in dark environment or a dark subject-Extremely fast for certain workloads such as video editing and code compilation.-magsafe is back (although I personally don't care for it)-most apps work normally with rosetta emulation, but may have some stutter.Cons:-thicker and SIGNIFICANTLY heavier.-Screen has a notch which is very distracting for me.-Still has some compatibility issues.-Terrible for games.  Only a few titles are supported natively.  I only tested league of legends(uses rosetta emulator), but it was choppy and 1/3 the fps of my 2019 intel macbook.- +$300 base price even though they got rid of intel.-The area I feel apple has made a major misstep is with ports.  I couldn't care less for SD card or HDMI, but everyone who buys this is going to need USB-A.  It's ridiculous that I still have to bring a dongle everywhere just to use my mouse but these ports I never/rarely use are back.Also some developer related tools/libraries aren't working.C# debugger is totally unsupported for example.  Anything that requires gpu hardware acceleration (pytorch) is unlikely to ever be supported in any usable form.  Linux dual boot is unsupported or in early experimental stages.  I also had issues building/running java projects natively, but no issues with rosetta.If you're looking to buy this for an undergrad program, it's probably workable.  However, I'd suggest saving some $ and getting a used mac or windows machine.  Professional devs will be aware of their specific requirements, but I suspect many will need to keep a secondary x86 machine for the foreseeable future."
604,"I am writing this review focused primarily on people who are considering jumping from the 13"" MacBook Pro to the 14"" MacBook Pro, which is what I did. I moved from the 13"" MacBook Pro M1 with 16gb of RAM to the 14"" MacBook Pro M1 Pro with 16gb of RAM.Size: So, 1"" of screen might not seem like a lot on its face, but the difference is pretty substantial, in my opinion. Even the pictures don't quite do it justice. The screen feels considerably larger in a package that isn't considerably larger. For me, it's the perfect sweet spot for someone who wants something larger than the 13"" model, but smaller than the 16"". I had a 16"" MacBook Pro i9 and it was just too much for me. This one feels perfect.Form Factor: The new 14"" and 16"" MacBooks both adopt a thicker chassis, which is shown in the pictures. As such, Apple decided to make the casing flat instead of gently rounded. It honestly reminds me of the pre-unibody builds, but still sleek and modern. If I didn't know this one was new and you just laid them side-by-side, I might say that the old form factor looks a little newer, but that isn't to say that it looks bad.Aesthetics: Overall, I touched on the aesthetics a bit in the ""form factor"" section. It looks like a high-end laptop, but at the same time I can see some people thinking it looks dated. I personally like the flatter look over the more rounded look, but it will depend on the person. Another thing I like is moving the ""MacBook Pro"" branding from under the screen to the bottom of the casing. I just think it provides a cleaner look during use. The black background of the keyboard is also a plus for me. The old space gray background was fine, but I really like the black.Function: Most people probably won't notice a massive difference in the previous iteration and the new iteration. For the 14"" and 16"" MacBook Pros, the touchbar has been removed. This will make a lot of people happy. For me, I was always pretty ambivalent about the touchbar, but I'm not going to complain about a key row there. The keyboard appears to have ever so slightly more travel and bounce. It's not a huge amount, but it is noticeable. I'll touch on The Notch later.Performance: My 13"" had the M1 chip and now my 14"" as the M1 Pro. So far, I haven't noticed a tremendous difference when using programs like Logic Pro, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Lightroom, but I wouldn't say those are super intensive programs. If you're exporting massive 8K videos, you might want to jump up to the M1 Max. One thing I have noticed is that the thermals are maybe a little bit worse. Just a touch. I have noticed it warming up a bit, but the fan still has not come on once. I only mention this because my 13"" M1 stayed cold at all times. It's not as bad as my i9, which sounded like a jet engine revving up while it jumped well over 100 degrees, but it's something to be aware of.The Notch: Honestly, so much has been made of the notch and I think it's mostly overstated. Yes, it's fun to meme the fact that Apple still hasn't found a way around the notch, particularly on iPhones, but it's really not a huge deal. Were it up to me, I would have just left a bezel up there, but I can understand why Apple didn't. I use a Dell XPS for work and it has razor thin bezels with no notch, but at the same time the camera is an absolute joke. Looks like it's from 2002.The Notch (cont'd): The notch behavior can be inconsistent from app to app, but not to the point where it's bothersome. I have seen some programs with very large nav menus up top bump the status bar out of the way to make room. And while this particular phenomenon is not something new for MacBooks, losing a big chunk of that bar to the notch will likely make this a more regular occurrence for people. Do I wish it didn't have a notch? Yeah, probably. Does it hurt the experience? Very, very little.Screen: For everyday indoor use, which is almost exclusively what I do, I think you will be hard-pressed to find a better screen on the market. The 120Hz refresh rate is something I waited a long time to get on the iPhone, so I was pretty shocked to see it implemented on the new MacBook Pros just a month later. It actually has more pixels/inch than the iMac 27"" 5K screen, which I also use pretty regularly. All-in-all, the screen is just the best in the business.Overall: It's a great and powerful laptop for someone who is wanting a little more than web surfing and word processing. I use mine primarily for recording music, as well as live performances using standalone plugins, so I need something that is powerful and easy to use. The MacBook Pro has always fit the bill, but now with the M1, M1 Pro, and M1 Max chips, I have absolutely no concern for performance or consistency.My 13"" M1 did just what I needed in this regard, but I'm someone who wanted a slightly larger screen without drastically increasing my footprint and weight. The 14"" MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip is just what I needed. If you're someone who needs absolutely top notch performance, I'd recommend upgrading the RAM and going with the M1 Max."
605,"I haven't upgraded my computer for more than a decade, so it would stand to reason any recent releases would impress me, but this macbook pro has gone above and beyond in the small time I've had it.The screen is truly something to behold. Smooth, clear, just beautiful. I don't typically care about bezels, but I might start. The expanded screen makes an unexpected difference. Meanwhile, I barely notice the notch. Apple said they'd find workarounds to make it scarce, and they have.The speakers are wonderful as well. I was skeptical at first -- thought I caught some tinny effects on a couple songs, but the more I listen to them, the more I'm convinced the tinniness was in the recording (it was a live album, which might explain it). As for the spatial audio, I've only heard a couple songs, but it's pretty trippy. This is my first experience with it, and it doesn't disappoint.In the short time I've had the computer, it's been nothing but fast. Probably more computer than I need, so if you're a sound editor or photographer, this review probably isn't for you. But for those of you casual users who want a solid machine that will last (as I said, my last macbook pro made it more than a decade), this is the one. Excited as I was for my last macbook, I could see room for improvement at the time. Right now, I don't see how things get better than this."
606,"M1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. Compared to previous MacBook Pro, it's a giant leap ahead. These tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the Macbook. This particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro,  but it still kicks butt. You can get the Pro Max chip and bump up the RAM to 64GB if you want - and add tons more storage. The 14 inch MacBook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. It can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. The display is stunning. Just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. The brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. Real HDR viewing -  a big difference. You will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. After 10 minutes I don't even notice it. It means nothing for your experience. Its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. Camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous MacBooks. Six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. Music/movies it feels like surround sound. For video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. The keyboard is a dream to type on. Very solid like all MacBooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. The Apple Magic Keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. Battery life is amazing. I have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. At best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! Especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it won't be 17 hours but I did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. The power efficiency is ground breaking. They have added back the MagSafe power plug - which is great! And added back an SD card slot and and an HDMI port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. I wish it had at least one USB-A old style port - but it doesn't. You get three USB-C thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. They got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro MacBooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. Apparently they listened to a lot of users who didn't really like the touch pad. The shape and style of this laptop is great. Some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. That is BS. I have been typing most of the day and I don't feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. Very comfy for typing. Some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new Macbook Pro, but I am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside -  this is an amazing laptop - the best Apple has ever made, hands down. And I would say you won't find a better power laptop anywhere.  All that said - this is not a gamers machine. Apple is not for hard core gamers. I mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. I am a hard core gamer and a PC geek  - I have a powerful windows PC for gaming. And always will. But for everything else. this MacBook is king. I use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. I can plut into a giant monitor if I want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch IPS panel. So if you are wondering if this Macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - I am here to tell you, its the real deal. I finally upgraded from my 2015 MacBook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. If you are thinking of getting one - you won't be disappointed. One last comment. I am an old timer windows guy, and I know all the counter arguments for the Mac. Many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. First, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new M1 Pro chips - you can't. And aside from that, the Mac OS is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text FROM A PHOTO! Whaaat? And the design/ergonomics/quality of these MacBooks is unmatched. So, yes you pay more - but you get more. My last MacBook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. If you want this laptop - get it! It rocks."
607,"I have a Mabook Pro covered by Apple care. The computer needs a new battery. To make a long story short Apple left me for months with a computer, again under warranty, which I can use for a couple of hours for simple tasks like web browsing before it needs to be recharged. Apple refused to replace the battery because the diagnostic read 81% not below 80 % as per policy. In all this Apple didn’t have any problems asking me to invest countless hours of my time between doing clean installs trips to apple stores etc.. I feel a more respectful way to treat me as a loyal customer could have been let us replace the battery first and if that doesn’t fix the issue which I seriously doubt ask me to do troubleshooting. All this to save something that would probably cost you few $$. Seriously ?"
608,sent me base model
609,"I probably got a faulty laptop but the charger status doesn’t show it’s charging when plugged in, only thing indicating that it’s charging is the orange light. My chrome windows keeps crashing whenever I put the computer to sleep and the external video display rarely connects"
610,"I never write reviews, but feel compelled to write one for this Macbook Pro. I've owned macs consistently since 1990s and have dealt with eye strain on the air and now on this laptop. It gave me horrible headaches and eye strain even with a matte protector. I returned it and am now looking at PCs for the first time because if I can't read from the screen without it making me sick, I can't use it."
611,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   My first MacBook ever! I had been saving up for it before the official drop— & I was not disappointed! Love the Touch ID feature, and it’s so efficient! Can’t wait to use it when I go back to school!"
612,"This laptop has a superior display, superior speakers, superior camera and an excellent keyboard. Don't go cheap and buy the ""affordable"" MacBook Air base model like some of these talking heads have been advising. It's not a good buy if you are unhappy with it after six months, and believe me, you will be unhappy with 8 GB of RAM and two USB ports after six months. M1 MacBooks are not upgradeable so if you find that you need more RAM, you are stuck. Unless all you are doing sending emails, tweets, and watching TicTok, you will probably need something more, especially if you are using your laptop for work. I'm using my MacBook Pro with an LG UltraFine 5K 27 inch display as my desktop system, which replaces a 27 inch iMac. I'm very happy."

   Sheeeese! What can I say? Apple has done it again 🤪😍 magnificent piece of device I must say."
614,"I pulled the trigger on this thing hoping that the bad reviews were wrong.. some of the comments saying it came dirty and defective definitely gave me pause however, what arrived today was practically a brand new macbook. the device does not show any signs of wear and the battery cycle count is 18, it came with the original power brick and while the cable was used, it was not worn or dirty in any way. While i've only just started using the device about an hour ago, I can tell you that it's speedy and works flawlessly... had I not known it was a refurb when buying it, I would have easily confused it for a brand new mbp.. for those asking, this is a 2017 macbook pro and the specs as quoted are accurate. i'll play around with this thing for a little while and update this review as needed, but so far this looks like a winner!***update***A few months in and it’s still working flawlessly. I don’t regret my purchase for one second, and neither should you!"
615,This is not a 256GB MacBook Pro- they are falsely advertising it as such and then shipping buyers 128GB versions.
616,"Came in used and dirty, and it was not even turn off, I'm gonna return it. So disappointed."
617,"Wow. I cant say enough how happy I am with this laptop! I it arrived early, and for a refurbished computer I swear it doesn't have a scratch, dent, smudge or single flaw anywhere on it! Its fast, the battery is great, its working perfectly! I couldn't be happier with this thing!"
618,"Was excited to receive it and on the outside it had one noticable chip in the case on the cover side (which had a sharp edge to it), but thought that isn't too bad.  But when opening it up the screen in both the top left and top right were broken/chipped/cracked like it had been dropped and they replaced the cover, but not the screen.  This was not acceptable.  Wanted to try it out and ended up learning that some of the keys did not work right (sticky, pushed strange and such), plus the touchpad/mouse was really strange and didn't seem to work correctly.  Too many issues out of the box for me and too concerned that there might be other issues from where it looked to have been dropped and such.  Sending it back and just started that process.  So far the return seems ok....but just hate that the product does not match the description...using their words ""Renewed products work and look like new""."
619,"I ordered the space gray with 256 gb of ram and received a silver with 128gb.  I knew this could happen as the picture did not match the description and I had seen other similar reviews.The good news is it was on time and in flawless condition.  I think I will stick with it and not press my luck, as it is still a fair price and a great machine, but beware."
620,"I have to admit, I don't typically write reviews and I was a little hesistant about the product due to some 1 to two star reviews. The space gray model not only is at a great price, it came to me brand new. With all the specs I was expecting, i5 8GB RAM 256GB SSD, and works like a dream. Battery life is great, setting up was easy, and all my Apple Products (iPhone, Apple watch, Earpods) synced with no issues. I'm not sure as to why there were so many negative reviews, but mine is not one of them. SO HAPPY!! I truly recommend."
621,the battery is dead
622,"This product arrived quickly and looked great.  There have been multiple glitches with the power switch and with the screen ever since it's arrival.  Most of the time the power button would require multiple attempts to push before the computer would power up.  When the computer woke from sleep state (opening lid after its been closed for at least fifteen minutes) the screen would be black and then all pixelated.  Most recently, the computer wouldn't even turn on, when it finally did, it was all reset and all the settings were reset.  I lost everything I had put on the computer over the past day.  The seller still hasn't gotten back to me after email and I left a voice message.  I have now initiated a return as I want my money back.  It would have been nice if they had gotten back to me ASAP when I emailed or when I called (during normal hours of operation, by the way) and it went to voicemail.  The fact that they didn't and the computer kept coming up with other issues.  I now will buy a new one.  The value is not there with the aggravation generated."
623,"Multiple reviews mentioned getting devices with used batteries, screen issues, etc.My laptop arrived through FedEx Express with questionable packaging. But everything was intact and fine. The laptop still had the plastic wrapped around it as MacBooks directly from Apple do, even with the screen cover. Only 3 battery cycles out of the box, with a new charger in the box. I am very satisfied with the purchase although in the Q&A section of this product someone mentions that this is a 2018 model, its not, its a 2017 (At least the one I received.) which for me isn't really a big deal since it arrived in exceptional condition. Highly recommend this MacBook."
624,I'm a fan of apple products and I like almost everything about this new MBA. But it has one huge flaw that nobody talks about. It's the camera hardware and it hasn't been updated in ages. My zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light. A $1000 laptop with 10 year old front camera is unacceptable. Camera is very important to me. Especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time.
625,"Liked:- Long battery life (one charge WILL last all day, i.e. 16 hours. Personally tested true)- Speed (the new M1 processor really is fast)- Quiet (no fan but the laptop still does not get hot)- Light and portable- High resolution & bright displayDisliked:- As with other MacBooks, the keyboard is mediocre especially compared to laptops like Lenovo Thinkpad- Incompatible applications (With the M1 processor still being new, you might experience existing programs frequently crash. For example, Chrome keeps crashing) But I would guess there will be a fix soon"
626,"UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable.The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long.Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using ""swap memory"" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board.***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB.I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models.There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD.***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly.------I purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12"" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1.The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco.I likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive ""Pro Apps"" running at the same time.I would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.I would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball ""not responding"" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1. If however, you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable, faster and cooler running than the Intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable Mac."
627,"The M1 chip really is amazing. But it only lasted five days for me. Somehow mine managed to break after using a third party USB C hub. The screen wouldn’t turn on at all, and an Apple repair tech couldn’t figure it out after doing a few quick tests. Oh and then Apple said it would take a month to replace it with a new one."
628,"Beautiful laptop. I’ve upgraded from the MacBook Air of old...so far this laptop has blown it away. It wasn’t overly pricey to be honest and I feel it’s worth the price. Overall look is great and keyboard feel is nice. Larger touchpad is great, I’ve paired my Magic Trackpad 2 with it as well."
629,"I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13"" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13"" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.Good:- SCREEN looks great!  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  I usually don't go above 50% brightness.- KEYBOARD is good.  Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard.  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic.  Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great.  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.- LOOKS GREAT.  Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.- NO FAN.  That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.- PERFORMANCE.  It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time.  For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU.  Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27"" (top end) with Intel chips.- TOUCH ID is great still.  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons.  On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA.  Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch).  You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay.  And so on and so forth.- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.NOT GOOD:- WEBCAM still sucks.  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc.  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27"" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera).- ONLY 2 PORTS.  Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort).  Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame.  I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.OVERALL:A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem.  Love it so far!"
630,No complains so far.  Very fast and performs great.  I had a 2014 MacBook Air and finally upgraded this year.  This is leagues beyond that entry and I’m very happy with this upgrade.
631,"Lightweight, blazing fast, easy to use, battery life is incredible with the new Apple M1 chip.  A typical Great Apple product.However, there is only a Thunderbolt port, so you now have to go out and buy a cable to convert USB to thunderbolt (if you want to use a backup hard drive) or other USB items, AND, I had to buy yet another cable to sync my phone's lightning port to the thunderbolt port on the computer. Total $56.I LOVE Apple product, and worked for them in my caerer, but I would wait on buying this version until the software for it has been developed.UPDATE: After several months of using this computer, I have have found several things of concern:1.  my notification center keeps disappearing, despite my constant reinstalling the widgets.2.  my computer's calendar, reminders, and photo stream do not sync with my IOS devices (iPhone & iPad).  If I add an item to calendar on my phone, it will appear on my mac but not vice versa.  Reminders will not sync regardless of which device I originate the item on.I have contacted Apple support on all these issues and they cannot solve the problem.IT APPEARS THAT THE BUGS HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED OUT, YET.  THINGS ARE MADDENINGLY CLUNKY!"

   Bought this laptop bc i needed it for spring semester and i needed an upgrade from my heavy macbook pro. I go to work too so i needed something super light and thin i can just bring everywhere and slide it in my bag.I am obsessed with how fast this macbook is. The battery life is on point. I used it for movies and series at work and it lasted for 3 days. The processor is definitely sooo good. I open so many tabs at once and it has not lagged on me. The keyboard and trackpad is responsive.I love the color. The main reason why i bought this too. 😍😂I have no problems with it at all.Highly recommend"
633,Opened my brand new $1000++ computer and the entire screen was cracked and destroyed. Awesome! Thanks Amazon.
634,"Delivered to me within 12 hours of purchase... Sealed in original apple packaging with protective film, blemish free, not a scratch.. Mint.its powerful, Ive already loaded some big task audio software and broadcast software on it and its flying through the multiple processes together at ease... (Logic 10.5 / Traktor DJ 3.0 / OBS)Super light and portable, If this is a MacBook Pro then I can't even imagine how light the Air models are. Nor could I even imagine why you may need something more powerful. I am having to adjust to the new keyboard and Touch Bar, I keep hitting Siri and volume settings, even as I type this.id also recommend getting a keyboard cover as well.... I hear these keyboards go out sometimes and to repair it. This is no fault to the reseller, but I can't believe Apple with their price points don't offer a bigger SSD for the lowest price point.... 128gb is laughable so be prepared to buy an external SSD along with a Thunderbolt 3 / USB-C Hub to run hdmi, and various external accessories.Overall I love this computer so far, it was a nail biter as I rarely ever shell out $1,000 on anything but I'm very pleased and satisfied with my purchase. And I still cannot find a better deal on the internet, not even used on Facebook marketplace, letgo or craigslist....Five stars"
635,So not worth it. All they want to do is take your money do NOT BUY THIS ONE! Its used and if you search apple on amazon they have brand new with higher stats for cheaper.
636,"Just received this, but so far so good. It looks BRAND NEW. There are literally NO signs of cosmetic wear or damage. It arrived in a sealed apple box. I’m finishing setting up and I already love it. For just under $1,200 for a 2019 model, this is a GREAT deal!"
637,"I really love my MacBook. I really love this laptop. I'm a huge MacBook fan and this works like new. So far I don't have a problem with the butterfly keyboard, but I heard bad reviews about the keyboard from watching YouTube videos. I think that they may have fixed the keyboard problem when they refurbished the product??? I'm not sure, but honestly this a really great laptop for a really great price. I do wish that it came in the original Apple box and packaging, but it wasn't far from the really deal."
638,"It looks and feels brand spanking new! Definitely happy with my purchase considering that I bought a brand new 2020 MacBook Air and hated it. Returned it back in 2 days. I paid a lot less for the Pro than the Air and its A LOT better with so many features. I’m not trying to persuade anyone out of getting the Air but if you are considering on buying a MacBook my advice would be to just go ahead and get the pro. The Air reminds me of a google chrome book slapped with an Apple logo on it. Not saying that google chrome books are bad, but there’s no need to pay a full band for the Air when you could find something similar and a lot cheaper. All in all I really love this laptop."
639,"Bought this laptop with some apprehensions, as i have typically bought refurbished goods from apple directly. This was my first from amazon, and i was not disappointed. The notebook was flawless, not a single scratch on it. second, all the accessories where flawless as well, not signs of usage. When i powered on the notebook to verify usage, the battery had cycled only 3 times, meaning it was still in new condition. Very highly recommended seller. Thanks for a pleasant transaction."
640,"This laptop looked new, straight from Apple store."
641,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   The screen arrived damaged, what a scam.!"
642,"Although I was very skeptical about purchasing a ""refurbished"" MacPro, after reading the reviews for this company, I made the purchase.  The MacPro arrived earlier than expected, expertly wrapped, included Apple certified, and in NEW condition.  There is no way I could tell it was not new or refurbished.  The price was the best I could find after researching other sellers.  I would highly recommend iPower Resale Inc to anyone looking for a MacPro.  Their customer service is exceptional.  Thank you for a great product!  5*****"
643,"When I looked at this product it only had one review and it was a bad one... I then checked all the other products the seller sold and the reviews were excellent, needless to say I took a chance and ordered this MacBook Pro 2019. It arrived before anticipated and it was securely package. I AM SO GLAD I took a chance on them because this MacBook is amazing! Now I’ve waited a couple months before reviewing it to make sure it works. The MacBook looks brand new, it didn’t have any dents or scratches. It works and performs like a new MacBook. I had to contact the seller over the a small issue with the charger and they went above and beyond to correct the issue.Excellent customer service excellent product. I recommend this seller to anyone!"
644,"I got my new MacBook Pro M1 two weeks ago and could not be more happy with it. This machine is absolutely incredible in terms of speed, looks, weight/size, display, and battery life - and texture (it feels so good against the skin on my wrists as I type) and basically anything else you can think of. I also love the space gray color, the new keyboard, the Touch Bar, and the larger trackpad. There are so many options to customize the system to work just the way I like.My previous MacBook was the 2011 model and it still works today, but after 10 years it became too slow and the trackpad had trouble clicking, so after a TON of research, I decided to pull the trigger and get the New MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.A couple suggestions I am able to give after spending almost two months and probably over 30 hours researching the new MacBook are: go with the standard model of 8gb of RAM and the 256 ssd - you can get this on Amazon for $1239 vs $1299 at Apple - so you get to save 60 bucks, and you have the added satisfaction of not having to deal with the snobby nerd losers that work in the Apple Store, who asked me rudely when I went in to get a new laptop ""umm, do you have an appointment? Well, you're going to have to make an appointment if you want to go in the store"". I love Apple products and will never use another phone or computer besides the iPhone and MacBook, but after that experience I will never again give my business to the physical Apple Stores. I mean, seriously, do you really need me to make an appointment to buy a $1300 laptop? Whatever dude.Anyway, in several YouTube videos that compared the 8GB ram model along side the 16GB ram model (costs 200 bucks more), the 8GB performed just as well in nearly every task - and they really pushed it to the limits. The only reason to pay up for the 16GB RAM is if you want to edit 8K UHD videos or are a super serious music recording artist or highly advanced professional photographer - and even then it's not too much of a difference. For the every day user (me or basically anyone who is not a computer professional) the 8GB working with this new M1 chip is mind-blowing, blows any other laptop on the market completely out of the water, and actually even performs just as well as the $2200 15 inch MacBook Pro using the Intel chip. As far as the storage goes, 256 ssd is standard - that's what I got - and you can pay 200 bucks more for 512 ssd or 400 bucks more for 1 TB. But with the Cloud storage available now, you don't really need to keep much on the laptop drive, you can just save it to the cloud.Overall I honestly could go on for hours about every little detail that I absolutely love about this machine. A free one year subscription to Apple TV is also another little perk. But I am still mystified every day at how incredible this machine is. I've been online for over 3 hours now and its still on 92% battery. The new Retina display is brilliant. Everything is perfect. I truly am in love this laptop and would recommend that anyone looking for a new laptop to last a long time and outperform everything else on the market gets the new matchbook 13 inch M1."
645,I bought my Mac from Apple directly not from Amazon. This thing is amazing. Battery life is awesome. Hard to believe that I can work with it all day and do not have to charge at all even with bright screen.No issues with speed at all. I use Matlab a lot and this computer is even slightly faster than my desktop with 12 core AMD CPU and 32 GB ram.Excellent machine. Happy I bought it.
646,"I own over 50 computers and it blows away my 11th gen Dell XPS 13 i7, My surface Book 3, my Ryzen 7 Thinkpad. the first week I got it the battery lasted for 5 days and 22 hrs of use and still had 20% left. I felt guilty and charged it. The Geekbench 5 rating beat all those listed laptops and they had 16 or 32GB of memory and the MacBook Pro M1 had only 8GB of unified memory. The keyboard felt great, the sound was superb, the screen bright, and it was blazing fast in all I did. I'm an IT consultant and deal in Windows based databases and this Mac has now become my daily go to system at home. It has become my new front end."
647,It's a Mac once you go Mac you never go back. This is my second Mac my first lasted almost 9 years.
648,Dead at arrival.... kernel error. Took it to the Apple store they told me looks like a hardware failure and to send it back to Amazon.
649,"I'm going to preface this review with the 1 thing I dislike so we can get that out of the way.I mean let's be honest, that's what most people are looking for when buying a product-the down sides.It has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack EVEN THOUGH apple quit using that on it's handheld products years ago.Not that I care, it's good that they include the 3.5mm jack-but how come they didn't include one for their lightning connector that their headphones come in out of the box? Forces you to either change to a standard headphone jack or BT headphones (probably trying to push their AirPods line).Other than that, I have no issues. It's fast, efficient, reliable and easy to use. If your familiar with iOS on these then it'll be a great addition to the tech team you have at home."
650,"I love my new MacBook Pro!!  It’s the 13” and not too small. It’s very lightweight!  It’s so fast!  I was using an older MacBook Pro from mid 2012. It worked well, just so slow. This one flies!!  I was disappointed that there are no USB ports or CD player. I spent about $65 at Best Buy and got an adapter that works very well!!!"
651,The battery lasts forever and its fast. My last macbook had a pretty good battery and worked very well for years too.The M1 does allow for dual external monitors and there are two usbc ports total. These two things can be worked around with dongles and a video hub but now I have $200 worth of accessories and a tangled mess on my desk.How is a 2020 Mac not compatible with dual monitors but my 2005 HP works great with the same monitor setup?!? I really can't get past that.Get the intel version with 4 USB ports and you can use it in your Covid home office out of the box.
652,"There is no fix for this, and now it can't be returned.  All that money wasted!!! There is a vertical black line on the screen.  I tried to fix it using tips from youtube videos and none of it worked.  Proceed with caution!"
653,"I really wanted to love this laptop. I've had only Macs for years. This was supposed to be an upgrade from my 2014 MacBook Air. I previously had a 2020 16"" intel based MacBook Pro for work configured with two HP monitors. No issues with the monitors and connected instantly with zero effort to get the screens to work with the laptop. Bought this one and connected to my Belkin hub for the HDMIs. Would only connect a single monitor. Googled the issue and found that the new M1 apple chip only supports a single monitor. News to me and I guess I should have researched more. However the low rating stems from the fact that this is a PRO laptop. A professional would want two monitors and should not have to google whether a PRO laptop supports more than 1 monitor when the intel version does seamlessly. Despite this I had planned to keep it and just deal with 1 monitor because of the cost savings over buying the Intel based MacBook Pro and wanted the longer battery life. Now brings me to the issue that made me return the laptop. This laptop just would not configure to show a clear resolution with my monitors. The scale was off and the display just stayed blurry no matter what setting I changed it to on the monitor or the laptop's settings. Tried and tried and just gave up. Returned this and ordered an Intel based 13"" MacBook Pro. No issues, supports dual monitors, and seamlessly integrated to the laptop. No blurry screen and no having to set or change any settings to get it to work. I am floored that Apple would produce a Pro for business that only supports a single monitor. I love Apple but will not buy anything with their chip until the kinks are worked out."
654,This is by far the best laptop ive ever owned! The laptop came with 0 scratches and only 16 battery charges on it. It even came with the apple box and stickers! Highly reccomend for the price. $850 is great for a 2019 macbook air.
655,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Everything I expected and more! Just like brand new!"
656,I love this laptop so so much. I think everyone should get it. The model is between 2018-2020 and the one I got had the Touch ID on it! Everything was very easy to set up and is in such great quality!
657,"Received in a timely manner.  Will review in a couple weeks.Well, it's been over 2 weeks since receiving my MacBook Air and I have to admit that it has proven to be worth it's price. The Retina display is phenomenal and it's compact chassis is just what I was looking for. I am not a power user, so I didn't need major memory capacity. The speakers are, surprisingly, crisp and clear for such a slim build. The fingerprint scanner is quick and a huge convenience. I am (or was) a long-time PC user and resisted getting an Apple, but the transition was smooth and Apple's claim to fame for being user-friendly and intuitive proved true. If you are looking for a compact, yet capable laptop with QWERTY keyboard, I would recommend this product."
658,"After having the laptop a few months, I can say my leap of faith to buy an amazon refurbished was worth it BUT I had to work a little bit.  It didn't arrive perfect and it still isn't perfect.  There is a tiny white dot on the screen where some pixels died (I guess) and when I first got it, I had to call Apple support to get iMessage and Facetime to work on it.  Then I had to take it to the Apple store to get the keyboard fixed as some keys would not work.  Thankfully, I had Apple Care on it so the cost to get it shipped off and fixed wasn't bad.  Overall, I am happy with my purchase and I recommend this seller, but I will probably buy new next time."
659,"** I have only had the laptop for a week, this review is only based off of the time I have had it**I was so nervous to buy a refurbished computer but this came like it was brand new. New packaging, new charger, spotless laptop. I was worried the battery would be bad and wouldn’t hold a charge. I was wrong. I downloaded over 12,000 photos and was on it nonstop for over 2 days without even having to charge it. I am in love with this!!!"
660,"As in the description exactly, thank the seller for the fast shipping and good packaging"
661,I love this laptop and I’m really happy with all the features. Would definitely recommend.
662,Exactly as expected. Great value.
663,"The product made a loud buzzing/grinding airplane-type noise as soon as it finished setting up which was truly deafening. I presume it was the fan producing this aggravating sound. No programs were running and the room was approximately 68 degrees Fahrenheit so overheating should not have been an issue. Since no computer should ever sound like a coffee maker at any time, I must conclude that it was defective. Return to sender."
664,Exceeded my expectations! Some of the reviews had me a bit nervous but I can’t tell you how happy I am! The laptop is on almost brand new condition! Only 1 TINY nick on the front (you can’t see it unless your looking) and it was perfectly ready for me to set up my account! No issues or problems! It comes in a box perfectly protected and has the charger to go with as well👍🏼 So happy with it! Thank you!
665,"I was so excited because this laptop came in perfect condition. But when I tried to change the unsername to my name it wouldn’t work. 3 calls to Apple later, and I find out this computer is owned by a school that can remotely access my laptop at any time. Meaning, if they wanted to they could shut down and erase my laptop. Amazon gave me a full refund but I am very sad and disappointed"
666,"All in all, the laptop works great! It runs fast, it’s clean, and it’s perfect for what I needed it. The one disappointment I have it they claimed this product as a catagory A which means like new. When it arrived, the screen had two scratch marks on it that was discolored from the rest of the screen. I would understand like new for any other part to have a scratch, but the screen is a big deal and it should have mentioned that in the details."
667,"This MacBook Air is amazing!  I had been previously using a 2007 MacBook Air and it was time to upgrade.  I have never purchased refurbished before so I really didn't know what to expect, though was greatly concerned.  Needless to say that this laptop heavily exceeded my expectations.  Other reviewers stated that their MacBook was not as described, though mine looks brand new.  The keys are still crisp and clean, the screen immaculate.  There are a few light scratches on the outside of the computer (mostly the underside), but it is very minimal and unnoticeable.It runs like a dream, though I have only begun using it.  I will update should the computer have any issues.  It is an early 2015 with 4 GB RAM and its OS is Sierra.  I wanted to share that, as I found the Q&A to be a little confusing on that point and other reviews didn't really mention it."
668,"When I received this package, I was thrilled...until I tried to turn it on and got a “low battery” notification...for 16+ hours. Turns out the cord provided (not a Mac product) is not the correct wattage to charge this device. It’s hard to tell at this point if the computer is faulty or not now that I’ve purchased a new cord from Best Buy, but it shuts down as soon as it’s disconnected from power. The screen is pretty floppy, too- falls back without provocation. All of which seem like things that should have been mentioned in the details before I decided to purchase.After taking this computer to the Apple store, I was informed that the issue was indeed the battery- completely bad and had to be replaced. Again, something that I wish I had known before purchasing. It is in working order now, but doesn’t meet my standards of what “certified refurbished” means, and product details lacking for sufficient purchasing knowledge ahead of time."
669,"It said I had to do an update. When I hit the only update allowed it said the latest version was already installed but it wouldn’t let me go foward.  Also the screen seemed loose.  So if it was cleared out they never installed the new software correctly. So it wouldn’t let me even get to the main screen.  Others had luck but I did not.Also when I plugged the power bar in. It had a bit of a shock come out. As an electrician, I know that was a big no no.  I was willing to spend the money and get the correct power cord. But with everything else. I thought that’s already 3 strikes. No thanks."
670,I was very hesitant buying a used MacBook from Amazon but it turned out great! Looks new and works amazingly. You will receive exactly what was described. I have no complaints!
671,"Good quality, arrived early. As-new condition. Easy to install from my old machine via time machine backup. The old one was a 2010, now we are good for another 5-7 years.Thanks"
672,I have been struggling with this product since day one. I am not getting responses from the seller OR the extended warranty repair company.I have never had trouble with Amazon before. Every issue I have ever had has been settled with ease and courtesy.This has not. Made more devastating as it it is the largest purchase I have had and the product has been unusable almost since day one. We sent it to the extended warranty place who said they fixed it but it still doesn’t work.We have spent hours at Apple doing diagnostics and it is simply not functional. To repair it would cost more than I paid. They do not think that the parts it was refurbished with are even Apple parts.This was a terrible product and not worth the money.
673,"I bought this Mac and it came with a non Apple charger, I bought this as travel computer, sure enough in the first week while I was in Europe I had to buy am authentic Apple charger at $117. Now a month  later my Mac has died. It was having issues as in when I tried to maximize the scene with Netflix it would just shrink to a 3x5"" screen volume,  also the screen had been replaced before I bought it and is not well attached, very disappointed, I bought this last summer, but only started to use it in October when I was traveling, so I spent close to $700 for a Mac that lasted 2 months, return and replacement window has ""closed"" so I am stuck with a hefty repair bill."
674,"Was very iffy about buying refurbished but it’s honestly like new! There are a couple of LITTLE scratches but nothing noticeable! Compared to my friends MacBook Air that she paid 1100$ for and they are the absolute same. Best $500 I’ve ever spent. & the company is AWESOME! The charger didn’t work as soon as I got it & I emailed them. Within an hour I had an email from them and they were sending me a new charger, thankful my friend had her charger that I used until I received mine but the battery last like 2-3 days so it wasn’t that bad."
675,"Seller: IT5050Wowie! My son wanted an Apple Computer for Christmas and I was not about to spend $1000+ on a laptop for a 11-year-old boy. But a refurbished MacBook was definitely priced more appropriate for him. This computer is AMAZING people!!! Looks so clean and new. Only a couple faint scratches on the bottom, the keyboard looks like it was hardly touched, screen is clear and no burn marks in it, plus the battery is great. The seller was so awesome to get me this gift in time for Christmas, they are quick to respond to emails and followed up to make sure it was delivered afterward. (seriously, the nicest people!) I had purchased another renewed MacBook from another seller, and their level of quality wasn’t as good, by far. I wish I could pre-select a quality grade for the laptop (excellent, good, fair, etc.), so it is a little scary just leaving it up to the unknown. I work in the retail business and I like to applaud small companies who sell quality products. Do yourself a favor and go here, they gave me a laptop that is stellar and eased my worries about a refurbished laptop. It really looks so good and is operating perfectly. This is such a smarter way to buy a computer, especially for kids, or if you like to have the pricier brands without spending the high price. – Happy Mommy!"
676,"Wow! Bought this from TECHarvard and was claimed to be Certified Refurbished, which according to the Amazon description should show limited to no signs of wear.  Well the device that I received not only was pretty scratched on the bottom, had a huge ding on the corner of the top cover, but the keyboard showed more signs of wear than the MacBook that I've had for 5 years(Space bar was completely warped).  Definitely does not resemble a new device in any way shape or form.  If they are selling used devices, call them used and mark the price down accordingly.  This is definitely going back."
677,"Overall the laptop is nice. A couple of marks on the outside but works relatively well. There was an issue with the battery that originally came with it. It would shut off around 65% battery life. I asked the seller for a replacement battery, which they gave to me free of charge. However, the replacement battery is not originally an Apple battery and instead a knock off. This issue prompted it to restart randomly no matter what the battery life was at. I’m putting the original battery back in and having Apple replace it with the appropriate battery for an additional fee. I got what a paid for and I won’t make the mistake of buying a refurbished Apple product from anywhere other than the Apple store again."
678,This is the BEST purchase I’ve ever made! The laptop 💻 arrived on time and in MINT condition. It functions beautifully and works flawlessly for my personal and business needs. I would recommend this seller to any & all I know who are in the market for reliable and affordable devices.
679,"Battery doesnt work! I travel to another country with the laptop and web I turned on and unplug it, it shuts down! And in Battery Options appears ""Replace now"". How you can help me? I'm in Ecuador now and wont be back in a year!"
680,"I love my new MacBook Air, it came as expected (relatively like new condition). This my first Mac and I’d purchase it again refurbished, you save greatly and get almost the same product 😀"
681,Bought certified refurbished ended up with a unit with a screen covered in dead pixels. I contacted apple to see how much a screen replacement should be more I'm looking a repair cost more than I paid for the laptop.
682,"DO NOT BUY!!! I purchased this computer for about two month and one day I couldn’t turn it on after it goes into sleep mode for a long time. It just wouldn’t turn no matter what I do, I tried every single method out there. I had to press the power button a hundred times for it to finally turn on. But after a while even that won’t work. The computer is just dead. I had to take it to the computer store and they told me it costs $434 to fix it!!!! Even though I actually paid to get it fixed I recommend everyone do not buy!! It’s not worth the money and will cost you more!! The guy in the computer store told me that there is corrosion inside the motherboard and in order to fix it it costs a lot of money ($434). I am truly upset and wished I would have just bought a brand new one from apple that’s the newest version and which will cost me less than what I spent on this computer!!"
683,"The laptop worked great the first week. Eventually, things started to decline and quickly.  I would constantly have to change the time clock, and that would prevent many apps from working properly or not at all. I also discovered that my webcam did not work. I asked customer service if I could get a replacement laptop, and they gave me a website to help me fix it myself. It did not work. Also, the computer would start dying very quickly, even after a full charge. I would also not start up automatically, even with the charger plugged in. I had to press to start button almost endlessly for it to just power on. Eventually, it just would not cut on at all, even with the charger plugged in. It’s completely dead. Apple says that it should cut on with the charger plugged in if it were a battery issue, so it’s definitely something wrong with it beyond that and it will cost upwards of $400 to fix. I’m totally bummed. It did not even last a year."
684,"BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY MOTHER, SHE IS 70 YEARS OLD AND BARELY USES THE LAPTOP.THE SCREEN IS IN THIS STATE, APPEARS TO BE PEELING! VERY BAD!!"

   Note: My purchase was completed through Kanga Supply for this item that ultimately doesn't function as intended.Amazon Renewed item descriptions indicate that the products should work and look like new, which wasn’t the case for this purchase, ergo my poor rating. After only having the Macbook for less than a day, I was forced to reach out to the seller because the product no longer functioned as intended.CONSThe Macbook worked fine for the first hour or so of use, but during an update, the screen flickered vigorously (see video). I hoped it was just a fluke, and it led me to believe there may be some software or hardware-related issue. After having the Macbook for less than 12 hours, I was forced to reach out to the seller because the screen flickering caused the laptop to become unusable (see picture). I also came here to draft a review in hopes that my issue is resolved quickly and effectively. I'll update my review once this is complete.PROSAfter removing the laptop and inspecting the outside, I was pleased. The outside of the Macbook is in good condition, just one or two visible scratches or marks.The charger was not the original Apple charger (as other reviews have indicated) but an OEM adapter. I don’t care that much about whether it’s an Apple charger, as long as it functions.Specs match the advertised item I purchased:128GB SSD8GB ramEDIT/UPDATE: After reaching out to the seller as instructed with the Amazon Renewed products, I never got a response in the allotted timeframe (2 business days) and was forced to reach out to Amazon directly. Ultimately, this item was returned for a refund.UPDATE 2: Today is 1/13/2020 and I have still yet to see this problem resolved to my satisfaction (refund or exchange of working product), after having ordered this product on 12/26/2019. Highly disappointed both in Amazon and the third-party seller.UPDATE 3: Received a replacement Macbook on 1/15/2020. So far it seems to be working, no issues with the screen per the previous item received (was NOT the same item sent back, verified by serial number). Pleased so far with this item."
686,"The 2015 Macbook Pro is still, in my opinion, the best Macbook even in 2019.  I use the SD card reader all the time and have several USB 3.0 devices.  I also use a newer 2017 quad-core i7 for work (no choice) but the difference in speed is not worth the added money and lacking ports.  When I actually put the newer 2017 to work, the heat issue is still a challenge for Apple and performance drops.  It's like having power that I can't actually use unless I sit in a walk-in freezer. Don't quote benchmark speed tests to me, what counts is actual performance sitting at my desk for hours at a time working on a project. I also prefer the magsafe power (although this one uses the magsafe II which I like less than magsafe I which had a more solid connection) This one, I purchased for my wife and it handles everything she needs it to do. Although you can't upgrade the memory on these models, so make sure you get enough for what you need.  If you want to change out memory, then the best choice is the Mid 2012 non-retina model which also come with DVD drives and has USB 3.0 ports."
687,"First off, I am removing a star because they shipped a counterfeit 60W Magsafe 2 charger with my order. I contacted them immediately and they offered to accept a return of everything. I explained that the charger was my only complaint and they overnight FedEx'd a genuine Apple replacement for free.""we sent you the wrong adapter for this batch of order and will overnight you the correct genuine one.""So they knowingly ship counterfeit chargers with some of their orders?The computer is pretty good cosmetically and operationally, but not as great as other reviewers. It is an Early-2015 12,1 model, this one was built in 12/2016. There is a crease over the right USB port from somebody yanking a USB plug. The battery has 107 cycles (89% life left). Keyboard and display are in great shape with no flaws. The SSD has no dead cells. It came with MacOS 10.13 installed.Overall its a good laptop and decent refurbishment job.EDIT: Knocking off another star. They sent me another counterfeit charger. Apple would never loosely jumble the cord in the box, a genuine power supply doesn't stay powered on for several seconds after it's unplugged from the main or stay lit green/orange after its unplugged from the laptop and this fake only puts out 25 watts max."
688,"I really feel like I got a great deal on this, mine arrived in brand new condition and it looked like it had never been used. I did see some people had bad experiences but mine was well worth the price tag. The only negative was that the charger provided is third party and not OEM Apple. The box is also generic and not Apple, not a big deal but you just don't get that same feeling opening it up as a new product. I will say that I checked the serial number on Apple and the computer itself was only a couple of years old, so in reality I paid around $450 for an Apple that was only a couple of years old with a decent amount of battery life still left. I only bought this as there was certain tasks that I could not do on my iPad and so I did not need a brand new super powerful computer. This one is great, does not get hot, fans are silent and the display looks incredible.Overall I was very happy with the purchase, it came fast and was like new condition at the fraction of the cost of a new one. I actually waited a few months before writing this review so that I could also include that I have had no issues at all in that time, battery lasts a decent amount of time and no software or hardware issues to report. It also runs the latest OS that I updated it to and I believe it will be supported software wise for some time to come. Completely worth the price!"

   The Macbook came in working condition with all original components and an OEM charger but not with the extension cord. The major downfall is the condition of the laptop, for the above average asking price for this model I expected great condition as it is stated to be like new but instead the model I received was in okay condition (not cleaned either, large collection of gunk in hinge vent) at best with a lot of edge scratches and deep cuts throughout the chassis, and some unremovable stains from stickers! And worst of all the battery was at over 500 cylces, the battery life was 4-5 hrs max! thats horrible for whats suppose to be a renewed device! Not satisfied!EDIT:  Avoid this entire listing especially from the seller ''Easymobiledevices'', they ship dirty grade b laptop and have poor costumer service."
690,Once i started running it all sort of problems arises. First major problem is wifi drops off and will not let you connect to wifi. After this happens you cant even turn on/off the wifi. Used guest and still no wifi. Restarting or shutdown and restart will not activate wifi. If you restart it takes so long to reboot. Sometimes it get stuck on the waiting wheel on startup. One out of ten restart wifi will work for a minute but then drops off and you will no longer be able to connect again. I cant say anything physically because it looks fine. Lastly beware it shows and says freshly installed mojave os but it has instead sierra installed. The power cord looks like an imitation and not the original one because from the weight it is not the original one. I can tell because i have multiple macbook at home and that is not the original one. I am pretty disappointed with this seller.
691,"I’ll update 15 days from today.CONS:-Delivery packaging: it was a regular box with one thick bubble wrap to protect the laptop.First glance, the charger seems pretty beat up but seems to work fine.-The outer top of the laptop has a lot of scuff marks and scratches. Sides do as well. Nothing TOO severe.-Bottom have some scratches and wearing on the rubber, not too noticeable.PROS:-Had a full battery-Set up went smoothly with no hiccups.-Outer signature glowing Apple works well.-Opening the laptop, the screen has no visible scratches, cracks, or scuffs at all.-Keyboard has no loose keys and is glowing well.-Trackpad has no scratches and works really well no weird working sides SO FAR.-Software automatically updated to Catalina, kinda wanna wait to update to Big Sur.I’ll update March 13, 2021"
692,"Still a GREAT LAPTOP, arguably the best MacBook Pro 13” ever made, 2 or 3 iterations later! I have had mine for 3 months now and although I was a little disappointed that I got a no-brand MagSafe power brick instead of an Apple brand, it’s caused no problems for me. I have been using Logic Pro X a lot and it runs nice and smooth even with the haphazard way I use it, leaving muted unused tracks all over the place as I learn about things like track bouncing and experiment with every single effect and different audio formats (I feel bad sometimes like I am unnecessarily abusing the laptop, lol) and I haven’t frozen or crashed at all. I have used a few emulation programs for old Saturn, Super Famicom, PS and Dreemcast games that push the 2D sprite and parallax scrolling envelope and again I haven’t had any problems. Only thing I have experienced that has been an issue is the actual Mac OS and it’s limitations with regard to formats, programs that it supports and connectivity with outside developers but I have also been able to get around that by setting Virtual Machines up and GUID partitioning to use whatever other OS I need. This is also not a complaint about the hardware itself but rather the Mac OS software so should not be considered when it comes to the actual MacBook Pro 13”.You will want to upgrade to an NVME M2 SSD at least 256 GB or 512 GB right away, as the 128 GB SSD will fill up within 2-3 months of moderate use and the newer M2s will increase the OS loading speed more than anything else. Luckily you have your pick of great SSDs like the Samsung 970 Evo, etc that you can easily swap in with a $5 adapter, a screwdriver and no soldering (just search YouTube for “MB Pro 13 2015 SSD upgrade”)…The unique things and PROS about this MB Pro 13” are the older style KEYBOARD that doesn’t break like 2016-later model keyboards do, 2 USB 3 ports, an SD CARD R/W and a FULL SIZE HDMI PORT all built in. This is the last MB Pro 13 with any of those ports on board and the fact that you can swap SSD hard drives with no soldering and very little skill needed, all-in with the M2 you get a sexy little powerhouse for half the price of the newer model Pro 13”s (1/4 price of current gen)! The rest (CPU, onboard graphics, sound/speakers) make this laptop a must have that will likely only appreciate in value $$$!Two Thunderbolt 2/miniDisplayPorts are useful if you want to setup 2-3 Screens, but the CONS Are that you get NO ThunderBolt 3/USB-C ports and more and more adapters and devices require that connection these days, though with the USB 3 ports there are ways around it, complicated as they may be. You also CANNOT UPGRADE RAM unless you know how to de-solder the current ram and solder up new ram (accepts up to 16GB DDR-3 in 2X8GB formation) and setup the machine to accept the new ram, which seems a recipe to completely destroy the board/laptop without at least some Mac building & Mac hardware programming know-how, possibly even special equipment.MAKE SURE YOU GET THE MODEL WITH THE AMOUNT OF RAM YOU NEED BUILT IN & a CPU that will be sufficient for you and you won’t be disappointed with this awesome little 6 year old laptop! Don’t get the 4 GB model even if it will “work” for you “short-term”! I got the 8GB/i5 2.9Ghz/128GB and I already regret not paying another $100 for the 16GB ram model, but c’est la vie.Just buy this MacBook Pro 13” while you can, replace the SSD as soon as possible, enjoy it, keep it another 5-10 years and you will likely be able to triple your investment by reselling it assuming Apple stays on their current trajectory with their MB Pro Hardware releases!!!"
693,"Hi, I bought this Macbook Pro 13"" early 2015 and received last week on Aug 23th. The laptop has a good appearance and doesn't have any flaws. However, the charger(45w) packed together with the macbook is not for macbook pro but for  Macbook Air. I just found out today, cuz when I use the charger(45w) laptop cpu temperatures goes up to 65-85 celcius. and I can't use more than 4 hours. But when I charge my macbook with Macsafe 1 (85w, which is for Pro), the cpu temperature keeps 40-50 degree, and it runs around 10hours. I want to change my charger into “MacBook Pro Charger 85w”. Thank you."
694,I'm very dissatisfied with this purchase.I can't use the Mac because the hard drive was not reset and the software on the Mac dose not allow you to use it.Also there was no charger.Again very disappointed.
695,"Looks brand new, wrapped and sealed in Apple packaging. Plugged it in and turned it on and let it go. Absolutely no problems, it was automatic and wonderful to have the computer set itself up. Has performed flawlessly as expected of an Apple laptop."
696,"The laptop arrived in fair condition.  The screws show signs of wear so it may have been opened up during the ""renewal"" process.  Old stickers were left on the bottom. Also, the laptop was shipped with a cheap knockoff Chinese charger.  I have no reason to trust this charger so I'll have to order a genuine Apple one instead.Fortunately I don't need this machine to be a workhorse or I would send it back.  This should survive a year at least but I don't trust it as-is - I will wipe the hard disk, NVRAM, and SMC just to be safe."
697,Product was faulty. The charging port wouldn't hold the plug. I returned it. I don't think the refurbishing process is very competent.
698,"This is exactly like the MacBook I was given for work that was stolen on a plane flight. No problems with this as a replacement so far, smooth sailing for 3 months already! I got the protection plan just in case, but I'm very satisfied with this cheaper than new replacement. Will update if there are any issues that arise. Would recommend."
699,"Idk what I was thinking not having an apple in the first place. This laptop is very easy to use, fast, and I’m excited to see how productive I can be with this format. I feel free, nothing holding me back now!! Unlike old pc with unresponsive interface, slow speeds, and constant crashes, this one gives me no problems!!"
700,This laptop was literally like brand new out of the box. So far my daughter is so thrilled with her graduation gift. She is ready for college now!!!
701,"Our first ever Mac but so far its been quite impressive. It was easy to setup and get it going. It works well and very easy to use, turn on/off, carry around and day to day life. Wish the battery would last a bit longer."
702,"BUYER BEWARE!I knew by choosing a refurbished computer, I was taking a risk, but I never expected this. When I received this MacBook Air, I was surprised it was the model Apple stopped making in 2017, since the title said “Newest Version.” I emailed the seller and they said Amazon forced that in the title and told me I could return it. I work full time, am in grad school, and have three kids. I figured with it being an Apple it would last long enough to get me through school, so I kept it. Now, six months later the screen won’t turn on. It’s completely black.I am able to connect to an external monitor and use the computer that way, so I know it’s the display. After trying to adjust the brightness, several resets, resetting the SMC and the PRAM, I called Apple Support. They ruled out all software issues and told me it had to be the hardware.At this point I contacted the seller and they basically told me “sorry, it’s outside of the 90 day window so there’s nothing we will do for you.” I have escalated to Amazon trying to get some kind of resolution. They just confirmed there is nothing they are willing to do for me. They also are not doing anything to penalize the seller, All Out Apple. I'm shocked at Amazon. Shady sellers like All Out Apple will always be around, but I really thought Amazon was better than Ebay in that way. Lesson Learned.There is no reason a MacBook Air should have a display of a completely stops functioning after six months of use, even refurbished. I’m grateful that I had a work-provided monitor I can plug into to do my schoolwork, but if I was aiming to be tethered to my desk, I would have bought a Mac Mini."
703,"Got the computer two days early! this was probably the fastest delivery I've ever received from amazon. I wasn't going to buy refurbished but I really wanted another MacBook and shelling out $2k for a new one was simply out of the question. When I saw the price for this MacBook Air, I decided to roll the dice and buy it. I knew it could possibly come not as advertised, such as having scratches or not being updated as far as software is concerned but when I opened it up it was practically BRAND NEW! set up was simple as can be! only took me 5 minutes to sign in with my Apple ID and all my information was synced between my iPhone and iPad and onto the MacBook Air. There were a few minor scratches less than a couple centimeters on the bottom of the computer nothing that noticeable. the charger doesn't stick as well as I'd like and one of the hinges is half broken off but I've that same issue with practically every MacBook I've ever had. I was really surprised with the quality. it said 2017 version but with all the updates and new iterations its hard to gauge which MacBook your getting I thought I was purchasing a much older MacBook Air than what I got this thing is amazing and the 13 in screen is far larger than I expected it to be feels like a 15 or 17 in display when having it in your hands/ the computer itself is incredibly light, the main reason I chose the air you can carry it in anywhere with one hand and hardly feel it definitely much lighter than my 2020 iPad 11"" All in all if you're on a budget, this computer is the way to go! for $400 its practically brand new and runs like a dream! thanks amazon for this incredible refurbished Mac! love it !"
704,"I don’t what to think I bought 2017 16gb 256 ssd but I received a refurbished 2019 8g 256 perfectly packaged, I can’t put apple care I already call for that but im not sure to keep it because I want a computer of 16of ram but this one is 2019, im gonna give the chance to see how it works, And it cost me the same price of a refurbished 2019 Of apple but those ones you can put apple care"
705,"hola, soy de peru. Estoy contento con la compra, la compre por el precio, y me llego tal cual las especificaciones.(late2018,2.3gz,8ram,256ssd). la bateria llego con 350 ciclos aproxen cuanto a lo estetico, tenia pequeños arañones en un costado, pero nada grave, la pantalla intacta y el touchbar ok. el cargador sellado oem.califico la compra como 9/10."
706,Got a few months out of this before the screen started disappearing intermittently. Then it wasn't so intermittent. I'd have much rather spent the extra money to get a new computer that didn't break than to buy something second-hand and have to decide to repair or replace.
707,"Considering I was 100% ripped off, I would not recommend you purchase from this seller, I did not receive what I wanted, the serial number for a COMPUTER comes up as an iPhone 11... Just.. No."
708,This computer was working fine and all of a sudden the screen went out.  Cost me $640 to fix it.
709,"Delivery was super fast, considering I’m in South Africa. The laptop is simply beautiful, woks well, no complaints, I love it."
710,"Positivo, EXCELENTE EQUIPO!!!"
711,So far this was a steal. Great product for a great value.
712,super machine
713,The space key and some of the keys were not working As they are supposed to. Really sticky
714,"Arrived, boxed well with balloon cushions. Power adapter looked clean but had scratches. Opened up the Lid of the MacBookPro and it looked like it had some sort of disease or cancer & it smelled quite strange too. It had over 50% battery so I carried on with a reset which resulted in an error. Luckily it booted back into Yosemite OS that it had installed years ago, after 3 failed attempts managed to update to Mojave. Of course first things first copy music etc onto, USB stick struggled to go in either of the USB Ports (look at the photos) was also stuck after insertion but managed to pull out, with a hard pull - full force - anger. Had a look into the ports and discovered they were literally rusted dirty like disgusting, this is not the definition of Refurbished - but 2nd Hand or Heavily Used. Be aware, set your expectations right in oder to avoid any disappointments."
715,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I was super stoked upon arrival, began setting up the laptop and within minutes the screen stopped working. Literally pixels. Severely disappointed. I have gotten ahold of kanga and they are working to replace the device but it has now been over a week since I’ve purchased the unit with two day shipping and still have nothing to show for it. I hope they come through on their end and send me a functional unit."
716,"I've only had it for about a week now and this 2015 MacBook Pro is working phenomenally! I was kinda hesitant buying a refurbished MacBook from Amazon, but I can honestly say I'm go glad I went ahead and did. It came extremely fast and right from opening the box, it was as if I had bought a brand new one right from Apple themselves. There's not a scratch, dent, stain, dust or anything on it. So far it's working extremely well and I will definitely buy form this seller in the future and recommend them to others as well! Great price for a great computer."
717,"I’ve had this MacBook Pro going on 4 days and so far so good! It has met all my expectations and more. I grew up using windows PCs. This is my first Apple computer and I’m happy to have made the transition. Wish I did this long time ago but better late then never. If it wasn’t for the packaging and not being in the original box, I probably wouldn’t be able to tell this was refurbished. This is just based from my experience using MacBooks at the Apple store. Also, there was a few minor scratches on the bottom of the laptop.I will revise and change review in a month if any problems. But as of now, my review above is how I feel."
718,"I've only had it for a couple days, but so far this is a great purchase. The thing looks brand new, and I know it isn't. I am replacing an older Mac and just can't afford the prices of new machines from Apple. Using Migration Assistant (an app that comes with Macs) I was able to restore a time machine backup from the old machine, so I've lost nothing in the transition."
719,"When I ordered this product for the first time, it came with a green line on the screen. I contacted the costumer service, they responded very quickly and replaced it.The second computer came with better specs, I was the happiest person... for 2 months though, the computer suddenly stop responding.Other things that are worth saying:- The charger is generic. A generic charger can easily damage the battery of the computer, that could explain my problem.- The second computer they sent, had a sticker that covered the whole low part of the computer (those stickers that are the same color as the computer and are used to cover up very big scratches.Conclusion: they can deliver a great costumer service, but not a working product."
720,"The macbook pro only worked for a short while. It had a charging/powering problem - wouldn't keep a charge at first, then wouldn't power on even when plugged in. Confirmed it was not a charger issue.I contacted the company who said to send it back for repair. Once they received it they wrote saying it cannot be fixed and charged me a ""restocking fee"" in the amount of the purchase of the laptop. Outrageous!! I even had a protection plan for it. After numerous interactions they refused to help and returned the laptop without telling me. THEN they said they couldn't do anything in terms of a refund because I had the machine. Months later they refuse to resolve it and amazon can't help me because it's a third party seller. An ABSOLUTE JOKE of a company. I'm out over $500.00 with a computer that can't be fixed - and Apple store said they could try but for more than the computer's worth. So yeah. They have my money and I have nothing.DO NOT BUY from these people if you'd like to keep your money."
721,"Hey all! So I’ve gotten into photography lately and needed a upgrade from my old 2012 MacBook Pro and 2011 Asus laptops for editing. Figured a 2015 model would be the way to go for a decent upgrade without spending tons of money. I was super skeptical about buying a reconditioned one through Amazon after reading the reviews and thought about it for about 4 hours before I made the transaction. Next day it was at my door step with me a bit nervous about opening the package and seeing a beat up MacBook, I opened the box and the MacBook was in a bubble wrapped sleeve and that’s it. Okay I’m fine with that but what was the condition of it? Looks like it barely got used or the previous owner always had a case on it. Outside from a few nicks here and there it’s flawless. Turns on and is super quick, the Retina display is beautiful and definitely enjoyable to watch movies. It came with Mojave so the first thing I did was update it to Big Sur and it’s still flawless. I’ve only had it for a day if that but so far I’m happy with my purchase. Just be mindful yours may or may not be like mine condition wise I got lucky. Should you buy one of these? I would I’m pleased with my purchase and I’m sure you would be too. But I’ll update with any issues if they come up in the future. Thankfully I’m a bit tech savvy so whatever happens I’m sure I can fix it."
722,"This of course this is an old model and reconditioned/renewed, so I was expecting it to look somewhat used; however, this MacBook Pro is in PERFECT CONDITION as if I had purchased it new. I'm upgrading from a very heavy and slow 2009 white MacBook that's a dinosaur and I could only do very basic things on it. It has almost zero capability in terms of battery life (it could only be used plugged in) so this laptop is an absolute gem in comparison. This might be why I'm so hyped and elated. Plus the price was very good. *I hope the computer doesn't have some sudden glitch and dies on me...lol!Now, I can finally edit my videos in iMovie, which was not working on the old MacBook, because I couldn't update it anymore. I need this laptop mainly for traveling, to do editing work, I have a 2 monitor PC set-up at home. My only wish is that I could transfer my Adobe CS to the new laptop.SIDE NOTE: it's actually overall a little smaller than my old 13"" (screen size is the same), it's not as heavy, but not as light as the Air; it arrived with Catalina iOS installed and I had to upgrade to Monterey to use the newest version of iMovie - this isn't a complaint, just an observation."
723,"I bought for my mom, great deal (sort-of), works great (after I deleted 2 mysterious old unknown wifi connections)I bought this for my mom, she was always having Windows problems, viruses disguised as virus removal, scammy pop-ups, and so on.  Happy day!  :DThey raised prices during Prime Day, wth?  I thought I was getting a good deal, but afterward I noticed the price went down.  Anyway, I ordered this for my mom.  She's been using Windows and I wanted her to experience a Macbook Pro.  This one is actually even better than mine!  I'm still happily using a Late 2013 2.4 Ghz 8 RAM 256 GB 13-inch Retina, her's is exactly the same except it's a Early 2015 and it's actually got 2.7 Ghz!  Anyway she seems really happy with it.  I set it up for her, and ran the serial number, which was not found, not surprisingly although I'm not sure what that means, and the update page in the App Store looks like it was coded in 1995, so I'm not sure what's up with that.  Could be something funky going on, but all I know is it works and we're happy with it.  She's getting used to using it, and she says it's fast and smooth.  She was getting tired of all the Windows updates and virus stuff and all the spammy popups telling her to purchase a virus disguised as virus removal, yadda yadda yadda, so I am well-pleased that she is now almost a full-blown Mac-head.  Thanks Apple.  I hope to be able to afford an Apple car when they do come out, haha.  I'm not sure about the battery-life yet, but I HAD TO replace the battery on mine, so replacing it on hers should not be a problem."
724,It’s just one continuous problem after the other with this computer. It’s really not worth it to save a little bit of money just buy new not refurbished have your warrantee you’re better off in the long run.
725,For this being my first ever Mac- This was an amazing buy... no scratches or dents. Its basically BRAND NEW. 😝😝😝The only thing is that it says 512gb but the space says 256gb so be wary of that.But other than that I am really happy with my purchase.
726,Good
727,Love it
728,"the product arrived with the screen broken. I would like a refund of $ 400 to repair it, since he is now in Brazil."
729,So happy with this purchase. Even my kids said it looks like the new ones. Has some minor imperfections but at the cost totally acceptable. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.
730,"I purchased through amazon this m1 chip 512 gb 8ram macbook pro 2020 year manufacture.  I’m a mac user of many years.  The computer is blazing fast, slim, light with great battery life. A huge bonus—-little need for additional  anti virus add on software since the macbook anti virus platform is very solid. A hidden gem when you buy any apple device is phenomenal tech telephone support.  The advisors at the apple stores and by telephone are the best part of the apple experience for me and even rival the devices they sell. Yes, I hate the high prices and know the game but over time I’ve  accepted their price points because of the incredible tech support."
731,battery would not take any charge  stuck at 1%
732,"I cannot believe the condition my Macbook is in, you can’t even tell if it’s used and the packaging was very nice and professional with the white box and wrapped just like it is when you get it directly from Apple. I am super happy with my purchase, thanks Amazon."
733,"Good, but it is a little small.. easy to control. Recommend if you are hard to control your computer"
734,Computer will not charge.
735,"""Refurbished"" even though Battery life was non existent from the startup, always check the reviews on laptops to make sure they have over 200, cause then you won't be played by greedy ass people like I was"
736,"Minor scratches , for the price reduction is a great buy !!!"
737,Light weight
738,"El producto reacibdiocionado en muy buen estado, funciona perfectamente y venía totalmente protegido y embalado. Muy satisfecho con la compra"
739,"Looks and acts brand new. Everything exactly as advertised. Will update if I have any issues but after a week I can say, I am pleasantly surprised!"
740,"This is an unusually large advance over previous models, especially in raw computing power, but also in fun things like screen and headphone support.This Amazon listing has two different processors, the M1 Pro (listed as 16-Core GPU ""style"") and the M1 Max (32-Core GPU). I'll call one the Pro, the other the Max. I got the base Pro, but much of what I'll say applies to both, and I'll have some comments specifically about the Max too. (MBP below = MacBook Pro.)Amazon doesn't offer most of the options you can get, only the ones listed. For now (and probably later), that's the Pro with 16GB RAM and 512GB or 1TB SSD, or the Max with 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD. 3 versions total.Screen Brightness* and HappinessThis screen can get up to 1600 nits brightness and can sustain full-screen brightness up to 1000. That's very impressive, as MBPs since 2016 have topped out at 500.*But the vast majority of the time, this screen will also top out at 500, because those other numbers are only for HDR (high dynamic range, what Apple calls XDR), i.e. some videos and some photos viewed in some programs. If you're browsing the internet, using productivity apps, or the like, those are almost all SDR (standard dynamic range). You'll be seeing them at the same brightness as with MBPs for the last five years.That said, the new screen is beautiful and bright in both HDR and SDR for most situations. For HDR, it puts out more color and brightness, and darker blacks - a million-to-one contrast ratio - with a wider range of light and color that has more pop and more detail in shadows and highlights. It can be dazzling or just more realistic.For SDR, it's much like before, still a gorgeous screen, with better contrast than before because of darker blacks.Has more pixels per inch (254, up from 226), and more pixels all over (3456 by 2234, up from 3072 by 1920). The aspect ratio remains 16:10 (not counting the top menu bar).ProMotionProMotion is Apple's name for screen refresh rates that can go up to 120Hz, or lower to save processor/battery power when 120 isn't needed. This makes motion smoother, more natural.For now where ProMotion applies is limited. Most scrolling in browsing, including with Safari, still tops out at 60Hz. Which is fine for me, but it bothers some people, looks choppy to them. This could be changed with a software update.Bloom and GhostsBloom is when a bright spot on a dark background bleeds out past where it's supposed to be, a common issue with this kind of screen. I and most others think this screen handles it well (better than the iPad Pro), but it can still arise some.Ghosting is when a moving object leaves a noticeable trail of ghost images behind for a fraction of a second, one for each new frame until the old image fades. MBPs are notoriously mediocre at this kind of ghostbusting, and this screen is no exception. Expect the usual haunting, if you notice that kind of thing.PWMFor those concerned (you mostly know who you are), there is PWM (pulse-width modulation) on the smaller 14"" version of this screen, and so very likely on this one too, at a frequency of 14,880Hz at all brightness levels (measured by NotebookCheck). That's a very high frequency, considered well beyond what would cause trouble for the susceptible.The NotchAs you can see in the main photo here, there's a black Notch at the top of the screen. There are no pixels there. The long-desired improved camera is there, and a mic array and light sensor (and maybe room for a Face ID system if they decide to make MBPs with that). As with the iPhone Notch, it's controversial.You can make the Notch disappear, or rather blend in, if you make the background up there black. It also disappears into the black bars when you view things like videos in full-screen mode.The cursor disappears into the Notch if you put it there. If an app has menu items that stretch there, they disappear too, but they'll still function normally if you put the (invisible) cursor on them.Desperate times call for desperate measures. Most apps won't have this trouble, but if you must, you can avoid menu items disappearing by using the ""Scale to fit"" function, which shrinks the entire screen work area a little to fit below the Notch. Makes it look like an old 15"" if the background is black, like there are wide black bezels. (Google ""Scale to fit below built-in camera"" for full instructions and mockery.)There are also third-party apps, such as Bartender, to manage how items appear in the menu bar and keep them visible.Camera and MicsThe new camera that, along with the thinner bezels, makes the Notch necessary, is 1080p, with an f/2 lens for good exposure in the shadows. Video looks noticeably better than before, though it can have a processed look.The three mics sound very clean and natural but with a little less bass than before to my ears, which is fine.Extra ScreensYou can use two external monitors with the Pro, down from four with previous models. They can be up to 6K @60Hz with a billion colors. The Max can still use four: three 6K and one 4K, all @60Hz etc.You can use 4K @120/144Hz HDR monitors too.You can run two from one port if you use the right kind of dock or daisy-chain.Headphone OomphThe new headphone jack has more power for high-impedance headphones. It automatically adjusts, so it won't overwhelm low-impedance phones. If the headphones have less than 150 ohms impedance, they get 1.25 volts RMS. If more, 3 volts. That might cause it to fail to provide enough power to some not-so-high-impedance headphones that still require extra power, such as planars.With my 2016 15"" MBP, I've had to use a portable amp for my Beyerdynamic DT 1990 Pros (250 ohm), but now I can pretty well do without it, though sometimes only just. The volume on some sources is still not always what I wish I could make it. But now I can nearly achieve hearing loss with the intro to the guitar riff in ""Money for Nothing."" Which also sounds good, and healthier, a couple notches down.Among other headphones that have tested favorably with the new jack are the DT 990 Pros (250 ohm), and the Sennheiser HD650, 660S, 6XX, and HD800 (150 to 300 ohm).One report says the planar Hifiman HE4XXs (35 ohm planar) sound good, but most planars tested are said to need more power. The Audeze LCD-2Cs are reported to sound good enough, though not their best. The LCD-3s and Hifiman Sundaras and Aryas are said to be underpowered.For my usual regular-impedance phones, Cleer Flow IIs (16 ohm), the wired volume is a little louder than before, though still not always the earsplitting barrage I want for some sources. Maybe for the best.Quality iems (in-ear monitors) that require especially clean input, but not too much, reportedly sound good, including Andromedas and Moondrop Starfields.SpeakersThey're improved from the already laptop-leading speakers from earlier MBPs, with a fuller sound and decent kick, amazingly good for when nothing with a 3"" woofer is around.Apple mysteriously says the 14"" M1 has the same speaker system, but looking inside both machines shows the speakers in the 16"" are bigger - both ""subs"" and tweeters - and located differently, with the subs in the front corners on this one. The 16"" has fuller bass (such as it is).Heat and NoiseThere isn't any.None with my typical use, at least. If you push it hard, it can get warm, but not as hot as my 2016 15"". Which makes sense, as this has a larger enclosure, bigger fans, larger, better heat sinks, and more power-efficient processors. The fans don't have to spin up as much to do the same amount of cooling, so it's noticeably quieter even when it does heat up, rarely makes any noise at all.The 16"" Max comes with a larger heat sink than the 16"" Pro, so likely runs a little cooler and quieter sometimes, though the Max might get hotter when it uses a lot of that extra power.KeyboardVery quiet, much like the older Mac laptop keyboards, not the butterfly ones from 2015-19, but the rest. Maybe less travel in the keys than some of those, but plenty for me.I miss the touch bar sliders for fine control of some functions, but you can still use sliders via the Control Center, the icon next to the date on the screen's top menu bar. That's also where control of the keyboard backlight is, no more control for it on the keyboard.TouchpadThe best available by far, responsive and large so you can carry the cursor over a large area with more control. For clicks, it's great. For taps, which I turn off, it's not as great, according to those who prefer that - appears to be a software issue.PortsThere's one less Thunderbolt/USB-C port than before, but 50% more bandwidth (3 controllers instead of 2).The HDMI is 2.0, can drive up to 4K HDR @60Hz.The SD card reader is shallow, so the cards stick out. There might be room for a flush micro-SD adapter. I only have cards up to 64GB, which work fine. Some people have had trouble reading some cards, so it may be finicky.Battery LifeI usually keep plugged in, but the reviews I've seen that cover battery life tests typically say it's the longest of any similar machine they've tested, including PCs. Reports of battery life for office work, browsing, watching videos, and so on generally range from 10 to 16 hours, sometimes more. It can go unusually long with heavy use too, 5 hours or more of video work, for example. Max Tech did 10 benchmark and stress tests with it in a couple hours, some maxing out the CPU or GPU for up to ten minutes, and it still had 36% left.At normal settings, there's no performance hit until you get down to 3%; until then you can process or game at full tilt. There's a low-power mode that extends battery life by limiting performance, lowering screen brightness, etc. The Max also has a high-power mode, but it seems to only ramp up the fans sooner to help cooling. Apple's description and tests in reviews indicate it doesn't affect performance in any direct way.The Max has tended to have a little less battery life than the Pro in reviews. The only good tests I've seen that compared directly either found negligible differences or up to 15% less battery life for the Max. (Other tests haven't been well controlled.)You can quick charge to 50% in a half-hour. The new power brick is 45% more powerful than before, and maybe 30% larger lengthwise, still small for what it does. You can charge at lower speed with smaller bricks (not included) via the USB-C ports.Size and WeightIt's noticeably heavier than before, about 5 ounces over the previous 16"", and not quite as sleek, but it's sleeker than I was expecting from the photos.RepairabilityHa ha! But really, it's better than it was. Battery modules now have pull tabs so they can be more easily replaced. The screen can be replaced more easily, but if Apple doesn't do it you lose True Tone (which I don't want anyway). The headphone, Thunderbolt and MagSafe ports can be replaced without replacing the logic board. Now rates a 4/10 from iFixit for repairability, up from 1/10 for the previous model.CompatibilityComes with Rosetta 2, which enables M1 Macs to use programs written for Intel Macs, and usually works very well.There's no more Boot Camp, so to run Windows or Windows programs you have to use third-party software like Parallels, which runs Windows by emulating a Windows machine (and requires a Windows license), or Crossover, which modifies Windows programs to run on Macs.  Which works best, or at all, depends on the program.GamingWoW *mostly* runs 50 to 120fps at high settings and resolution, depending on the location. Some places can't even manage 50 at those settings, though, but do OK at more compromised settings. Baldur's Gate 3, Diablo III, CS:GO and several others can run at 60-100fps or better at good settings.You can play Windows games via Parallels or Crossover. They generally don't run as well, but some do fine.Most games, including native ones, run quite a bit better on the Max, with up to 2x the fps. Final Fantasy XIV is hit and miss at good settings even with the Max.Gaming isn't usually hot or noisy, can get warmer with light fans for the games that aren't running natively. And there's no noticeable performance hit for gaming on battery.WorkI have to mention the less fun part: how well this does things you might have to do at work. It does almost all of it better than before, much of it way better. Here's how it compares according to actual test results from numerous sources with Xcode, Logic Pro, Lightroom, Blender, Final Cut Pro, Premiere Pro, and so on. The range of comparison depends on what the task is.Previous base MBP 16"" (Intel i7 AMD 5300): The Pro is 60% to several times faster.Previous top-spec'd MBP (i9 5600M): The Pro is about the same to 2 or 3 times faster.Regular M1 machines (not M1 Pro or Max): The Pro is about the same to several times faster.The 14"" M1 Pro with same specs: The same, though the 16"" has the bigger battery and heat removal system, so it fares better in those ways.Windows laptop work stations: This is complicated, but the Pro can thrash most Windows laptops in most intensive work-related apps. It lines up very roughly with machines with a good i7/i9 and an RTX 3070, but generally can't keep up with the RTX 3080. The Pro uses a fraction of the power, and so only produces a fraction of the heat and noise, if any. And lasts and performs much better on battery.Pro vs MaxThe Max is about the same to twice as fast as the Pro, mostly between those extremes. The CPU is much the same, but the GPU is double the cores, so the main advantage is in graphics-heavy work.Besides the GPU cores, the Max has twice the bandwidth for memory transfer, two hardware video encode engines instead of one, and some extra cooling capacity.If you're already successfully using a Mac laptop, you don't *need* the Max, since the Pro is already better than what you have. But that doesn't mean you can't benefit from the Max's extra power if you have the money. For intensive video editing, massive photo editing, or better gaming (though cheaper Windows machines will play most games better), the Max has real advantages.To confuse things a little more, Apple (but not Amazon currently) also offers a demi-Max with a 24-core GPU, halfway between the Pro's 16 and the Max's 32. It's a cheaper way to get the extra bandwidth, video encoder, and cooling advantages of the Max. Tests show that in graphics-intensive tasks it operates roughly midway between the Pro and 32-core Max, often more than half, as expected.WarrantiesThis comes with a one-year limited warranty against manufacturing defects that includes free phone support for the first 90 days. If you want to also cover accidental damage (with deductibles) and extend the regular warranty and free tech support to 3 years, you can buy 

AppleCare+ from Amazon

   (link embedded) or Apple. You get 60 days from purchase to buy it, but coverage for accidents doesn't start until you do. (I always self-insure when I can, so I didn't get it.)DecalsLast and least, this comes with two black Apple decals, the sign of true professional Apple equipment."
741,Out of the box unusable for me. This MacBook Pro does not have any USB ports to be able to restore from a previous Mac back up that’s on an external drive. You must buy an adapter. Since I live in a remote area I’d have to order online and wait. You cannot even plug a iPhone12 Pro Max directly into it. The only ports it has are thunderbolt. So even Apple’s own lighting connector needs an adapter. The keyboard is a downgrade from the old keyboard. Solid black plastic instead of plastic keys surrounded by aluminum which were easier to see. Had to call Apple support to download an update because there is no reset option in the System Preferences of OS Monterey. And the update did not work to give it that option. Will have to figure out a different option to remove my account and information to return it. This particular MacBook is defective I believe.
742,I ordered the 2021 16 inch right away as I knew they would probably sell out fast. I had to make sure I had one for my trip I am leaving on soon.  As soon as I opened it the screen would never come on.  Thought maybe it needed charging so I tried that.  Still nothing but a black screen.  It kept making the sound when you open it up even when it was closed over and over again.  I took it to the local Apple Store hoping I could get some answers.  They tired to get it to work and could not either.  They said it is very strange and maybe something happened to it during shipping.  They said since it is brand new it would be best to get my money back from Amazon.  I thought maybe I could just exchange it before my trip but the one I ordered is out of stock.  I will try the 14 inch and see if I like it compared to the size of the 16 inch since it is in stock.  This is a first MacBook Pro I have ever purchased and now I am a bit nervous.
743,"Here are the temperature results for the new cool MacBooks compared to the old overheating intel ones. 91 degrees for the old one near the processor, and 74 degrees on the new ones. Both had been running for hours transferring files nonstop. Amazing. I have been editing video, transferring large files and not once have the fans kicked on. Makes me want to cry."
744,"Finally, this 2021 MacBook Pro cured my depression!"
745,Arrived DOA - wouldn’t start up. Spent hours on the phone with Apple support and still wouldn’t start. Returned - c’mon man!
746,"This laptop is unbelievably fast. Between the screen, battery life, and performance, this laptop is head and shoulders better than any competition."
747,My first ever MacBook. Switched over from PC and I can't believe I didn't switch sooner! On the pricer side but I'm super happy with my purchase!
748,"I have been using my MacBook Pro from 2014 for work until last week when I finally purchased this MacBook Pro. My old MacBook starts up and works as fast as the day I bought it. The only reason I bought a new MacBook was because the battery life was getting low. I probably could have just bought a new battery and it would have been fine.That being said, I did hold out for this MacBook because Apple brought back the ports that I needed. I use the HDMI and SD ports daily. An Ethernet port would have been nice but that’s asking too much. This MacBook has a 2 day battery life and is blazing fast. I use Adobe programs and this MacBook doesn’t even blink when I do live editing. Best laptop I have ever used.I own a business that uses many PC laptops and a couple MacBooks. A PC will never last as long as a MacBook. And, a PC ALWAYS gets slower after 6 months of use. The price is high but you can buy a new PC every 2 years or a MacBook every 7 years."
749,"Coming from a 2019 16in, I feel that this generation is 2 steps forwards, 1 step back.Pros:-Fans are never audible even under full extended load!  This was my #1 issue with my 2019 mac which would have constant fan noise with 2 monitors.-2x battery life-Better screen especially in dark environment or a dark subject-Extremely fast for certain workloads such as video editing and code compilation.-magsafe is back (although I personally don't care for it)-most apps work normally with rosetta emulation, but may have some stutter.Cons:-thicker and SIGNIFICANTLY heavier.-Screen has a notch which is very distracting for me.-Still has some compatibility issues.-Terrible for games.  Only a few titles are supported natively.  I only tested league of legends(uses rosetta emulator), but it was choppy and 1/3 the fps of my 2019 intel macbook.- +$300 base price even though they got rid of intel.-The area I feel apple has made a major misstep is with ports.  I couldn't care less for SD card or HDMI, but everyone who buys this is going to need USB-A.  It's ridiculous that I still have to bring a dongle everywhere just to use my mouse but these ports I never/rarely use are back.Also some developer related tools/libraries aren't working.C# debugger is totally unsupported for example.  Anything that requires gpu hardware acceleration (pytorch) is unlikely to ever be supported in any usable form.  Linux dual boot is unsupported or in early experimental stages.  I also had issues building/running java projects natively, but no issues with rosetta.If you're looking to buy this for an undergrad program, it's probably workable.  However, I'd suggest saving some $ and getting a used mac or windows machine.  Professional devs will be aware of their specific requirements, but I suspect many will need to keep a secondary x86 machine for the foreseeable future."
750,"I am writing this review focused primarily on people who are considering jumping from the 13"" MacBook Pro to the 14"" MacBook Pro, which is what I did. I moved from the 13"" MacBook Pro M1 with 16gb of RAM to the 14"" MacBook Pro M1 Pro with 16gb of RAM.Size: So, 1"" of screen might not seem like a lot on its face, but the difference is pretty substantial, in my opinion. Even the pictures don't quite do it justice. The screen feels considerably larger in a package that isn't considerably larger. For me, it's the perfect sweet spot for someone who wants something larger than the 13"" model, but smaller than the 16"". I had a 16"" MacBook Pro i9 and it was just too much for me. This one feels perfect.Form Factor: The new 14"" and 16"" MacBooks both adopt a thicker chassis, which is shown in the pictures. As such, Apple decided to make the casing flat instead of gently rounded. It honestly reminds me of the pre-unibody builds, but still sleek and modern. If I didn't know this one was new and you just laid them side-by-side, I might say that the old form factor looks a little newer, but that isn't to say that it looks bad.Aesthetics: Overall, I touched on the aesthetics a bit in the ""form factor"" section. It looks like a high-end laptop, but at the same time I can see some people thinking it looks dated. I personally like the flatter look over the more rounded look, but it will depend on the person. Another thing I like is moving the ""MacBook Pro"" branding from under the screen to the bottom of the casing. I just think it provides a cleaner look during use. The black background of the keyboard is also a plus for me. The old space gray background was fine, but I really like the black.Function: Most people probably won't notice a massive difference in the previous iteration and the new iteration. For the 14"" and 16"" MacBook Pros, the touchbar has been removed. This will make a lot of people happy. For me, I was always pretty ambivalent about the touchbar, but I'm not going to complain about a key row there. The keyboard appears to have ever so slightly more travel and bounce. It's not a huge amount, but it is noticeable. I'll touch on The Notch later.Performance: My 13"" had the M1 chip and now my 14"" as the M1 Pro. So far, I haven't noticed a tremendous difference when using programs like Logic Pro, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Lightroom, but I wouldn't say those are super intensive programs. If you're exporting massive 8K videos, you might want to jump up to the M1 Max. One thing I have noticed is that the thermals are maybe a little bit worse. Just a touch. I have noticed it warming up a bit, but the fan still has not come on once. I only mention this because my 13"" M1 stayed cold at all times. It's not as bad as my i9, which sounded like a jet engine revving up while it jumped well over 100 degrees, but it's something to be aware of.The Notch: Honestly, so much has been made of the notch and I think it's mostly overstated. Yes, it's fun to meme the fact that Apple still hasn't found a way around the notch, particularly on iPhones, but it's really not a huge deal. Were it up to me, I would have just left a bezel up there, but I can understand why Apple didn't. I use a Dell XPS for work and it has razor thin bezels with no notch, but at the same time the camera is an absolute joke. Looks like it's from 2002.The Notch (cont'd): The notch behavior can be inconsistent from app to app, but not to the point where it's bothersome. I have seen some programs with very large nav menus up top bump the status bar out of the way to make room. And while this particular phenomenon is not something new for MacBooks, losing a big chunk of that bar to the notch will likely make this a more regular occurrence for people. Do I wish it didn't have a notch? Yeah, probably. Does it hurt the experience? Very, very little.Screen: For everyday indoor use, which is almost exclusively what I do, I think you will be hard-pressed to find a better screen on the market. The 120Hz refresh rate is something I waited a long time to get on the iPhone, so I was pretty shocked to see it implemented on the new MacBook Pros just a month later. It actually has more pixels/inch than the iMac 27"" 5K screen, which I also use pretty regularly. All-in-all, the screen is just the best in the business.Overall: It's a great and powerful laptop for someone who is wanting a little more than web surfing and word processing. I use mine primarily for recording music, as well as live performances using standalone plugins, so I need something that is powerful and easy to use. The MacBook Pro has always fit the bill, but now with the M1, M1 Pro, and M1 Max chips, I have absolutely no concern for performance or consistency.My 13"" M1 did just what I needed in this regard, but I'm someone who wanted a slightly larger screen without drastically increasing my footprint and weight. The 14"" MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip is just what I needed. If you're someone who needs absolutely top notch performance, I'd recommend upgrading the RAM and going with the M1 Max."
751,"I haven't upgraded my computer for more than a decade, so it would stand to reason any recent releases would impress me, but this macbook pro has gone above and beyond in the small time I've had it.The screen is truly something to behold. Smooth, clear, just beautiful. I don't typically care about bezels, but I might start. The expanded screen makes an unexpected difference. Meanwhile, I barely notice the notch. Apple said they'd find workarounds to make it scarce, and they have.The speakers are wonderful as well. I was skeptical at first -- thought I caught some tinny effects on a couple songs, but the more I listen to them, the more I'm convinced the tinniness was in the recording (it was a live album, which might explain it). As for the spatial audio, I've only heard a couple songs, but it's pretty trippy. This is my first experience with it, and it doesn't disappoint.In the short time I've had the computer, it's been nothing but fast. Probably more computer than I need, so if you're a sound editor or photographer, this review probably isn't for you. But for those of you casual users who want a solid machine that will last (as I said, my last macbook pro made it more than a decade), this is the one. Excited as I was for my last macbook, I could see room for improvement at the time. Right now, I don't see how things get better than this."
752,"M1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. Compared to previous MacBook Pro, it's a giant leap ahead. These tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the Macbook. This particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro,  but it still kicks butt. You can get the Pro Max chip and bump up the RAM to 64GB if you want - and add tons more storage. The 14 inch MacBook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. It can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. The display is stunning. Just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. The brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. Real HDR viewing -  a big difference. You will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. After 10 minutes I don't even notice it. It means nothing for your experience. Its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. Camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous MacBooks. Six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. Music/movies it feels like surround sound. For video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. The keyboard is a dream to type on. Very solid like all MacBooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. The Apple Magic Keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. Battery life is amazing. I have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. At best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! Especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it won't be 17 hours but I did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. The power efficiency is ground breaking. They have added back the MagSafe power plug - which is great! And added back an SD card slot and and an HDMI port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. I wish it had at least one USB-A old style port - but it doesn't. You get three USB-C thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. They got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro MacBooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. Apparently they listened to a lot of users who didn't really like the touch pad. The shape and style of this laptop is great. Some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. That is BS. I have been typing most of the day and I don't feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. Very comfy for typing. Some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new Macbook Pro, but I am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside -  this is an amazing laptop - the best Apple has ever made, hands down. And I would say you won't find a better power laptop anywhere.  All that said - this is not a gamers machine. Apple is not for hard core gamers. I mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. I am a hard core gamer and a PC geek  - I have a powerful windows PC for gaming. And always will. But for everything else. this MacBook is king. I use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. I can plut into a giant monitor if I want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch IPS panel. So if you are wondering if this Macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - I am here to tell you, its the real deal. I finally upgraded from my 2015 MacBook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. If you are thinking of getting one - you won't be disappointed. One last comment. I am an old timer windows guy, and I know all the counter arguments for the Mac. Many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. First, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new M1 Pro chips - you can't. And aside from that, the Mac OS is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text FROM A PHOTO! Whaaat? And the design/ergonomics/quality of these MacBooks is unmatched. So, yes you pay more - but you get more. My last MacBook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. If you want this laptop - get it! It rocks."
753,"I have a Mabook Pro covered by Apple care. The computer needs a new battery. To make a long story short Apple left me for months with a computer, again under warranty, which I can use for a couple of hours for simple tasks like web browsing before it needs to be recharged. Apple refused to replace the battery because the diagnostic read 81% not below 80 % as per policy. In all this Apple didn’t have any problems asking me to invest countless hours of my time between doing clean installs trips to apple stores etc.. I feel a more respectful way to treat me as a loyal customer could have been let us replace the battery first and if that doesn’t fix the issue which I seriously doubt ask me to do troubleshooting. All this to save something that would probably cost you few $$. Seriously ?"
754,sent me base model
755,"I probably got a faulty laptop but the charger status doesn’t show it’s charging when plugged in, only thing indicating that it’s charging is the orange light. My chrome windows keeps crashing whenever I put the computer to sleep and the external video display rarely connects"
756,"I never write reviews, but feel compelled to write one for this Macbook Pro. I've owned macs consistently since 1990s and have dealt with eye strain on the air and now on this laptop. It gave me horrible headaches and eye strain even with a matte protector. I returned it and am now looking at PCs for the first time because if I can't read from the screen without it making me sick, I can't use it."
757,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   My first MacBook ever! I had been saving up for it before the official drop— & I was not disappointed! Love the Touch ID feature, and it’s so efficient! Can’t wait to use it when I go back to school!"
758,"This laptop has a superior display, superior speakers, superior camera and an excellent keyboard. Don't go cheap and buy the ""affordable"" MacBook Air base model like some of these talking heads have been advising. It's not a good buy if you are unhappy with it after six months, and believe me, you will be unhappy with 8 GB of RAM and two USB ports after six months. M1 MacBooks are not upgradeable so if you find that you need more RAM, you are stuck. Unless all you are doing sending emails, tweets, and watching TicTok, you will probably need something more, especially if you are using your laptop for work. I'm using my MacBook Pro with an LG UltraFine 5K 27 inch display as my desktop system, which replaces a 27 inch iMac. I'm very happy."
759,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Sheeeese! What can I say? Apple has done it again 🤪😍 magnificent piece of device I must say."
760,I'm a fan of apple products and I like almost everything about this new MBA. But it has one huge flaw that nobody talks about. It's the camera hardware and it hasn't been updated in ages. My zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light. A $1000 laptop with 10 year old front camera is unacceptable. Camera is very important to me. Especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time.
761,"Liked:- Long battery life (one charge WILL last all day, i.e. 16 hours. Personally tested true)- Speed (the new M1 processor really is fast)- Quiet (no fan but the laptop still does not get hot)- Light and portable- High resolution & bright displayDisliked:- As with other MacBooks, the keyboard is mediocre especially compared to laptops like Lenovo Thinkpad- Incompatible applications (With the M1 processor still being new, you might experience existing programs frequently crash. For example, Chrome keeps crashing) But I would guess there will be a fix soon"
762,"UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable.The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long.Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using ""swap memory"" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board.***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB.I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models.There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD.***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly.------I purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12"" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1.The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco.I likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive ""Pro Apps"" running at the same time.I would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.I would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball ""not responding"" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1. If however, you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable, faster and cooler running than the Intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable Mac."
763,"The M1 chip really is amazing. But it only lasted five days for me. Somehow mine managed to break after using a third party USB C hub. The screen wouldn’t turn on at all, and an Apple repair tech couldn’t figure it out after doing a few quick tests. Oh and then Apple said it would take a month to replace it with a new one."
764,"Beautiful laptop. I’ve upgraded from the MacBook Air of old...so far this laptop has blown it away. It wasn’t overly pricey to be honest and I feel it’s worth the price. Overall look is great and keyboard feel is nice. Larger touchpad is great, I’ve paired my Magic Trackpad 2 with it as well."
765,"I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13"" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13"" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.Good:- SCREEN looks great!  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  I usually don't go above 50% brightness.- KEYBOARD is good.  Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard.  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic.  Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great.  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.- LOOKS GREAT.  Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.- NO FAN.  That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.- PERFORMANCE.  It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time.  For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU.  Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27"" (top end) with Intel chips.- TOUCH ID is great still.  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons.  On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA.  Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch).  You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay.  And so on and so forth.- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.NOT GOOD:- WEBCAM still sucks.  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc.  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27"" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera).- ONLY 2 PORTS.  Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort).  Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame.  I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.OVERALL:A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem.  Love it so far!"
766,No complains so far.  Very fast and performs great.  I had a 2014 MacBook Air and finally upgraded this year.  This is leagues beyond that entry and I’m very happy with this upgrade.
767,"Lightweight, blazing fast, easy to use, battery life is incredible with the new Apple M1 chip.  A typical Great Apple product.However, there is only a Thunderbolt port, so you now have to go out and buy a cable to convert USB to thunderbolt (if you want to use a backup hard drive) or other USB items, AND, I had to buy yet another cable to sync my phone's lightning port to the thunderbolt port on the computer. Total $56.I LOVE Apple product, and worked for them in my caerer, but I would wait on buying this version until the software for it has been developed.UPDATE: After several months of using this computer, I have have found several things of concern:1.  my notification center keeps disappearing, despite my constant reinstalling the widgets.2.  my computer's calendar, reminders, and photo stream do not sync with my IOS devices (iPhone & iPad).  If I add an item to calendar on my phone, it will appear on my mac but not vice versa.  Reminders will not sync regardless of which device I originate the item on.I have contacted Apple support on all these issues and they cannot solve the problem.IT APPEARS THAT THE BUGS HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED OUT, YET.  THINGS ARE MADDENINGLY CLUNKY!"

   Bought this laptop bc i needed it for spring semester and i needed an upgrade from my heavy macbook pro. I go to work too so i needed something super light and thin i can just bring everywhere and slide it in my bag.I am obsessed with how fast this macbook is. The battery life is on point. I used it for movies and series at work and it lasted for 3 days. The processor is definitely sooo good. I open so many tabs at once and it has not lagged on me. The keyboard and trackpad is responsive.I love the color. The main reason why i bought this too. 😍😂I have no problems with it at all.Highly recommend"
769,Opened my brand new $1000++ computer and the entire screen was cracked and destroyed. Awesome! Thanks Amazon.
770,"I pulled the trigger on this thing hoping that the bad reviews were wrong.. some of the comments saying it came dirty and defective definitely gave me pause however, what arrived today was practically a brand new macbook. the device does not show any signs of wear and the battery cycle count is 18, it came with the original power brick and while the cable was used, it was not worn or dirty in any way. While i've only just started using the device about an hour ago, I can tell you that it's speedy and works flawlessly... had I not known it was a refurb when buying it, I would have easily confused it for a brand new mbp.. for those asking, this is a 2017 macbook pro and the specs as quoted are accurate. i'll play around with this thing for a little while and update this review as needed, but so far this looks like a winner!***update***A few months in and it’s still working flawlessly. I don’t regret my purchase for one second, and neither should you!"
771,This is not a 256GB MacBook Pro- they are falsely advertising it as such and then shipping buyers 128GB versions.
772,"Came in used and dirty, and it was not even turn off, I'm gonna return it. So disappointed."
773,"Wow. I cant say enough how happy I am with this laptop! I it arrived early, and for a refurbished computer I swear it doesn't have a scratch, dent, smudge or single flaw anywhere on it! Its fast, the battery is great, its working perfectly! I couldn't be happier with this thing!"
774,"Was excited to receive it and on the outside it had one noticable chip in the case on the cover side (which had a sharp edge to it), but thought that isn't too bad.  But when opening it up the screen in both the top left and top right were broken/chipped/cracked like it had been dropped and they replaced the cover, but not the screen.  This was not acceptable.  Wanted to try it out and ended up learning that some of the keys did not work right (sticky, pushed strange and such), plus the touchpad/mouse was really strange and didn't seem to work correctly.  Too many issues out of the box for me and too concerned that there might be other issues from where it looked to have been dropped and such.  Sending it back and just started that process.  So far the return seems ok....but just hate that the product does not match the description...using their words ""Renewed products work and look like new""."
775,"I ordered the space gray with 256 gb of ram and received a silver with 128gb.  I knew this could happen as the picture did not match the description and I had seen other similar reviews.The good news is it was on time and in flawless condition.  I think I will stick with it and not press my luck, as it is still a fair price and a great machine, but beware."
776,"I have to admit, I don't typically write reviews and I was a little hesistant about the product due to some 1 to two star reviews. The space gray model not only is at a great price, it came to me brand new. With all the specs I was expecting, i5 8GB RAM 256GB SSD, and works like a dream. Battery life is great, setting up was easy, and all my Apple Products (iPhone, Apple watch, Earpods) synced with no issues. I'm not sure as to why there were so many negative reviews, but mine is not one of them. SO HAPPY!! I truly recommend."
777,the battery is dead
778,"This product arrived quickly and looked great.  There have been multiple glitches with the power switch and with the screen ever since it's arrival.  Most of the time the power button would require multiple attempts to push before the computer would power up.  When the computer woke from sleep state (opening lid after its been closed for at least fifteen minutes) the screen would be black and then all pixelated.  Most recently, the computer wouldn't even turn on, when it finally did, it was all reset and all the settings were reset.  I lost everything I had put on the computer over the past day.  The seller still hasn't gotten back to me after email and I left a voice message.  I have now initiated a return as I want my money back.  It would have been nice if they had gotten back to me ASAP when I emailed or when I called (during normal hours of operation, by the way) and it went to voicemail.  The fact that they didn't and the computer kept coming up with other issues.  I now will buy a new one.  The value is not there with the aggravation generated."
779,"Multiple reviews mentioned getting devices with used batteries, screen issues, etc.My laptop arrived through FedEx Express with questionable packaging. But everything was intact and fine. The laptop still had the plastic wrapped around it as MacBooks directly from Apple do, even with the screen cover. Only 3 battery cycles out of the box, with a new charger in the box. I am very satisfied with the purchase although in the Q&A section of this product someone mentions that this is a 2018 model, its not, its a 2017 (At least the one I received.) which for me isn't really a big deal since it arrived in exceptional condition. Highly recommend this MacBook."
780,"Delivered to me within 12 hours of purchase... Sealed in original apple packaging with protective film, blemish free, not a scratch.. Mint.its powerful, Ive already loaded some big task audio software and broadcast software on it and its flying through the multiple processes together at ease... (Logic 10.5 / Traktor DJ 3.0 / OBS)Super light and portable, If this is a MacBook Pro then I can't even imagine how light the Air models are. Nor could I even imagine why you may need something more powerful. I am having to adjust to the new keyboard and Touch Bar, I keep hitting Siri and volume settings, even as I type this.id also recommend getting a keyboard cover as well.... I hear these keyboards go out sometimes and to repair it. This is no fault to the reseller, but I can't believe Apple with their price points don't offer a bigger SSD for the lowest price point.... 128gb is laughable so be prepared to buy an external SSD along with a Thunderbolt 3 / USB-C Hub to run hdmi, and various external accessories.Overall I love this computer so far, it was a nail biter as I rarely ever shell out $1,000 on anything but I'm very pleased and satisfied with my purchase. And I still cannot find a better deal on the internet, not even used on Facebook marketplace, letgo or craigslist....Five stars"
781,So not worth it. All they want to do is take your money do NOT BUY THIS ONE! Its used and if you search apple on amazon they have brand new with higher stats for cheaper.
782,"Just received this, but so far so good. It looks BRAND NEW. There are literally NO signs of cosmetic wear or damage. It arrived in a sealed apple box. I’m finishing setting up and I already love it. For just under $1,200 for a 2019 model, this is a GREAT deal!"
783,"I really love my MacBook. I really love this laptop. I'm a huge MacBook fan and this works like new. So far I don't have a problem with the butterfly keyboard, but I heard bad reviews about the keyboard from watching YouTube videos. I think that they may have fixed the keyboard problem when they refurbished the product??? I'm not sure, but honestly this a really great laptop for a really great price. I do wish that it came in the original Apple box and packaging, but it wasn't far from the really deal."
784,"It looks and feels brand spanking new! Definitely happy with my purchase considering that I bought a brand new 2020 MacBook Air and hated it. Returned it back in 2 days. I paid a lot less for the Pro than the Air and its A LOT better with so many features. I’m not trying to persuade anyone out of getting the Air but if you are considering on buying a MacBook my advice would be to just go ahead and get the pro. The Air reminds me of a google chrome book slapped with an Apple logo on it. Not saying that google chrome books are bad, but there’s no need to pay a full band for the Air when you could find something similar and a lot cheaper. All in all I really love this laptop."
785,"Bought this laptop with some apprehensions, as i have typically bought refurbished goods from apple directly. This was my first from amazon, and i was not disappointed. The notebook was flawless, not a single scratch on it. second, all the accessories where flawless as well, not signs of usage. When i powered on the notebook to verify usage, the battery had cycled only 3 times, meaning it was still in new condition. Very highly recommended seller. Thanks for a pleasant transaction."
786,"This laptop looked new, straight from Apple store."
787,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   The screen arrived damaged, what a scam.!"
788,"Although I was very skeptical about purchasing a ""refurbished"" MacPro, after reading the reviews for this company, I made the purchase.  The MacPro arrived earlier than expected, expertly wrapped, included Apple certified, and in NEW condition.  There is no way I could tell it was not new or refurbished.  The price was the best I could find after researching other sellers.  I would highly recommend iPower Resale Inc to anyone looking for a MacPro.  Their customer service is exceptional.  Thank you for a great product!  5*****"
789,"When I looked at this product it only had one review and it was a bad one... I then checked all the other products the seller sold and the reviews were excellent, needless to say I took a chance and ordered this MacBook Pro 2019. It arrived before anticipated and it was securely package. I AM SO GLAD I took a chance on them because this MacBook is amazing! Now I’ve waited a couple months before reviewing it to make sure it works. The MacBook looks brand new, it didn’t have any dents or scratches. It works and performs like a new MacBook. I had to contact the seller over the a small issue with the charger and they went above and beyond to correct the issue.Excellent customer service excellent product. I recommend this seller to anyone!"
790,This is by far the best laptop ive ever owned! The laptop came with 0 scratches and only 16 battery charges on it. It even came with the apple box and stickers! Highly reccomend for the price. $850 is great for a 2019 macbook air.
791,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Everything I expected and more! Just like brand new!"
792,I love this laptop so so much. I think everyone should get it. The model is between 2018-2020 and the one I got had the Touch ID on it! Everything was very easy to set up and is in such great quality!
793,"Received in a timely manner.  Will review in a couple weeks.Well, it's been over 2 weeks since receiving my MacBook Air and I have to admit that it has proven to be worth it's price. The Retina display is phenomenal and it's compact chassis is just what I was looking for. I am not a power user, so I didn't need major memory capacity. The speakers are, surprisingly, crisp and clear for such a slim build. The fingerprint scanner is quick and a huge convenience. I am (or was) a long-time PC user and resisted getting an Apple, but the transition was smooth and Apple's claim to fame for being user-friendly and intuitive proved true. If you are looking for a compact, yet capable laptop with QWERTY keyboard, I would recommend this product."
794,"After having the laptop a few months, I can say my leap of faith to buy an amazon refurbished was worth it BUT I had to work a little bit.  It didn't arrive perfect and it still isn't perfect.  There is a tiny white dot on the screen where some pixels died (I guess) and when I first got it, I had to call Apple support to get iMessage and Facetime to work on it.  Then I had to take it to the Apple store to get the keyboard fixed as some keys would not work.  Thankfully, I had Apple Care on it so the cost to get it shipped off and fixed wasn't bad.  Overall, I am happy with my purchase and I recommend this seller, but I will probably buy new next time."
795,"** I have only had the laptop for a week, this review is only based off of the time I have had it**I was so nervous to buy a refurbished computer but this came like it was brand new. New packaging, new charger, spotless laptop. I was worried the battery would be bad and wouldn’t hold a charge. I was wrong. I downloaded over 12,000 photos and was on it nonstop for over 2 days without even having to charge it. I am in love with this!!!"
796,"As in the description exactly, thank the seller for the fast shipping and good packaging"
797,I love this laptop and I’m really happy with all the features. Would definitely recommend.
798,Exactly as expected. Great value.
799,"The product made a loud buzzing/grinding airplane-type noise as soon as it finished setting up which was truly deafening. I presume it was the fan producing this aggravating sound. No programs were running and the room was approximately 68 degrees Fahrenheit so overheating should not have been an issue. Since no computer should ever sound like a coffee maker at any time, I must conclude that it was defective. Return to sender."
800,Exceeded my expectations! Some of the reviews had me a bit nervous but I can’t tell you how happy I am! The laptop is on almost brand new condition! Only 1 TINY nick on the front (you can’t see it unless your looking) and it was perfectly ready for me to set up my account! No issues or problems! It comes in a box perfectly protected and has the charger to go with as well👍🏼 So happy with it! Thank you!
801,"I was so excited because this laptop came in perfect condition. But when I tried to change the unsername to my name it wouldn’t work. 3 calls to Apple later, and I find out this computer is owned by a school that can remotely access my laptop at any time. Meaning, if they wanted to they could shut down and erase my laptop. Amazon gave me a full refund but I am very sad and disappointed"
802,"All in all, the laptop works great! It runs fast, it’s clean, and it’s perfect for what I needed it. The one disappointment I have it they claimed this product as a catagory A which means like new. When it arrived, the screen had two scratch marks on it that was discolored from the rest of the screen. I would understand like new for any other part to have a scratch, but the screen is a big deal and it should have mentioned that in the details."
803,"This MacBook Air is amazing!  I had been previously using a 2007 MacBook Air and it was time to upgrade.  I have never purchased refurbished before so I really didn't know what to expect, though was greatly concerned.  Needless to say that this laptop heavily exceeded my expectations.  Other reviewers stated that their MacBook was not as described, though mine looks brand new.  The keys are still crisp and clean, the screen immaculate.  There are a few light scratches on the outside of the computer (mostly the underside), but it is very minimal and unnoticeable.It runs like a dream, though I have only begun using it.  I will update should the computer have any issues.  It is an early 2015 with 4 GB RAM and its OS is Sierra.  I wanted to share that, as I found the Q&A to be a little confusing on that point and other reviews didn't really mention it."
804,"When I received this package, I was thrilled...until I tried to turn it on and got a “low battery” notification...for 16+ hours. Turns out the cord provided (not a Mac product) is not the correct wattage to charge this device. It’s hard to tell at this point if the computer is faulty or not now that I’ve purchased a new cord from Best Buy, but it shuts down as soon as it’s disconnected from power. The screen is pretty floppy, too- falls back without provocation. All of which seem like things that should have been mentioned in the details before I decided to purchase.After taking this computer to the Apple store, I was informed that the issue was indeed the battery- completely bad and had to be replaced. Again, something that I wish I had known before purchasing. It is in working order now, but doesn’t meet my standards of what “certified refurbished” means, and product details lacking for sufficient purchasing knowledge ahead of time."
805,"It said I had to do an update. When I hit the only update allowed it said the latest version was already installed but it wouldn’t let me go foward.  Also the screen seemed loose.  So if it was cleared out they never installed the new software correctly. So it wouldn’t let me even get to the main screen.  Others had luck but I did not.Also when I plugged the power bar in. It had a bit of a shock come out. As an electrician, I know that was a big no no.  I was willing to spend the money and get the correct power cord. But with everything else. I thought that’s already 3 strikes. No thanks."
806,I was very hesitant buying a used MacBook from Amazon but it turned out great! Looks new and works amazingly. You will receive exactly what was described. I have no complaints!
807,"Good quality, arrived early. As-new condition. Easy to install from my old machine via time machine backup. The old one was a 2010, now we are good for another 5-7 years.Thanks"
808,I have been struggling with this product since day one. I am not getting responses from the seller OR the extended warranty repair company.I have never had trouble with Amazon before. Every issue I have ever had has been settled with ease and courtesy.This has not. Made more devastating as it it is the largest purchase I have had and the product has been unusable almost since day one. We sent it to the extended warranty place who said they fixed it but it still doesn’t work.We have spent hours at Apple doing diagnostics and it is simply not functional. To repair it would cost more than I paid. They do not think that the parts it was refurbished with are even Apple parts.This was a terrible product and not worth the money.
809,"I bought this Mac and it came with a non Apple charger, I bought this as travel computer, sure enough in the first week while I was in Europe I had to buy am authentic Apple charger at $117. Now a month  later my Mac has died. It was having issues as in when I tried to maximize the scene with Netflix it would just shrink to a 3x5"" screen volume,  also the screen had been replaced before I bought it and is not well attached, very disappointed, I bought this last summer, but only started to use it in October when I was traveling, so I spent close to $700 for a Mac that lasted 2 months, return and replacement window has ""closed"" so I am stuck with a hefty repair bill."
810,"Was very iffy about buying refurbished but it’s honestly like new! There are a couple of LITTLE scratches but nothing noticeable! Compared to my friends MacBook Air that she paid 1100$ for and they are the absolute same. Best $500 I’ve ever spent. & the company is AWESOME! The charger didn’t work as soon as I got it & I emailed them. Within an hour I had an email from them and they were sending me a new charger, thankful my friend had her charger that I used until I received mine but the battery last like 2-3 days so it wasn’t that bad."
811,"Seller: IT5050Wowie! My son wanted an Apple Computer for Christmas and I was not about to spend $1000+ on a laptop for a 11-year-old boy. But a refurbished MacBook was definitely priced more appropriate for him. This computer is AMAZING people!!! Looks so clean and new. Only a couple faint scratches on the bottom, the keyboard looks like it was hardly touched, screen is clear and no burn marks in it, plus the battery is great. The seller was so awesome to get me this gift in time for Christmas, they are quick to respond to emails and followed up to make sure it was delivered afterward. (seriously, the nicest people!) I had purchased another renewed MacBook from another seller, and their level of quality wasn’t as good, by far. I wish I could pre-select a quality grade for the laptop (excellent, good, fair, etc.), so it is a little scary just leaving it up to the unknown. I work in the retail business and I like to applaud small companies who sell quality products. Do yourself a favor and go here, they gave me a laptop that is stellar and eased my worries about a refurbished laptop. It really looks so good and is operating perfectly. This is such a smarter way to buy a computer, especially for kids, or if you like to have the pricier brands without spending the high price. – Happy Mommy!"
812,"Wow! Bought this from TECHarvard and was claimed to be Certified Refurbished, which according to the Amazon description should show limited to no signs of wear.  Well the device that I received not only was pretty scratched on the bottom, had a huge ding on the corner of the top cover, but the keyboard showed more signs of wear than the MacBook that I've had for 5 years(Space bar was completely warped).  Definitely does not resemble a new device in any way shape or form.  If they are selling used devices, call them used and mark the price down accordingly.  This is definitely going back."
813,"Overall the laptop is nice. A couple of marks on the outside but works relatively well. There was an issue with the battery that originally came with it. It would shut off around 65% battery life. I asked the seller for a replacement battery, which they gave to me free of charge. However, the replacement battery is not originally an Apple battery and instead a knock off. This issue prompted it to restart randomly no matter what the battery life was at. I’m putting the original battery back in and having Apple replace it with the appropriate battery for an additional fee. I got what a paid for and I won’t make the mistake of buying a refurbished Apple product from anywhere other than the Apple store again."
814,This is the BEST purchase I’ve ever made! The laptop 💻 arrived on time and in MINT condition. It functions beautifully and works flawlessly for my personal and business needs. I would recommend this seller to any & all I know who are in the market for reliable and affordable devices.
815,"Battery doesnt work! I travel to another country with the laptop and web I turned on and unplug it, it shuts down! And in Battery Options appears ""Replace now"". How you can help me? I'm in Ecuador now and wont be back in a year!"
816,"I love my new MacBook Air, it came as expected (relatively like new condition). This my first Mac and I’d purchase it again refurbished, you save greatly and get almost the same product 😀"
817,Bought certified refurbished ended up with a unit with a screen covered in dead pixels. I contacted apple to see how much a screen replacement should be more I'm looking a repair cost more than I paid for the laptop.
818,"DO NOT BUY!!! I purchased this computer for about two month and one day I couldn’t turn it on after it goes into sleep mode for a long time. It just wouldn’t turn no matter what I do, I tried every single method out there. I had to press the power button a hundred times for it to finally turn on. But after a while even that won’t work. The computer is just dead. I had to take it to the computer store and they told me it costs $434 to fix it!!!! Even though I actually paid to get it fixed I recommend everyone do not buy!! It’s not worth the money and will cost you more!! The guy in the computer store told me that there is corrosion inside the motherboard and in order to fix it it costs a lot of money ($434). I am truly upset and wished I would have just bought a brand new one from apple that’s the newest version and which will cost me less than what I spent on this computer!!"
819,"The laptop worked great the first week. Eventually, things started to decline and quickly.  I would constantly have to change the time clock, and that would prevent many apps from working properly or not at all. I also discovered that my webcam did not work. I asked customer service if I could get a replacement laptop, and they gave me a website to help me fix it myself. It did not work. Also, the computer would start dying very quickly, even after a full charge. I would also not start up automatically, even with the charger plugged in. I had to press to start button almost endlessly for it to just power on. Eventually, it just would not cut on at all, even with the charger plugged in. It’s completely dead. Apple says that it should cut on with the charger plugged in if it were a battery issue, so it’s definitely something wrong with it beyond that and it will cost upwards of $400 to fix. I’m totally bummed. It did not even last a year."
820,"BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY MOTHER, SHE IS 70 YEARS OLD AND BARELY USES THE LAPTOP.THE SCREEN IS IN THIS STATE, APPEARS TO BE PEELING! VERY BAD!!"

   Note: My purchase was completed through Kanga Supply for this item that ultimately doesn't function as intended.Amazon Renewed item descriptions indicate that the products should work and look like new, which wasn’t the case for this purchase, ergo my poor rating. After only having the Macbook for less than a day, I was forced to reach out to the seller because the product no longer functioned as intended.CONSThe Macbook worked fine for the first hour or so of use, but during an update, the screen flickered vigorously (see video). I hoped it was just a fluke, and it led me to believe there may be some software or hardware-related issue. After having the Macbook for less than 12 hours, I was forced to reach out to the seller because the screen flickering caused the laptop to become unusable (see picture). I also came here to draft a review in hopes that my issue is resolved quickly and effectively. I'll update my review once this is complete.PROSAfter removing the laptop and inspecting the outside, I was pleased. The outside of the Macbook is in good condition, just one or two visible scratches or marks.The charger was not the original Apple charger (as other reviews have indicated) but an OEM adapter. I don’t care that much about whether it’s an Apple charger, as long as it functions.Specs match the advertised item I purchased:128GB SSD8GB ramEDIT/UPDATE: After reaching out to the seller as instructed with the Amazon Renewed products, I never got a response in the allotted timeframe (2 business days) and was forced to reach out to Amazon directly. Ultimately, this item was returned for a refund.UPDATE 2: Today is 1/13/2020 and I have still yet to see this problem resolved to my satisfaction (refund or exchange of working product), after having ordered this product on 12/26/2019. Highly disappointed both in Amazon and the third-party seller.UPDATE 3: Received a replacement Macbook on 1/15/2020. So far it seems to be working, no issues with the screen per the previous item received (was NOT the same item sent back, verified by serial number). Pleased so far with this item."
822,"The 2015 Macbook Pro is still, in my opinion, the best Macbook even in 2019.  I use the SD card reader all the time and have several USB 3.0 devices.  I also use a newer 2017 quad-core i7 for work (no choice) but the difference in speed is not worth the added money and lacking ports.  When I actually put the newer 2017 to work, the heat issue is still a challenge for Apple and performance drops.  It's like having power that I can't actually use unless I sit in a walk-in freezer. Don't quote benchmark speed tests to me, what counts is actual performance sitting at my desk for hours at a time working on a project. I also prefer the magsafe power (although this one uses the magsafe II which I like less than magsafe I which had a more solid connection) This one, I purchased for my wife and it handles everything she needs it to do. Although you can't upgrade the memory on these models, so make sure you get enough for what you need.  If you want to change out memory, then the best choice is the Mid 2012 non-retina model which also come with DVD drives and has USB 3.0 ports."
823,"First off, I am removing a star because they shipped a counterfeit 60W Magsafe 2 charger with my order. I contacted them immediately and they offered to accept a return of everything. I explained that the charger was my only complaint and they overnight FedEx'd a genuine Apple replacement for free.""we sent you the wrong adapter for this batch of order and will overnight you the correct genuine one.""So they knowingly ship counterfeit chargers with some of their orders?The computer is pretty good cosmetically and operationally, but not as great as other reviewers. It is an Early-2015 12,1 model, this one was built in 12/2016. There is a crease over the right USB port from somebody yanking a USB plug. The battery has 107 cycles (89% life left). Keyboard and display are in great shape with no flaws. The SSD has no dead cells. It came with MacOS 10.13 installed.Overall its a good laptop and decent refurbishment job.EDIT: Knocking off another star. They sent me another counterfeit charger. Apple would never loosely jumble the cord in the box, a genuine power supply doesn't stay powered on for several seconds after it's unplugged from the main or stay lit green/orange after its unplugged from the laptop and this fake only puts out 25 watts max."
824,"I really feel like I got a great deal on this, mine arrived in brand new condition and it looked like it had never been used. I did see some people had bad experiences but mine was well worth the price tag. The only negative was that the charger provided is third party and not OEM Apple. The box is also generic and not Apple, not a big deal but you just don't get that same feeling opening it up as a new product. I will say that I checked the serial number on Apple and the computer itself was only a couple of years old, so in reality I paid around $450 for an Apple that was only a couple of years old with a decent amount of battery life still left. I only bought this as there was certain tasks that I could not do on my iPad and so I did not need a brand new super powerful computer. This one is great, does not get hot, fans are silent and the display looks incredible.Overall I was very happy with the purchase, it came fast and was like new condition at the fraction of the cost of a new one. I actually waited a few months before writing this review so that I could also include that I have had no issues at all in that time, battery lasts a decent amount of time and no software or hardware issues to report. It also runs the latest OS that I updated it to and I believe it will be supported software wise for some time to come. Completely worth the price!"
825,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   The Macbook came in working condition with all original components and an OEM charger but not with the extension cord. The major downfall is the condition of the laptop, for the above average asking price for this model I expected great condition as it is stated to be like new but instead the model I received was in okay condition (not cleaned either, large collection of gunk in hinge vent) at best with a lot of edge scratches and deep cuts throughout the chassis, and some unremovable stains from stickers! And worst of all the battery was at over 500 cylces, the battery life was 4-5 hrs max! thats horrible for whats suppose to be a renewed device! Not satisfied!EDIT:  Avoid this entire listing especially from the seller ''Easymobiledevices'', they ship dirty grade b laptop and have poor costumer service."
826,Once i started running it all sort of problems arises. First major problem is wifi drops off and will not let you connect to wifi. After this happens you cant even turn on/off the wifi. Used guest and still no wifi. Restarting or shutdown and restart will not activate wifi. If you restart it takes so long to reboot. Sometimes it get stuck on the waiting wheel on startup. One out of ten restart wifi will work for a minute but then drops off and you will no longer be able to connect again. I cant say anything physically because it looks fine. Lastly beware it shows and says freshly installed mojave os but it has instead sierra installed. The power cord looks like an imitation and not the original one because from the weight it is not the original one. I can tell because i have multiple macbook at home and that is not the original one. I am pretty disappointed with this seller.
827,"I’ll update 15 days from today.CONS:-Delivery packaging: it was a regular box with one thick bubble wrap to protect the laptop.First glance, the charger seems pretty beat up but seems to work fine.-The outer top of the laptop has a lot of scuff marks and scratches. Sides do as well. Nothing TOO severe.-Bottom have some scratches and wearing on the rubber, not too noticeable.PROS:-Had a full battery-Set up went smoothly with no hiccups.-Outer signature glowing Apple works well.-Opening the laptop, the screen has no visible scratches, cracks, or scuffs at all.-Keyboard has no loose keys and is glowing well.-Trackpad has no scratches and works really well no weird working sides SO FAR.-Software automatically updated to Catalina, kinda wanna wait to update to Big Sur.I’ll update March 13, 2021"
828,"Still a GREAT LAPTOP, arguably the best MacBook Pro 13” ever made, 2 or 3 iterations later! I have had mine for 3 months now and although I was a little disappointed that I got a no-brand MagSafe power brick instead of an Apple brand, it’s caused no problems for me. I have been using Logic Pro X a lot and it runs nice and smooth even with the haphazard way I use it, leaving muted unused tracks all over the place as I learn about things like track bouncing and experiment with every single effect and different audio formats (I feel bad sometimes like I am unnecessarily abusing the laptop, lol) and I haven’t frozen or crashed at all. I have used a few emulation programs for old Saturn, Super Famicom, PS and Dreemcast games that push the 2D sprite and parallax scrolling envelope and again I haven’t had any problems. Only thing I have experienced that has been an issue is the actual Mac OS and it’s limitations with regard to formats, programs that it supports and connectivity with outside developers but I have also been able to get around that by setting Virtual Machines up and GUID partitioning to use whatever other OS I need. This is also not a complaint about the hardware itself but rather the Mac OS software so should not be considered when it comes to the actual MacBook Pro 13”.You will want to upgrade to an NVME M2 SSD at least 256 GB or 512 GB right away, as the 128 GB SSD will fill up within 2-3 months of moderate use and the newer M2s will increase the OS loading speed more than anything else. Luckily you have your pick of great SSDs like the Samsung 970 Evo, etc that you can easily swap in with a $5 adapter, a screwdriver and no soldering (just search YouTube for “MB Pro 13 2015 SSD upgrade”)…The unique things and PROS about this MB Pro 13” are the older style KEYBOARD that doesn’t break like 2016-later model keyboards do, 2 USB 3 ports, an SD CARD R/W and a FULL SIZE HDMI PORT all built in. This is the last MB Pro 13 with any of those ports on board and the fact that you can swap SSD hard drives with no soldering and very little skill needed, all-in with the M2 you get a sexy little powerhouse for half the price of the newer model Pro 13”s (1/4 price of current gen)! The rest (CPU, onboard graphics, sound/speakers) make this laptop a must have that will likely only appreciate in value $$$!Two Thunderbolt 2/miniDisplayPorts are useful if you want to setup 2-3 Screens, but the CONS Are that you get NO ThunderBolt 3/USB-C ports and more and more adapters and devices require that connection these days, though with the USB 3 ports there are ways around it, complicated as they may be. You also CANNOT UPGRADE RAM unless you know how to de-solder the current ram and solder up new ram (accepts up to 16GB DDR-3 in 2X8GB formation) and setup the machine to accept the new ram, which seems a recipe to completely destroy the board/laptop without at least some Mac building & Mac hardware programming know-how, possibly even special equipment.MAKE SURE YOU GET THE MODEL WITH THE AMOUNT OF RAM YOU NEED BUILT IN & a CPU that will be sufficient for you and you won’t be disappointed with this awesome little 6 year old laptop! Don’t get the 4 GB model even if it will “work” for you “short-term”! I got the 8GB/i5 2.9Ghz/128GB and I already regret not paying another $100 for the 16GB ram model, but c’est la vie.Just buy this MacBook Pro 13” while you can, replace the SSD as soon as possible, enjoy it, keep it another 5-10 years and you will likely be able to triple your investment by reselling it assuming Apple stays on their current trajectory with their MB Pro Hardware releases!!!"
829,"Hi, I bought this Macbook Pro 13"" early 2015 and received last week on Aug 23th. The laptop has a good appearance and doesn't have any flaws. However, the charger(45w) packed together with the macbook is not for macbook pro but for  Macbook Air. I just found out today, cuz when I use the charger(45w) laptop cpu temperatures goes up to 65-85 celcius. and I can't use more than 4 hours. But when I charge my macbook with Macsafe 1 (85w, which is for Pro), the cpu temperature keeps 40-50 degree, and it runs around 10hours. I want to change my charger into “MacBook Pro Charger 85w”. Thank you."
830,I'm very dissatisfied with this purchase.I can't use the Mac because the hard drive was not reset and the software on the Mac dose not allow you to use it.Also there was no charger.Again very disappointed.
831,"Looks brand new, wrapped and sealed in Apple packaging. Plugged it in and turned it on and let it go. Absolutely no problems, it was automatic and wonderful to have the computer set itself up. Has performed flawlessly as expected of an Apple laptop."
832,"The laptop arrived in fair condition.  The screws show signs of wear so it may have been opened up during the ""renewal"" process.  Old stickers were left on the bottom. Also, the laptop was shipped with a cheap knockoff Chinese charger.  I have no reason to trust this charger so I'll have to order a genuine Apple one instead.Fortunately I don't need this machine to be a workhorse or I would send it back.  This should survive a year at least but I don't trust it as-is - I will wipe the hard disk, NVRAM, and SMC just to be safe."
833,Product was faulty. The charging port wouldn't hold the plug. I returned it. I don't think the refurbishing process is very competent.
834,"This is exactly like the MacBook I was given for work that was stolen on a plane flight. No problems with this as a replacement so far, smooth sailing for 3 months already! I got the protection plan just in case, but I'm very satisfied with this cheaper than new replacement. Will update if there are any issues that arise. Would recommend."
835,"Idk what I was thinking not having an apple in the first place. This laptop is very easy to use, fast, and I’m excited to see how productive I can be with this format. I feel free, nothing holding me back now!! Unlike old pc with unresponsive interface, slow speeds, and constant crashes, this one gives me no problems!!"
836,This laptop was literally like brand new out of the box. So far my daughter is so thrilled with her graduation gift. She is ready for college now!!!
837,"Our first ever Mac but so far its been quite impressive. It was easy to setup and get it going. It works well and very easy to use, turn on/off, carry around and day to day life. Wish the battery would last a bit longer."
838,"BUYER BEWARE!I knew by choosing a refurbished computer, I was taking a risk, but I never expected this. When I received this MacBook Air, I was surprised it was the model Apple stopped making in 2017, since the title said “Newest Version.” I emailed the seller and they said Amazon forced that in the title and told me I could return it. I work full time, am in grad school, and have three kids. I figured with it being an Apple it would last long enough to get me through school, so I kept it. Now, six months later the screen won’t turn on. It’s completely black.I am able to connect to an external monitor and use the computer that way, so I know it’s the display. After trying to adjust the brightness, several resets, resetting the SMC and the PRAM, I called Apple Support. They ruled out all software issues and told me it had to be the hardware.At this point I contacted the seller and they basically told me “sorry, it’s outside of the 90 day window so there’s nothing we will do for you.” I have escalated to Amazon trying to get some kind of resolution. They just confirmed there is nothing they are willing to do for me. They also are not doing anything to penalize the seller, All Out Apple. I'm shocked at Amazon. Shady sellers like All Out Apple will always be around, but I really thought Amazon was better than Ebay in that way. Lesson Learned.There is no reason a MacBook Air should have a display of a completely stops functioning after six months of use, even refurbished. I’m grateful that I had a work-provided monitor I can plug into to do my schoolwork, but if I was aiming to be tethered to my desk, I would have bought a Mac Mini."
839,"Got the computer two days early! this was probably the fastest delivery I've ever received from amazon. I wasn't going to buy refurbished but I really wanted another MacBook and shelling out $2k for a new one was simply out of the question. When I saw the price for this MacBook Air, I decided to roll the dice and buy it. I knew it could possibly come not as advertised, such as having scratches or not being updated as far as software is concerned but when I opened it up it was practically BRAND NEW! set up was simple as can be! only took me 5 minutes to sign in with my Apple ID and all my information was synced between my iPhone and iPad and onto the MacBook Air. There were a few minor scratches less than a couple centimeters on the bottom of the computer nothing that noticeable. the charger doesn't stick as well as I'd like and one of the hinges is half broken off but I've that same issue with practically every MacBook I've ever had. I was really surprised with the quality. it said 2017 version but with all the updates and new iterations its hard to gauge which MacBook your getting I thought I was purchasing a much older MacBook Air than what I got this thing is amazing and the 13 in screen is far larger than I expected it to be feels like a 15 or 17 in display when having it in your hands/ the computer itself is incredibly light, the main reason I chose the air you can carry it in anywhere with one hand and hardly feel it definitely much lighter than my 2020 iPad 11"" All in all if you're on a budget, this computer is the way to go! for $400 its practically brand new and runs like a dream! thanks amazon for this incredible refurbished Mac! love it !"
840,"I don’t what to think I bought 2017 16gb 256 ssd but I received a refurbished 2019 8g 256 perfectly packaged, I can’t put apple care I already call for that but im not sure to keep it because I want a computer of 16of ram but this one is 2019, im gonna give the chance to see how it works, And it cost me the same price of a refurbished 2019 Of apple but those ones you can put apple care"
841,"hola, soy de peru. Estoy contento con la compra, la compre por el precio, y me llego tal cual las especificaciones.(late2018,2.3gz,8ram,256ssd). la bateria llego con 350 ciclos aproxen cuanto a lo estetico, tenia pequeños arañones en un costado, pero nada grave, la pantalla intacta y el touchbar ok. el cargador sellado oem.califico la compra como 9/10."
842,Got a few months out of this before the screen started disappearing intermittently. Then it wasn't so intermittent. I'd have much rather spent the extra money to get a new computer that didn't break than to buy something second-hand and have to decide to repair or replace.
843,"Considering I was 100% ripped off, I would not recommend you purchase from this seller, I did not receive what I wanted, the serial number for a COMPUTER comes up as an iPhone 11... Just.. No."
844,This computer was working fine and all of a sudden the screen went out.  Cost me $640 to fix it.
845,"Delivery was super fast, considering I’m in South Africa. The laptop is simply beautiful, woks well, no complaints, I love it."
846,"Positivo, EXCELENTE EQUIPO!!!"
847,So far this was a steal. Great product for a great value.
848,super machine
849,The space key and some of the keys were not working As they are supposed to. Really sticky
850,"Arrived, boxed well with balloon cushions. Power adapter looked clean but had scratches. Opened up the Lid of the MacBookPro and it looked like it had some sort of disease or cancer & it smelled quite strange too. It had over 50% battery so I carried on with a reset which resulted in an error. Luckily it booted back into Yosemite OS that it had installed years ago, after 3 failed attempts managed to update to Mojave. Of course first things first copy music etc onto, USB stick struggled to go in either of the USB Ports (look at the photos) was also stuck after insertion but managed to pull out, with a hard pull - full force - anger. Had a look into the ports and discovered they were literally rusted dirty like disgusting, this is not the definition of Refurbished - but 2nd Hand or Heavily Used. Be aware, set your expectations right in oder to avoid any disappointments."
851,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I was super stoked upon arrival, began setting up the laptop and within minutes the screen stopped working. Literally pixels. Severely disappointed. I have gotten ahold of kanga and they are working to replace the device but it has now been over a week since I’ve purchased the unit with two day shipping and still have nothing to show for it. I hope they come through on their end and send me a functional unit."
852,"I've only had it for about a week now and this 2015 MacBook Pro is working phenomenally! I was kinda hesitant buying a refurbished MacBook from Amazon, but I can honestly say I'm go glad I went ahead and did. It came extremely fast and right from opening the box, it was as if I had bought a brand new one right from Apple themselves. There's not a scratch, dent, stain, dust or anything on it. So far it's working extremely well and I will definitely buy form this seller in the future and recommend them to others as well! Great price for a great computer."
853,"I’ve had this MacBook Pro going on 4 days and so far so good! It has met all my expectations and more. I grew up using windows PCs. This is my first Apple computer and I’m happy to have made the transition. Wish I did this long time ago but better late then never. If it wasn’t for the packaging and not being in the original box, I probably wouldn’t be able to tell this was refurbished. This is just based from my experience using MacBooks at the Apple store. Also, there was a few minor scratches on the bottom of the laptop.I will revise and change review in a month if any problems. But as of now, my review above is how I feel."
854,"I've only had it for a couple days, but so far this is a great purchase. The thing looks brand new, and I know it isn't. I am replacing an older Mac and just can't afford the prices of new machines from Apple. Using Migration Assistant (an app that comes with Macs) I was able to restore a time machine backup from the old machine, so I've lost nothing in the transition."
855,"When I ordered this product for the first time, it came with a green line on the screen. I contacted the costumer service, they responded very quickly and replaced it.The second computer came with better specs, I was the happiest person... for 2 months though, the computer suddenly stop responding.Other things that are worth saying:- The charger is generic. A generic charger can easily damage the battery of the computer, that could explain my problem.- The second computer they sent, had a sticker that covered the whole low part of the computer (those stickers that are the same color as the computer and are used to cover up very big scratches.Conclusion: they can deliver a great costumer service, but not a working product."
856,"The macbook pro only worked for a short while. It had a charging/powering problem - wouldn't keep a charge at first, then wouldn't power on even when plugged in. Confirmed it was not a charger issue.I contacted the company who said to send it back for repair. Once they received it they wrote saying it cannot be fixed and charged me a ""restocking fee"" in the amount of the purchase of the laptop. Outrageous!! I even had a protection plan for it. After numerous interactions they refused to help and returned the laptop without telling me. THEN they said they couldn't do anything in terms of a refund because I had the machine. Months later they refuse to resolve it and amazon can't help me because it's a third party seller. An ABSOLUTE JOKE of a company. I'm out over $500.00 with a computer that can't be fixed - and Apple store said they could try but for more than the computer's worth. So yeah. They have my money and I have nothing.DO NOT BUY from these people if you'd like to keep your money."
857,"Hey all! So I’ve gotten into photography lately and needed a upgrade from my old 2012 MacBook Pro and 2011 Asus laptops for editing. Figured a 2015 model would be the way to go for a decent upgrade without spending tons of money. I was super skeptical about buying a reconditioned one through Amazon after reading the reviews and thought about it for about 4 hours before I made the transaction. Next day it was at my door step with me a bit nervous about opening the package and seeing a beat up MacBook, I opened the box and the MacBook was in a bubble wrapped sleeve and that’s it. Okay I’m fine with that but what was the condition of it? Looks like it barely got used or the previous owner always had a case on it. Outside from a few nicks here and there it’s flawless. Turns on and is super quick, the Retina display is beautiful and definitely enjoyable to watch movies. It came with Mojave so the first thing I did was update it to Big Sur and it’s still flawless. I’ve only had it for a day if that but so far I’m happy with my purchase. Just be mindful yours may or may not be like mine condition wise I got lucky. Should you buy one of these? I would I’m pleased with my purchase and I’m sure you would be too. But I’ll update with any issues if they come up in the future. Thankfully I’m a bit tech savvy so whatever happens I’m sure I can fix it."
858,"This of course this is an old model and reconditioned/renewed, so I was expecting it to look somewhat used; however, this MacBook Pro is in PERFECT CONDITION as if I had purchased it new. I'm upgrading from a very heavy and slow 2009 white MacBook that's a dinosaur and I could only do very basic things on it. It has almost zero capability in terms of battery life (it could only be used plugged in) so this laptop is an absolute gem in comparison. This might be why I'm so hyped and elated. Plus the price was very good. *I hope the computer doesn't have some sudden glitch and dies on me...lol!Now, I can finally edit my videos in iMovie, which was not working on the old MacBook, because I couldn't update it anymore. I need this laptop mainly for traveling, to do editing work, I have a 2 monitor PC set-up at home. My only wish is that I could transfer my Adobe CS to the new laptop.SIDE NOTE: it's actually overall a little smaller than my old 13"" (screen size is the same), it's not as heavy, but not as light as the Air; it arrived with Catalina iOS installed and I had to upgrade to Monterey to use the newest version of iMovie - this isn't a complaint, just an observation."
859,"I bought for my mom, great deal (sort-of), works great (after I deleted 2 mysterious old unknown wifi connections)I bought this for my mom, she was always having Windows problems, viruses disguised as virus removal, scammy pop-ups, and so on.  Happy day!  :DThey raised prices during Prime Day, wth?  I thought I was getting a good deal, but afterward I noticed the price went down.  Anyway, I ordered this for my mom.  She's been using Windows and I wanted her to experience a Macbook Pro.  This one is actually even better than mine!  I'm still happily using a Late 2013 2.4 Ghz 8 RAM 256 GB 13-inch Retina, her's is exactly the same except it's a Early 2015 and it's actually got 2.7 Ghz!  Anyway she seems really happy with it.  I set it up for her, and ran the serial number, which was not found, not surprisingly although I'm not sure what that means, and the update page in the App Store looks like it was coded in 1995, so I'm not sure what's up with that.  Could be something funky going on, but all I know is it works and we're happy with it.  She's getting used to using it, and she says it's fast and smooth.  She was getting tired of all the Windows updates and virus stuff and all the spammy popups telling her to purchase a virus disguised as virus removal, yadda yadda yadda, so I am well-pleased that she is now almost a full-blown Mac-head.  Thanks Apple.  I hope to be able to afford an Apple car when they do come out, haha.  I'm not sure about the battery-life yet, but I HAD TO replace the battery on mine, so replacing it on hers should not be a problem."
860,It’s just one continuous problem after the other with this computer. It’s really not worth it to save a little bit of money just buy new not refurbished have your warrantee you’re better off in the long run.
861,For this being my first ever Mac- This was an amazing buy... no scratches or dents. Its basically BRAND NEW. 😝😝😝The only thing is that it says 512gb but the space says 256gb so be wary of that.But other than that I am really happy with my purchase.
862,Good
863,Love it
864,"the product arrived with the screen broken. I would like a refund of $ 400 to repair it, since he is now in Brazil."
865,So happy with this purchase. Even my kids said it looks like the new ones. Has some minor imperfections but at the cost totally acceptable. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.
866,"I purchased through amazon this m1 chip 512 gb 8ram macbook pro 2020 year manufacture.  I’m a mac user of many years.  The computer is blazing fast, slim, light with great battery life. A huge bonus—-little need for additional  anti virus add on software since the macbook anti virus platform is very solid. A hidden gem when you buy any apple device is phenomenal tech telephone support.  The advisors at the apple stores and by telephone are the best part of the apple experience for me and even rival the devices they sell. Yes, I hate the high prices and know the game but over time I’ve  accepted their price points because of the incredible tech support."
867,battery would not take any charge  stuck at 1%
868,"I cannot believe the condition my Macbook is in, you can’t even tell if it’s used and the packaging was very nice and professional with the white box and wrapped just like it is when you get it directly from Apple. I am super happy with my purchase, thanks Amazon."
869,"Good, but it is a little small.. easy to control. Recommend if you are hard to control your computer"
870,Computer will not charge.
871,"""Refurbished"" even though Battery life was non existent from the startup, always check the reviews on laptops to make sure they have over 200, cause then you won't be played by greedy ass people like I was"
872,"Minor scratches , for the price reduction is a great buy !!!"
873,Light weight
874,"El producto reacibdiocionado en muy buen estado, funciona perfectamente y venía totalmente protegido y embalado. Muy satisfecho con la compra"
875,"Looks and acts brand new. Everything exactly as advertised. Will update if I have any issues but after a week I can say, I am pleasantly surprised!"
876,"If you've been waiting for Apple to wake up and address the concerns raised by the Apple community -- your wait is now over. This is the MacBook Pro we've all been wanting for years. This review is for the higher end model, stock.The good.- Keyboard. It's fantastic. The key travel has been extended to 1mm, which is about half of the original keyboard found on the 2015 and prior model years. It feels just as good to type on because apple improved the tactile feedback. The keys sort of spring back. The keyboard is quiet and very comfortable to type on. The keys are slightly smaller but do not make typing on them any more difficult. The directional arrows are now properly setup and the physical Esc key is back, making it a breeze to flip through open applications.- Screen. The difference in size is subtle but noticeable. It's technically even more dense, but just barely. You won't notice much difference from recent MacBook Pros but true to Apple, the display is absolutely gorgeous. The 0.6 inch difference in size retains the same logical resolution, so everything should look just slightly bigger which I welcome.- Processor. The base model has the same chipset as the 2019 15.4"" model. The performance, however, is about 10% better due to significantly improved airflow and larger heatsinks. The issue of heat related throttling has been largely addressed. On the upper model, the machine now comes with 8 cores and serious performance bump. There is literally nothing you can throw at this MacBook that it won't handle with breeze.- Graphics. The traditional setup is still here. You have the onboard Intel chipset, which operates when the demand for visual performance is low. You also have a discrete AMD chip which delivers significant improvement over the previous generation. In fact, the base model delivers performance in excess of the upper spec Vega chipset from last year. The leap is extraordinary. As before, the system will automatically choose which graphics card to use depending on demand.- Sound. In one world, amazing. Imagine Apple took a HomePod and flattened it to fit it in the housing of the MacBook Pro. That is essentially the experience. Bass is pronounced and crisp and treble is sharp. The sound is rich and room-filling. There are six speakers instead of two in the last generation.-Microphone. Major improvements with three mics instead of one in the previous generation. I use the MacBook to make calls using an iPhone and the sound on the other end is clear and free from background noice. I've been told it sounds a lot better than before, but that is of course subjective. On paper, you're getting better noise reduction and improved sound fidelity.- Touch Bar. Controversial in the past, I think it may now be the ""happy medium"" between physical keys and the useful Touch Bar which adapts to the content on the screen. The Esc key is back and on the right hand side you'll find Touch ID and power button.- SSD. You'll love the fact that now base starting size of the SSD has been doubled on both the entry model and the upper model with 512GB and 1TB respectively.- Gaming. This has to be mentioned. The graphics card offers incredible leap in performance. Modern games that would get 14-16FPS on high setting now perform at 35-40FPS with ease. Same settings. Same games. Huge improvement. It's now possible to play AAA games on the MacBook Pro with reasonable performance and high visual settings.- Productivity. This machine is a beast. I use the full Affinity suite and do some limited video editing. In addition, I have multiple productivity programs open, over a dozen Safari tabs, two email clients, and dozens of other apps, such as CRM, task managers, notes, etc. Everything runs smoothly.- Value. Yes, value. This expensive laptop brings the best value in the lineup of the 15.""4 (now 16"") offering to date. If you carefully look at the costs of truly compatible Windows offerings, you'll find the MacBook Pro to be competitively priced.The Bad- Weight. The machine is slightly heavier but I welcome the added bulky. Finally Apple went with functionality over its obsession with thiner and lighter hardware, giving us a machine with proper thermal management, proper keyboard and more. But if you plan on taking it with you places, you'll feel the extra bulk.- BTO Updates. The cost of BTO options is still quite high, with the noted exception of the 8GB option on the GPU. You're still paying a significant premium for each incremental upgrade over the base model.To sum up -- This is the best MacBook Pro in many years. It's a well-rounded, powerful machine that brings about incredible performance and value. I would highly recommend it to any Pro.If you're upgrading from the 13"" model and wonder how much more real estate you can expect, see attached side-by-side comparison photo.Update 3/15/20 -- Absolutely a beast of a machine. I love it. It has been pretty much perfect and its performance continues to surprise me. I have the top-speced model and it smokes pretty much everything I've used to date. In fact, it will perform on par with the new Mac Pro base configuration. Don't believe me? Google it. This is by far the best MacBook Pro to date and an amazing value. Well worth the price of admission if you need it."
877,"The performance differences between it and it's predecessor are marginal, at best ...Yet you are being asked to pay $2400 for membership. Think back to around 2015, when the previous gen entry cost was still $ 2000, then they changed it to $2400. For that, you got shafted with a crap keyboard, a failing display, an identity crisis for a touch-bar, and less connectivity.Now that this latest model came out and people are buying it, they are bolstering Apple's position: never apologize for hardware issues, make ppl pay extra for AppleCare+, give folks a real working keyboard and make it look like they are doing you a favor so the prices are .... what .... justified ?Apple's pricing schemes make you wonder if they think they can get ppl to believe that hardware is actually comparable to a commodity, or something like that.Lastly, you do not know what kind of quality issues lurk behind these new models ...."
878,"So disappointed.....As soon as I added Lightroom and started process photos, the laptop began to ""click"" during the processing phase! Obviously this isn't normal; currently in the process of returning :("
879,"Maybe I just got unlucky, but the laptop I received never really worked.  When going through the setup process, the computer was unable to load data from my Time Machine backup.  I cancelled out of it in an attempt to complete the rest of the installation process.  I had to shutdown and after that,  the machine never worked again.  During the boot phase it just cycled through the Apple logo/progress bar startup over and over and over again.  It would almost reach the end and then stop and restart, but never fully booted.  I returned it, but since it was processed through a third party, I had to pay a 15% restocking fee, so I only received 85% of what I initially paid.  So I had to pay almost $400 for the pleasure of owning a broken Mac for a day.  What a joy!  I complained to the 3rd party and they said the laptop was fine which is baffling since I watched the machine try and boot for half and hour.  I feel screwed.  Maybe I just got a bad product, or maybe Apple has serious quality control issues.  It's seriously making me think of giving up on Macs all together."
880,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   its hardly been a week i bought the MacBook Pro 16"".and i am already facing trouble.whenever i play a video there is a green screen flash coming.i have no clue whats going on.i did not even install any major applications on the laptop too.This is ridiculous."
881,Battery life is supposed to run up to 11 hours yet mine dies at around 1-2. I've been on it right now for about 20 minutes and the battery has dropped about 15%. My laptop also begins to get really hot after using it for a while and I can hear the fans running at their maximum. I'm not sure what the issue is since the sellers are selling authentic apple products. I will be returning and just purchasing from apple.
882,"I have owned the 15.4 Touch Bar model since 2016, I typed on it before I bought it and I knew the keyboard wasn't as good as my 2012 15"", but, it wasn't as bad as some reviewers made it out to be, I'm glad I bought it before the bad reviews. The 2016 was a huge upgrade from the 2012 and I can say the 2019 is a huge upgrade from the 2016.There is no one feature that is absolutely night and day from the 2016, but, every function is better.  Screen quality and size, performance, keyboard (mostly non-touchbar ESC key for me), battery life, speakers, mic and thermal, it's a bit quieter than the 2016. If you have been holding out because you like the 2012 keyboard travel and feel, the 2019 travels further and feels better.I can't personally feel the weight difference in my bag, between laptop, accessories (Jabra speaker being the heaviest) my bag weighs about 9lbs so if it's 9.3lbs I can't feel it and once it's out of the bad I don't tend to move it around. It is a big larger, but, still fits in my small 2 pocket Tumi laptop bag, so the .25"" doesn't bother me either.I'm looking forward to seeing if it's as durable, I got over 300 full battery cycles on the 2016, I expect the same from this unit, but, only time will tell.Hope my experience helps."
883,"Yes, this  gorgeous machine that's fits my needs exactly DID drop dead just now, after running well for weeks. I've read that Apple installs a ""drop dead"" chip in its machines, but I never thought they got the timing as precise as this. Well done, Apple.But now I'm out my 2000 bucks (PLUS) and I have a dead box sitting on my work desk. This is not good, not even for a laugh.I CANNOT contact the seller either. Maybe they all died from the virus, or SOME virus. PLEASE, good folks at Apple and Amazon,  help me!Thank y'all."
884,"OMG!!! This is my 3rd MacBook Pro that I have owned over the past few years, and I have to say this one is by far the best one yet. This is my first Space gray, and I it's absolutely gorgeous and sleek. A very sexy machine. It looks so much better than the silver. A more modern look.The screen is freaking GORGEOUS! The colors, the brightness, so pure and crystal clear. And me being an animator, graphics designer and writer, I can tell the larger screen for sure.My last MacBook Pro was the 15 inch 2015, and I thought I was going to miss the glowing Apple logo, but to be honest, I don't. When I go back on my 2015, it seems so outdated. The mirrored logo looks so much more modern.The trackpad is HUGE, and I love it. My 2015 track pad seems so tiny and disappointing now.I have no idea why so many people say they hate the Touch Bar. I LOVE IT! I can not imagine life without it. It's beautiful and as a writer I love how it recommended the corrected words. I love being able to run through videos, play music and navigate more effectively. It's perfect. Well....almost. The only complaint I would say is it goes dim in dim light. I thing it should be our decision to dim it. Other than that it's perfect. I also love how easy it is to get to the emojis. 😊The Keyboard....OMG! I love it. It's so much better than the 2015. I can type so fast on this thing. It's AMAZING. I also love the backlight. It's so bright in a dark room and it doesn't bleed out like the 2015.And lastly. I LOVE how powerful this beautiful beast is. I can created my animations with no struggle. And it renders at lightening speed which means my fans of my Youtube Channel will get faster animated horror stories from me.If you are caught on the fence if you should buy it. Get off that fence right now, and BUY IT! IT'S 100% PURE PERFECTION!!!! Thank you so much, Apple. Windows users are soooo missing out!👍"
885,Fantastic
886,"This is an unusually large advance over previous models, especially in raw computing power, but also in fun things like screen and headphone support.This Amazon listing has two different processors, the M1 Pro (listed as 16-Core GPU ""style"") and the M1 Max (32-Core GPU). I'll call one the Pro, the other the Max. I got the base Pro, but much of what I'll say applies to both, and I'll have some comments specifically about the Max too. (MBP below = MacBook Pro.)Amazon doesn't offer most of the options you can get, only the ones listed. For now (and probably later), that's the Pro with 16GB RAM and 512GB or 1TB SSD, or the Max with 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD. 3 versions total.Screen Brightness* and HappinessThis screen can get up to 1600 nits brightness and can sustain full-screen brightness up to 1000. That's very impressive, as MBPs since 2016 have topped out at 500.*But the vast majority of the time, this screen will also top out at 500, because those other numbers are only for HDR (high dynamic range, what Apple calls XDR), i.e. some videos and some photos viewed in some programs. If you're browsing the internet, using productivity apps, or the like, those are almost all SDR (standard dynamic range). You'll be seeing them at the same brightness as with MBPs for the last five years.That said, the new screen is beautiful and bright in both HDR and SDR for most situations. For HDR, it puts out more color and brightness, and darker blacks - a million-to-one contrast ratio - with a wider range of light and color that has more pop and more detail in shadows and highlights. It can be dazzling or just more realistic.For SDR, it's much like before, still a gorgeous screen, with better contrast than before because of darker blacks.Has more pixels per inch (254, up from 226), and more pixels all over (3456 by 2234, up from 3072 by 1920). The aspect ratio remains 16:10 (not counting the top menu bar).ProMotionProMotion is Apple's name for screen refresh rates that can go up to 120Hz, or lower to save processor/battery power when 120 isn't needed. This makes motion smoother, more natural.For now where ProMotion applies is limited. Most scrolling in browsing, including with Safari, still tops out at 60Hz. Which is fine for me, but it bothers some people, looks choppy to them. This could be changed with a software update.Bloom and GhostsBloom is when a bright spot on a dark background bleeds out past where it's supposed to be, a common issue with this kind of screen. I and most others think this screen handles it well (better than the iPad Pro), but it can still arise some.Ghosting is when a moving object leaves a noticeable trail of ghost images behind for a fraction of a second, one for each new frame until the old image fades. MBPs are notoriously mediocre at this kind of ghostbusting, and this screen is no exception. Expect the usual haunting, if you notice that kind of thing.PWMFor those concerned (you mostly know who you are), there is PWM (pulse-width modulation) on the smaller 14"" version of this screen, and so very likely on this one too, at a frequency of 14,880Hz at all brightness levels (measured by NotebookCheck). That's a very high frequency, considered well beyond what would cause trouble for the susceptible.The NotchAs you can see in the main photo here, there's a black Notch at the top of the screen. There are no pixels there. The long-desired improved camera is there, and a mic array and light sensor (and maybe room for a Face ID system if they decide to make MBPs with that). As with the iPhone Notch, it's controversial.You can make the Notch disappear, or rather blend in, if you make the background up there black. It also disappears into the black bars when you view things like videos in full-screen mode.The cursor disappears into the Notch if you put it there. If an app has menu items that stretch there, they disappear too, but they'll still function normally if you put the (invisible) cursor on them.Desperate times call for desperate measures. Most apps won't have this trouble, but if you must, you can avoid menu items disappearing by using the ""Scale to fit"" function, which shrinks the entire screen work area a little to fit below the Notch. Makes it look like an old 15"" if the background is black, like there are wide black bezels. (Google ""Scale to fit below built-in camera"" for full instructions and mockery.)There are also third-party apps, such as Bartender, to manage how items appear in the menu bar and keep them visible.Camera and MicsThe new camera that, along with the thinner bezels, makes the Notch necessary, is 1080p, with an f/2 lens for good exposure in the shadows. Video looks noticeably better than before, though it can have a processed look.The three mics sound very clean and natural but with a little less bass than before to my ears, which is fine.Extra ScreensYou can use two external monitors with the Pro, down from four with previous models. They can be up to 6K @60Hz with a billion colors. The Max can still use four: three 6K and one 4K, all @60Hz etc.You can use 4K @120/144Hz HDR monitors too.You can run two from one port if you use the right kind of dock or daisy-chain.Headphone OomphThe new headphone jack has more power for high-impedance headphones. It automatically adjusts, so it won't overwhelm low-impedance phones. If the headphones have less than 150 ohms impedance, they get 1.25 volts RMS. If more, 3 volts. That might cause it to fail to provide enough power to some not-so-high-impedance headphones that still require extra power, such as planars.With my 2016 15"" MBP, I've had to use a portable amp for my Beyerdynamic DT 1990 Pros (250 ohm), but now I can pretty well do without it, though sometimes only just. The volume on some sources is still not always what I wish I could make it. But now I can nearly achieve hearing loss with the intro to the guitar riff in ""Money for Nothing."" Which also sounds good, and healthier, a couple notches down.Among other headphones that have tested favorably with the new jack are the DT 990 Pros (250 ohm), and the Sennheiser HD650, 660S, 6XX, and HD800 (150 to 300 ohm).One report says the planar Hifiman HE4XXs (35 ohm planar) sound good, but most planars tested are said to need more power. The Audeze LCD-2Cs are reported to sound good enough, though not their best. The LCD-3s and Hifiman Sundaras and Aryas are said to be underpowered.For my usual regular-impedance phones, Cleer Flow IIs (16 ohm), the wired volume is a little louder than before, though still not always the earsplitting barrage I want for some sources. Maybe for the best.Quality iems (in-ear monitors) that require especially clean input, but not too much, reportedly sound good, including Andromedas and Moondrop Starfields.SpeakersThey're improved from the already laptop-leading speakers from earlier MBPs, with a fuller sound and decent kick, amazingly good for when nothing with a 3"" woofer is around.Apple mysteriously says the 14"" M1 has the same speaker system, but looking inside both machines shows the speakers in the 16"" are bigger - both ""subs"" and tweeters - and located differently, with the subs in the front corners on this one. The 16"" has fuller bass (such as it is).Heat and NoiseThere isn't any.None with my typical use, at least. If you push it hard, it can get warm, but not as hot as my 2016 15"". Which makes sense, as this has a larger enclosure, bigger fans, larger, better heat sinks, and more power-efficient processors. The fans don't have to spin up as much to do the same amount of cooling, so it's noticeably quieter even when it does heat up, rarely makes any noise at all.The 16"" Max comes with a larger heat sink than the 16"" Pro, so likely runs a little cooler and quieter sometimes, though the Max might get hotter when it uses a lot of that extra power.KeyboardVery quiet, much like the older Mac laptop keyboards, not the butterfly ones from 2015-19, but the rest. Maybe less travel in the keys than some of those, but plenty for me.I miss the touch bar sliders for fine control of some functions, but you can still use sliders via the Control Center, the icon next to the date on the screen's top menu bar. That's also where control of the keyboard backlight is, no more control for it on the keyboard.TouchpadThe best available by far, responsive and large so you can carry the cursor over a large area with more control. For clicks, it's great. For taps, which I turn off, it's not as great, according to those who prefer that - appears to be a software issue.PortsThere's one less Thunderbolt/USB-C port than before, but 50% more bandwidth (3 controllers instead of 2).The HDMI is 2.0, can drive up to 4K HDR @60Hz.The SD card reader is shallow, so the cards stick out. There might be room for a flush micro-SD adapter. I only have cards up to 64GB, which work fine. Some people have had trouble reading some cards, so it may be finicky.Battery LifeI usually keep plugged in, but the reviews I've seen that cover battery life tests typically say it's the longest of any similar machine they've tested, including PCs. Reports of battery life for office work, browsing, watching videos, and so on generally range from 10 to 16 hours, sometimes more. It can go unusually long with heavy use too, 5 hours or more of video work, for example. Max Tech did 10 benchmark and stress tests with it in a couple hours, some maxing out the CPU or GPU for up to ten minutes, and it still had 36% left.At normal settings, there's no performance hit until you get down to 3%; until then you can process or game at full tilt. There's a low-power mode that extends battery life by limiting performance, lowering screen brightness, etc. The Max also has a high-power mode, but it seems to only ramp up the fans sooner to help cooling. Apple's description and tests in reviews indicate it doesn't affect performance in any direct way.The Max has tended to have a little less battery life than the Pro in reviews. The only good tests I've seen that compared directly either found negligible differences or up to 15% less battery life for the Max. (Other tests haven't been well controlled.)You can quick charge to 50% in a half-hour. The new power brick is 45% more powerful than before, and maybe 30% larger lengthwise, still small for what it does. You can charge at lower speed with smaller bricks (not included) via the USB-C ports.Size and WeightIt's noticeably heavier than before, about 5 ounces over the previous 16"", and not quite as sleek, but it's sleeker than I was expecting from the photos.RepairabilityHa ha! But really, it's better than it was. Battery modules now have pull tabs so they can be more easily replaced. The screen can be replaced more easily, but if Apple doesn't do it you lose True Tone (which I don't want anyway). The headphone, Thunderbolt and MagSafe ports can be replaced without replacing the logic board. Now rates a 4/10 from iFixit for repairability, up from 1/10 for the previous model.CompatibilityComes with Rosetta 2, which enables M1 Macs to use programs written for Intel Macs, and usually works very well.There's no more Boot Camp, so to run Windows or Windows programs you have to use third-party software like Parallels, which runs Windows by emulating a Windows machine (and requires a Windows license), or Crossover, which modifies Windows programs to run on Macs.  Which works best, or at all, depends on the program.GamingWoW *mostly* runs 50 to 120fps at high settings and resolution, depending on the location. Some places can't even manage 50 at those settings, though, but do OK at more compromised settings. Baldur's Gate 3, Diablo III, CS:GO and several others can run at 60-100fps or better at good settings.You can play Windows games via Parallels or Crossover. They generally don't run as well, but some do fine.Most games, including native ones, run quite a bit better on the Max, with up to 2x the fps. Final Fantasy XIV is hit and miss at good settings even with the Max.Gaming isn't usually hot or noisy, can get warmer with light fans for the games that aren't running natively. And there's no noticeable performance hit for gaming on battery.WorkI have to mention the less fun part: how well this does things you might have to do at work. It does almost all of it better than before, much of it way better. Here's how it compares according to actual test results from numerous sources with Xcode, Logic Pro, Lightroom, Blender, Final Cut Pro, Premiere Pro, and so on. The range of comparison depends on what the task is.Previous base MBP 16"" (Intel i7 AMD 5300): The Pro is 60% to several times faster.Previous top-spec'd MBP (i9 5600M): The Pro is about the same to 2 or 3 times faster.Regular M1 machines (not M1 Pro or Max): The Pro is about the same to several times faster.The 14"" M1 Pro with same specs: The same, though the 16"" has the bigger battery and heat removal system, so it fares better in those ways.Windows laptop work stations: This is complicated, but the Pro can thrash most Windows laptops in most intensive work-related apps. It lines up very roughly with machines with a good i7/i9 and an RTX 3070, but generally can't keep up with the RTX 3080. The Pro uses a fraction of the power, and so only produces a fraction of the heat and noise, if any. And lasts and performs much better on battery.Pro vs MaxThe Max is about the same to twice as fast as the Pro, mostly between those extremes. The CPU is much the same, but the GPU is double the cores, so the main advantage is in graphics-heavy work.Besides the GPU cores, the Max has twice the bandwidth for memory transfer, two hardware video encode engines instead of one, and some extra cooling capacity.If you're already successfully using a Mac laptop, you don't *need* the Max, since the Pro is already better than what you have. But that doesn't mean you can't benefit from the Max's extra power if you have the money. For intensive video editing, massive photo editing, or better gaming (though cheaper Windows machines will play most games better), the Max has real advantages.To confuse things a little more, Apple (but not Amazon currently) also offers a demi-Max with a 24-core GPU, halfway between the Pro's 16 and the Max's 32. It's a cheaper way to get the extra bandwidth, video encoder, and cooling advantages of the Max. Tests show that in graphics-intensive tasks it operates roughly midway between the Pro and 32-core Max, often more than half, as expected.WarrantiesThis comes with a one-year limited warranty against manufacturing defects that includes free phone support for the first 90 days. If you want to also cover accidental damage (with deductibles) and extend the regular warranty and free tech support to 3 years, you can buy 

AppleCare+ from Amazon

   (link embedded) or Apple. You get 60 days from purchase to buy it, but coverage for accidents doesn't start until you do. (I always self-insure when I can, so I didn't get it.)DecalsLast and least, this comes with two black Apple decals, the sign of true professional Apple equipment."
887,Out of the box unusable for me. This MacBook Pro does not have any USB ports to be able to restore from a previous Mac back up that’s on an external drive. You must buy an adapter. Since I live in a remote area I’d have to order online and wait. You cannot even plug a iPhone12 Pro Max directly into it. The only ports it has are thunderbolt. So even Apple’s own lighting connector needs an adapter. The keyboard is a downgrade from the old keyboard. Solid black plastic instead of plastic keys surrounded by aluminum which were easier to see. Had to call Apple support to download an update because there is no reset option in the System Preferences of OS Monterey. And the update did not work to give it that option. Will have to figure out a different option to remove my account and information to return it. This particular MacBook is defective I believe.
888,I ordered the 2021 16 inch right away as I knew they would probably sell out fast. I had to make sure I had one for my trip I am leaving on soon.  As soon as I opened it the screen would never come on.  Thought maybe it needed charging so I tried that.  Still nothing but a black screen.  It kept making the sound when you open it up even when it was closed over and over again.  I took it to the local Apple Store hoping I could get some answers.  They tired to get it to work and could not either.  They said it is very strange and maybe something happened to it during shipping.  They said since it is brand new it would be best to get my money back from Amazon.  I thought maybe I could just exchange it before my trip but the one I ordered is out of stock.  I will try the 14 inch and see if I like it compared to the size of the 16 inch since it is in stock.  This is a first MacBook Pro I have ever purchased and now I am a bit nervous.
889,"Here are the temperature results for the new cool MacBooks compared to the old overheating intel ones. 91 degrees for the old one near the processor, and 74 degrees on the new ones. Both had been running for hours transferring files nonstop. Amazing. I have been editing video, transferring large files and not once have the fans kicked on. Makes me want to cry."
890,"Finally, this 2021 MacBook Pro cured my depression!"
891,Arrived DOA - wouldn’t start up. Spent hours on the phone with Apple support and still wouldn’t start. Returned - c’mon man!
892,"This laptop is unbelievably fast. Between the screen, battery life, and performance, this laptop is head and shoulders better than any competition."
893,My first ever MacBook. Switched over from PC and I can't believe I didn't switch sooner! On the pricer side but I'm super happy with my purchase!
894,"I have been using my MacBook Pro from 2014 for work until last week when I finally purchased this MacBook Pro. My old MacBook starts up and works as fast as the day I bought it. The only reason I bought a new MacBook was because the battery life was getting low. I probably could have just bought a new battery and it would have been fine.That being said, I did hold out for this MacBook because Apple brought back the ports that I needed. I use the HDMI and SD ports daily. An Ethernet port would have been nice but that’s asking too much. This MacBook has a 2 day battery life and is blazing fast. I use Adobe programs and this MacBook doesn’t even blink when I do live editing. Best laptop I have ever used.I own a business that uses many PC laptops and a couple MacBooks. A PC will never last as long as a MacBook. And, a PC ALWAYS gets slower after 6 months of use. The price is high but you can buy a new PC every 2 years or a MacBook every 7 years."
895,"Coming from a 2019 16in, I feel that this generation is 2 steps forwards, 1 step back.Pros:-Fans are never audible even under full extended load!  This was my #1 issue with my 2019 mac which would have constant fan noise with 2 monitors.-2x battery life-Better screen especially in dark environment or a dark subject-Extremely fast for certain workloads such as video editing and code compilation.-magsafe is back (although I personally don't care for it)-most apps work normally with rosetta emulation, but may have some stutter.Cons:-thicker and SIGNIFICANTLY heavier.-Screen has a notch which is very distracting for me.-Still has some compatibility issues.-Terrible for games.  Only a few titles are supported natively.  I only tested league of legends(uses rosetta emulator), but it was choppy and 1/3 the fps of my 2019 intel macbook.- +$300 base price even though they got rid of intel.-The area I feel apple has made a major misstep is with ports.  I couldn't care less for SD card or HDMI, but everyone who buys this is going to need USB-A.  It's ridiculous that I still have to bring a dongle everywhere just to use my mouse but these ports I never/rarely use are back.Also some developer related tools/libraries aren't working.C# debugger is totally unsupported for example.  Anything that requires gpu hardware acceleration (pytorch) is unlikely to ever be supported in any usable form.  Linux dual boot is unsupported or in early experimental stages.  I also had issues building/running java projects natively, but no issues with rosetta.If you're looking to buy this for an undergrad program, it's probably workable.  However, I'd suggest saving some $ and getting a used mac or windows machine.  Professional devs will be aware of their specific requirements, but I suspect many will need to keep a secondary x86 machine for the foreseeable future."
896,"I am writing this review focused primarily on people who are considering jumping from the 13"" MacBook Pro to the 14"" MacBook Pro, which is what I did. I moved from the 13"" MacBook Pro M1 with 16gb of RAM to the 14"" MacBook Pro M1 Pro with 16gb of RAM.Size: So, 1"" of screen might not seem like a lot on its face, but the difference is pretty substantial, in my opinion. Even the pictures don't quite do it justice. The screen feels considerably larger in a package that isn't considerably larger. For me, it's the perfect sweet spot for someone who wants something larger than the 13"" model, but smaller than the 16"". I had a 16"" MacBook Pro i9 and it was just too much for me. This one feels perfect.Form Factor: The new 14"" and 16"" MacBooks both adopt a thicker chassis, which is shown in the pictures. As such, Apple decided to make the casing flat instead of gently rounded. It honestly reminds me of the pre-unibody builds, but still sleek and modern. If I didn't know this one was new and you just laid them side-by-side, I might say that the old form factor looks a little newer, but that isn't to say that it looks bad.Aesthetics: Overall, I touched on the aesthetics a bit in the ""form factor"" section. It looks like a high-end laptop, but at the same time I can see some people thinking it looks dated. I personally like the flatter look over the more rounded look, but it will depend on the person. Another thing I like is moving the ""MacBook Pro"" branding from under the screen to the bottom of the casing. I just think it provides a cleaner look during use. The black background of the keyboard is also a plus for me. The old space gray background was fine, but I really like the black.Function: Most people probably won't notice a massive difference in the previous iteration and the new iteration. For the 14"" and 16"" MacBook Pros, the touchbar has been removed. This will make a lot of people happy. For me, I was always pretty ambivalent about the touchbar, but I'm not going to complain about a key row there. The keyboard appears to have ever so slightly more travel and bounce. It's not a huge amount, but it is noticeable. I'll touch on The Notch later.Performance: My 13"" had the M1 chip and now my 14"" as the M1 Pro. So far, I haven't noticed a tremendous difference when using programs like Logic Pro, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Lightroom, but I wouldn't say those are super intensive programs. If you're exporting massive 8K videos, you might want to jump up to the M1 Max. One thing I have noticed is that the thermals are maybe a little bit worse. Just a touch. I have noticed it warming up a bit, but the fan still has not come on once. I only mention this because my 13"" M1 stayed cold at all times. It's not as bad as my i9, which sounded like a jet engine revving up while it jumped well over 100 degrees, but it's something to be aware of.The Notch: Honestly, so much has been made of the notch and I think it's mostly overstated. Yes, it's fun to meme the fact that Apple still hasn't found a way around the notch, particularly on iPhones, but it's really not a huge deal. Were it up to me, I would have just left a bezel up there, but I can understand why Apple didn't. I use a Dell XPS for work and it has razor thin bezels with no notch, but at the same time the camera is an absolute joke. Looks like it's from 2002.The Notch (cont'd): The notch behavior can be inconsistent from app to app, but not to the point where it's bothersome. I have seen some programs with very large nav menus up top bump the status bar out of the way to make room. And while this particular phenomenon is not something new for MacBooks, losing a big chunk of that bar to the notch will likely make this a more regular occurrence for people. Do I wish it didn't have a notch? Yeah, probably. Does it hurt the experience? Very, very little.Screen: For everyday indoor use, which is almost exclusively what I do, I think you will be hard-pressed to find a better screen on the market. The 120Hz refresh rate is something I waited a long time to get on the iPhone, so I was pretty shocked to see it implemented on the new MacBook Pros just a month later. It actually has more pixels/inch than the iMac 27"" 5K screen, which I also use pretty regularly. All-in-all, the screen is just the best in the business.Overall: It's a great and powerful laptop for someone who is wanting a little more than web surfing and word processing. I use mine primarily for recording music, as well as live performances using standalone plugins, so I need something that is powerful and easy to use. The MacBook Pro has always fit the bill, but now with the M1, M1 Pro, and M1 Max chips, I have absolutely no concern for performance or consistency.My 13"" M1 did just what I needed in this regard, but I'm someone who wanted a slightly larger screen without drastically increasing my footprint and weight. The 14"" MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip is just what I needed. If you're someone who needs absolutely top notch performance, I'd recommend upgrading the RAM and going with the M1 Max."
897,"I haven't upgraded my computer for more than a decade, so it would stand to reason any recent releases would impress me, but this macbook pro has gone above and beyond in the small time I've had it.The screen is truly something to behold. Smooth, clear, just beautiful. I don't typically care about bezels, but I might start. The expanded screen makes an unexpected difference. Meanwhile, I barely notice the notch. Apple said they'd find workarounds to make it scarce, and they have.The speakers are wonderful as well. I was skeptical at first -- thought I caught some tinny effects on a couple songs, but the more I listen to them, the more I'm convinced the tinniness was in the recording (it was a live album, which might explain it). As for the spatial audio, I've only heard a couple songs, but it's pretty trippy. This is my first experience with it, and it doesn't disappoint.In the short time I've had the computer, it's been nothing but fast. Probably more computer than I need, so if you're a sound editor or photographer, this review probably isn't for you. But for those of you casual users who want a solid machine that will last (as I said, my last macbook pro made it more than a decade), this is the one. Excited as I was for my last macbook, I could see room for improvement at the time. Right now, I don't see how things get better than this."
898,"M1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. Compared to previous MacBook Pro, it's a giant leap ahead. These tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the Macbook. This particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro,  but it still kicks butt. You can get the Pro Max chip and bump up the RAM to 64GB if you want - and add tons more storage. The 14 inch MacBook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. It can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. The display is stunning. Just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. The brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. Real HDR viewing -  a big difference. You will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. After 10 minutes I don't even notice it. It means nothing for your experience. Its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. Camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous MacBooks. Six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. Music/movies it feels like surround sound. For video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. The keyboard is a dream to type on. Very solid like all MacBooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. The Apple Magic Keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. Battery life is amazing. I have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. At best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! Especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it won't be 17 hours but I did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. The power efficiency is ground breaking. They have added back the MagSafe power plug - which is great! And added back an SD card slot and and an HDMI port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. I wish it had at least one USB-A old style port - but it doesn't. You get three USB-C thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. They got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro MacBooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. Apparently they listened to a lot of users who didn't really like the touch pad. The shape and style of this laptop is great. Some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. That is BS. I have been typing most of the day and I don't feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. Very comfy for typing. Some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new Macbook Pro, but I am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside -  this is an amazing laptop - the best Apple has ever made, hands down. And I would say you won't find a better power laptop anywhere.  All that said - this is not a gamers machine. Apple is not for hard core gamers. I mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. I am a hard core gamer and a PC geek  - I have a powerful windows PC for gaming. And always will. But for everything else. this MacBook is king. I use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. I can plut into a giant monitor if I want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch IPS panel. So if you are wondering if this Macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - I am here to tell you, its the real deal. I finally upgraded from my 2015 MacBook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. If you are thinking of getting one - you won't be disappointed. One last comment. I am an old timer windows guy, and I know all the counter arguments for the Mac. Many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. First, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new M1 Pro chips - you can't. And aside from that, the Mac OS is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text FROM A PHOTO! Whaaat? And the design/ergonomics/quality of these MacBooks is unmatched. So, yes you pay more - but you get more. My last MacBook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. If you want this laptop - get it! It rocks."
899,"I have a Mabook Pro covered by Apple care. The computer needs a new battery. To make a long story short Apple left me for months with a computer, again under warranty, which I can use for a couple of hours for simple tasks like web browsing before it needs to be recharged. Apple refused to replace the battery because the diagnostic read 81% not below 80 % as per policy. In all this Apple didn’t have any problems asking me to invest countless hours of my time between doing clean installs trips to apple stores etc.. I feel a more respectful way to treat me as a loyal customer could have been let us replace the battery first and if that doesn’t fix the issue which I seriously doubt ask me to do troubleshooting. All this to save something that would probably cost you few $$. Seriously ?"
900,sent me base model
901,"I probably got a faulty laptop but the charger status doesn’t show it’s charging when plugged in, only thing indicating that it’s charging is the orange light. My chrome windows keeps crashing whenever I put the computer to sleep and the external video display rarely connects"
902,"I never write reviews, but feel compelled to write one for this Macbook Pro. I've owned macs consistently since 1990s and have dealt with eye strain on the air and now on this laptop. It gave me horrible headaches and eye strain even with a matte protector. I returned it and am now looking at PCs for the first time because if I can't read from the screen without it making me sick, I can't use it."
903,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   My first MacBook ever! I had been saving up for it before the official drop— & I was not disappointed! Love the Touch ID feature, and it’s so efficient! Can’t wait to use it when I go back to school!"
904,"This laptop has a superior display, superior speakers, superior camera and an excellent keyboard. Don't go cheap and buy the ""affordable"" MacBook Air base model like some of these talking heads have been advising. It's not a good buy if you are unhappy with it after six months, and believe me, you will be unhappy with 8 GB of RAM and two USB ports after six months. M1 MacBooks are not upgradeable so if you find that you need more RAM, you are stuck. Unless all you are doing sending emails, tweets, and watching TicTok, you will probably need something more, especially if you are using your laptop for work. I'm using my MacBook Pro with an LG UltraFine 5K 27 inch display as my desktop system, which replaces a 27 inch iMac. I'm very happy."
905,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Sheeeese! What can I say? Apple has done it again 🤪😍 magnificent piece of device I must say."
906,"I pulled the trigger on this thing hoping that the bad reviews were wrong.. some of the comments saying it came dirty and defective definitely gave me pause however, what arrived today was practically a brand new macbook. the device does not show any signs of wear and the battery cycle count is 18, it came with the original power brick and while the cable was used, it was not worn or dirty in any way. While i've only just started using the device about an hour ago, I can tell you that it's speedy and works flawlessly... had I not known it was a refurb when buying it, I would have easily confused it for a brand new mbp.. for those asking, this is a 2017 macbook pro and the specs as quoted are accurate. i'll play around with this thing for a little while and update this review as needed, but so far this looks like a winner!***update***A few months in and it’s still working flawlessly. I don’t regret my purchase for one second, and neither should you!"
907,This is not a 256GB MacBook Pro- they are falsely advertising it as such and then shipping buyers 128GB versions.
908,"Came in used and dirty, and it was not even turn off, I'm gonna return it. So disappointed."
909,"Wow. I cant say enough how happy I am with this laptop! I it arrived early, and for a refurbished computer I swear it doesn't have a scratch, dent, smudge or single flaw anywhere on it! Its fast, the battery is great, its working perfectly! I couldn't be happier with this thing!"
910,"Was excited to receive it and on the outside it had one noticable chip in the case on the cover side (which had a sharp edge to it), but thought that isn't too bad.  But when opening it up the screen in both the top left and top right were broken/chipped/cracked like it had been dropped and they replaced the cover, but not the screen.  This was not acceptable.  Wanted to try it out and ended up learning that some of the keys did not work right (sticky, pushed strange and such), plus the touchpad/mouse was really strange and didn't seem to work correctly.  Too many issues out of the box for me and too concerned that there might be other issues from where it looked to have been dropped and such.  Sending it back and just started that process.  So far the return seems ok....but just hate that the product does not match the description...using their words ""Renewed products work and look like new""."
911,"I ordered the space gray with 256 gb of ram and received a silver with 128gb.  I knew this could happen as the picture did not match the description and I had seen other similar reviews.The good news is it was on time and in flawless condition.  I think I will stick with it and not press my luck, as it is still a fair price and a great machine, but beware."
912,"I have to admit, I don't typically write reviews and I was a little hesistant about the product due to some 1 to two star reviews. The space gray model not only is at a great price, it came to me brand new. With all the specs I was expecting, i5 8GB RAM 256GB SSD, and works like a dream. Battery life is great, setting up was easy, and all my Apple Products (iPhone, Apple watch, Earpods) synced with no issues. I'm not sure as to why there were so many negative reviews, but mine is not one of them. SO HAPPY!! I truly recommend."
913,the battery is dead
914,"This product arrived quickly and looked great.  There have been multiple glitches with the power switch and with the screen ever since it's arrival.  Most of the time the power button would require multiple attempts to push before the computer would power up.  When the computer woke from sleep state (opening lid after its been closed for at least fifteen minutes) the screen would be black and then all pixelated.  Most recently, the computer wouldn't even turn on, when it finally did, it was all reset and all the settings were reset.  I lost everything I had put on the computer over the past day.  The seller still hasn't gotten back to me after email and I left a voice message.  I have now initiated a return as I want my money back.  It would have been nice if they had gotten back to me ASAP when I emailed or when I called (during normal hours of operation, by the way) and it went to voicemail.  The fact that they didn't and the computer kept coming up with other issues.  I now will buy a new one.  The value is not there with the aggravation generated."
915,"Multiple reviews mentioned getting devices with used batteries, screen issues, etc.My laptop arrived through FedEx Express with questionable packaging. But everything was intact and fine. The laptop still had the plastic wrapped around it as MacBooks directly from Apple do, even with the screen cover. Only 3 battery cycles out of the box, with a new charger in the box. I am very satisfied with the purchase although in the Q&A section of this product someone mentions that this is a 2018 model, its not, its a 2017 (At least the one I received.) which for me isn't really a big deal since it arrived in exceptional condition. Highly recommend this MacBook."
916,I'm a fan of apple products and I like almost everything about this new MBA. But it has one huge flaw that nobody talks about. It's the camera hardware and it hasn't been updated in ages. My zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light. A $1000 laptop with 10 year old front camera is unacceptable. Camera is very important to me. Especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time.
917,"Liked:- Long battery life (one charge WILL last all day, i.e. 16 hours. Personally tested true)- Speed (the new M1 processor really is fast)- Quiet (no fan but the laptop still does not get hot)- Light and portable- High resolution & bright displayDisliked:- As with other MacBooks, the keyboard is mediocre especially compared to laptops like Lenovo Thinkpad- Incompatible applications (With the M1 processor still being new, you might experience existing programs frequently crash. For example, Chrome keeps crashing) But I would guess there will be a fix soon"
918,"UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable.The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long.Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using ""swap memory"" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board.***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB.I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models.There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD.***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly.------I purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12"" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1.The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco.I likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive ""Pro Apps"" running at the same time.I would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.I would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball ""not responding"" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1. If however, you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable, faster and cooler running than the Intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable Mac."
919,"The M1 chip really is amazing. But it only lasted five days for me. Somehow mine managed to break after using a third party USB C hub. The screen wouldn’t turn on at all, and an Apple repair tech couldn’t figure it out after doing a few quick tests. Oh and then Apple said it would take a month to replace it with a new one."
920,"Beautiful laptop. I’ve upgraded from the MacBook Air of old...so far this laptop has blown it away. It wasn’t overly pricey to be honest and I feel it’s worth the price. Overall look is great and keyboard feel is nice. Larger touchpad is great, I’ve paired my Magic Trackpad 2 with it as well."
921,"I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13"" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13"" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.Good:- SCREEN looks great!  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  I usually don't go above 50% brightness.- KEYBOARD is good.  Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard.  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic.  Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great.  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.- LOOKS GREAT.  Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.- NO FAN.  That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.- PERFORMANCE.  It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time.  For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU.  Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27"" (top end) with Intel chips.- TOUCH ID is great still.  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons.  On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA.  Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch).  You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay.  And so on and so forth.- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.NOT GOOD:- WEBCAM still sucks.  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc.  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27"" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera).- ONLY 2 PORTS.  Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort).  Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame.  I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.OVERALL:A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem.  Love it so far!"
922,No complains so far.  Very fast and performs great.  I had a 2014 MacBook Air and finally upgraded this year.  This is leagues beyond that entry and I’m very happy with this upgrade.
923,"Lightweight, blazing fast, easy to use, battery life is incredible with the new Apple M1 chip.  A typical Great Apple product.However, there is only a Thunderbolt port, so you now have to go out and buy a cable to convert USB to thunderbolt (if you want to use a backup hard drive) or other USB items, AND, I had to buy yet another cable to sync my phone's lightning port to the thunderbolt port on the computer. Total $56.I LOVE Apple product, and worked for them in my caerer, but I would wait on buying this version until the software for it has been developed.UPDATE: After several months of using this computer, I have have found several things of concern:1.  my notification center keeps disappearing, despite my constant reinstalling the widgets.2.  my computer's calendar, reminders, and photo stream do not sync with my IOS devices (iPhone & iPad).  If I add an item to calendar on my phone, it will appear on my mac but not vice versa.  Reminders will not sync regardless of which device I originate the item on.I have contacted Apple support on all these issues and they cannot solve the problem.IT APPEARS THAT THE BUGS HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED OUT, YET.  THINGS ARE MADDENINGLY CLUNKY!"

   Bought this laptop bc i needed it for spring semester and i needed an upgrade from my heavy macbook pro. I go to work too so i needed something super light and thin i can just bring everywhere and slide it in my bag.I am obsessed with how fast this macbook is. The battery life is on point. I used it for movies and series at work and it lasted for 3 days. The processor is definitely sooo good. I open so many tabs at once and it has not lagged on me. The keyboard and trackpad is responsive.I love the color. The main reason why i bought this too. 😍😂I have no problems with it at all.Highly recommend"
925,Opened my brand new $1000++ computer and the entire screen was cracked and destroyed. Awesome! Thanks Amazon.
926,"Delivered to me within 12 hours of purchase... Sealed in original apple packaging with protective film, blemish free, not a scratch.. Mint.its powerful, Ive already loaded some big task audio software and broadcast software on it and its flying through the multiple processes together at ease... (Logic 10.5 / Traktor DJ 3.0 / OBS)Super light and portable, If this is a MacBook Pro then I can't even imagine how light the Air models are. Nor could I even imagine why you may need something more powerful. I am having to adjust to the new keyboard and Touch Bar, I keep hitting Siri and volume settings, even as I type this.id also recommend getting a keyboard cover as well.... I hear these keyboards go out sometimes and to repair it. This is no fault to the reseller, but I can't believe Apple with their price points don't offer a bigger SSD for the lowest price point.... 128gb is laughable so be prepared to buy an external SSD along with a Thunderbolt 3 / USB-C Hub to run hdmi, and various external accessories.Overall I love this computer so far, it was a nail biter as I rarely ever shell out $1,000 on anything but I'm very pleased and satisfied with my purchase. And I still cannot find a better deal on the internet, not even used on Facebook marketplace, letgo or craigslist....Five stars"
927,So not worth it. All they want to do is take your money do NOT BUY THIS ONE! Its used and if you search apple on amazon they have brand new with higher stats for cheaper.
928,"Just received this, but so far so good. It looks BRAND NEW. There are literally NO signs of cosmetic wear or damage. It arrived in a sealed apple box. I’m finishing setting up and I already love it. For just under $1,200 for a 2019 model, this is a GREAT deal!"
929,"I really love my MacBook. I really love this laptop. I'm a huge MacBook fan and this works like new. So far I don't have a problem with the butterfly keyboard, but I heard bad reviews about the keyboard from watching YouTube videos. I think that they may have fixed the keyboard problem when they refurbished the product??? I'm not sure, but honestly this a really great laptop for a really great price. I do wish that it came in the original Apple box and packaging, but it wasn't far from the really deal."
930,"It looks and feels brand spanking new! Definitely happy with my purchase considering that I bought a brand new 2020 MacBook Air and hated it. Returned it back in 2 days. I paid a lot less for the Pro than the Air and its A LOT better with so many features. I’m not trying to persuade anyone out of getting the Air but if you are considering on buying a MacBook my advice would be to just go ahead and get the pro. The Air reminds me of a google chrome book slapped with an Apple logo on it. Not saying that google chrome books are bad, but there’s no need to pay a full band for the Air when you could find something similar and a lot cheaper. All in all I really love this laptop."
931,"Bought this laptop with some apprehensions, as i have typically bought refurbished goods from apple directly. This was my first from amazon, and i was not disappointed. The notebook was flawless, not a single scratch on it. second, all the accessories where flawless as well, not signs of usage. When i powered on the notebook to verify usage, the battery had cycled only 3 times, meaning it was still in new condition. Very highly recommended seller. Thanks for a pleasant transaction."
932,"This laptop looked new, straight from Apple store."

934,"Although I was very skeptical about purchasing a ""refurbished"" MacPro, after reading the reviews for this company, I made the purchase.  The MacPro arrived earlier than expected, expertly wrapped, included Apple certified, and in NEW condition.  There is no way I could tell it was not new or refurbished.  The price was the best I could find after researching other sellers.  I would highly recommend iPower Resale Inc to anyone looking for a MacPro.  Their customer service is exceptional.  Thank you for a great product!  5*****"
935,"When I looked at this product it only had one review and it was a bad one... I then checked all the other products the seller sold and the reviews were excellent, needless to say I took a chance and ordered this MacBook Pro 2019. It arrived before anticipated and it was securely package. I AM SO GLAD I took a chance on them because this MacBook is amazing! Now I’ve waited a couple months before reviewing it to make sure it works. The MacBook looks brand new, it didn’t have any dents or scratches. It works and performs like a new MacBook. I had to contact the seller over the a small issue with the charger and they went above and beyond to correct the issue.Excellent customer service excellent product. I recommend this seller to anyone!"
936,"I got my new MacBook Pro M1 two weeks ago and could not be more happy with it. This machine is absolutely incredible in terms of speed, looks, weight/size, display, and battery life - and texture (it feels so good against the skin on my wrists as I type) and basically anything else you can think of. I also love the space gray color, the new keyboard, the Touch Bar, and the larger trackpad. There are so many options to customize the system to work just the way I like.My previous MacBook was the 2011 model and it still works today, but after 10 years it became too slow and the trackpad had trouble clicking, so after a TON of research, I decided to pull the trigger and get the New MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.A couple suggestions I am able to give after spending almost two months and probably over 30 hours researching the new MacBook are: go with the standard model of 8gb of RAM and the 256 ssd - you can get this on Amazon for $1239 vs $1299 at Apple - so you get to save 60 bucks, and you have the added satisfaction of not having to deal with the snobby nerd losers that work in the Apple Store, who asked me rudely when I went in to get a new laptop ""umm, do you have an appointment? Well, you're going to have to make an appointment if you want to go in the store"". I love Apple products and will never use another phone or computer besides the iPhone and MacBook, but after that experience I will never again give my business to the physical Apple Stores. I mean, seriously, do you really need me to make an appointment to buy a $1300 laptop? Whatever dude.Anyway, in several YouTube videos that compared the 8GB ram model along side the 16GB ram model (costs 200 bucks more), the 8GB performed just as well in nearly every task - and they really pushed it to the limits. The only reason to pay up for the 16GB RAM is if you want to edit 8K UHD videos or are a super serious music recording artist or highly advanced professional photographer - and even then it's not too much of a difference. For the every day user (me or basically anyone who is not a computer professional) the 8GB working with this new M1 chip is mind-blowing, blows any other laptop on the market completely out of the water, and actually even performs just as well as the $2200 15 inch MacBook Pro using the Intel chip. As far as the storage goes, 256 ssd is standard - that's what I got - and you can pay 200 bucks more for 512 ssd or 400 bucks more for 1 TB. But with the Cloud storage available now, you don't really need to keep much on the laptop drive, you can just save it to the cloud.Overall I honestly could go on for hours about every little detail that I absolutely love about this machine. A free one year subscription to Apple TV is also another little perk. But I am still mystified every day at how incredible this machine is. I've been online for over 3 hours now and its still on 92% battery. The new Retina display is brilliant. Everything is perfect. I truly am in love this laptop and would recommend that anyone looking for a new laptop to last a long time and outperform everything else on the market gets the new matchbook 13 inch M1."
937,I bought my Mac from Apple directly not from Amazon. This thing is amazing. Battery life is awesome. Hard to believe that I can work with it all day and do not have to charge at all even with bright screen.No issues with speed at all. I use Matlab a lot and this computer is even slightly faster than my desktop with 12 core AMD CPU and 32 GB ram.Excellent machine. Happy I bought it.
938,"I own over 50 computers and it blows away my 11th gen Dell XPS 13 i7, My surface Book 3, my Ryzen 7 Thinkpad. the first week I got it the battery lasted for 5 days and 22 hrs of use and still had 20% left. I felt guilty and charged it. The Geekbench 5 rating beat all those listed laptops and they had 16 or 32GB of memory and the MacBook Pro M1 had only 8GB of unified memory. The keyboard felt great, the sound was superb, the screen bright, and it was blazing fast in all I did. I'm an IT consultant and deal in Windows based databases and this Mac has now become my daily go to system at home. It has become my new front end."
939,It's a Mac once you go Mac you never go back. This is my second Mac my first lasted almost 9 years.
940,Dead at arrival.... kernel error. Took it to the Apple store they told me looks like a hardware failure and to send it back to Amazon.
941,"I'm going to preface this review with the 1 thing I dislike so we can get that out of the way.I mean let's be honest, that's what most people are looking for when buying a product-the down sides.It has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack EVEN THOUGH apple quit using that on it's handheld products years ago.Not that I care, it's good that they include the 3.5mm jack-but how come they didn't include one for their lightning connector that their headphones come in out of the box? Forces you to either change to a standard headphone jack or BT headphones (probably trying to push their AirPods line).Other than that, I have no issues. It's fast, efficient, reliable and easy to use. If your familiar with iOS on these then it'll be a great addition to the tech team you have at home."
942,"I love my new MacBook Pro!!  It’s the 13” and not too small. It’s very lightweight!  It’s so fast!  I was using an older MacBook Pro from mid 2012. It worked well, just so slow. This one flies!!  I was disappointed that there are no USB ports or CD player. I spent about $65 at Best Buy and got an adapter that works very well!!!"
943,The battery lasts forever and its fast. My last macbook had a pretty good battery and worked very well for years too.The M1 does allow for dual external monitors and there are two usbc ports total. These two things can be worked around with dongles and a video hub but now I have $200 worth of accessories and a tangled mess on my desk.How is a 2020 Mac not compatible with dual monitors but my 2005 HP works great with the same monitor setup?!? I really can't get past that.Get the intel version with 4 USB ports and you can use it in your Covid home office out of the box.
944,"There is no fix for this, and now it can't be returned.  All that money wasted!!! There is a vertical black line on the screen.  I tried to fix it using tips from youtube videos and none of it worked.  Proceed with caution!"
945,"I really wanted to love this laptop. I've had only Macs for years. This was supposed to be an upgrade from my 2014 MacBook Air. I previously had a 2020 16"" intel based MacBook Pro for work configured with two HP monitors. No issues with the monitors and connected instantly with zero effort to get the screens to work with the laptop. Bought this one and connected to my Belkin hub for the HDMIs. Would only connect a single monitor. Googled the issue and found that the new M1 apple chip only supports a single monitor. News to me and I guess I should have researched more. However the low rating stems from the fact that this is a PRO laptop. A professional would want two monitors and should not have to google whether a PRO laptop supports more than 1 monitor when the intel version does seamlessly. Despite this I had planned to keep it and just deal with 1 monitor because of the cost savings over buying the Intel based MacBook Pro and wanted the longer battery life. Now brings me to the issue that made me return the laptop. This laptop just would not configure to show a clear resolution with my monitors. The scale was off and the display just stayed blurry no matter what setting I changed it to on the monitor or the laptop's settings. Tried and tried and just gave up. Returned this and ordered an Intel based 13"" MacBook Pro. No issues, supports dual monitors, and seamlessly integrated to the laptop. No blurry screen and no having to set or change any settings to get it to work. I am floored that Apple would produce a Pro for business that only supports a single monitor. I love Apple but will not buy anything with their chip until the kinks are worked out."
946,This is by far the best laptop ive ever owned! The laptop came with 0 scratches and only 16 battery charges on it. It even came with the apple box and stickers! Highly reccomend for the price. $850 is great for a 2019 macbook air.
947,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Everything I expected and more! Just like brand new!"
948,I love this laptop so so much. I think everyone should get it. The model is between 2018-2020 and the one I got had the Touch ID on it! Everything was very easy to set up and is in such great quality!
949,"Received in a timely manner.  Will review in a couple weeks.Well, it's been over 2 weeks since receiving my MacBook Air and I have to admit that it has proven to be worth it's price. The Retina display is phenomenal and it's compact chassis is just what I was looking for. I am not a power user, so I didn't need major memory capacity. The speakers are, surprisingly, crisp and clear for such a slim build. The fingerprint scanner is quick and a huge convenience. I am (or was) a long-time PC user and resisted getting an Apple, but the transition was smooth and Apple's claim to fame for being user-friendly and intuitive proved true. If you are looking for a compact, yet capable laptop with QWERTY keyboard, I would recommend this product."
950,"After having the laptop a few months, I can say my leap of faith to buy an amazon refurbished was worth it BUT I had to work a little bit.  It didn't arrive perfect and it still isn't perfect.  There is a tiny white dot on the screen where some pixels died (I guess) and when I first got it, I had to call Apple support to get iMessage and Facetime to work on it.  Then I had to take it to the Apple store to get the keyboard fixed as some keys would not work.  Thankfully, I had Apple Care on it so the cost to get it shipped off and fixed wasn't bad.  Overall, I am happy with my purchase and I recommend this seller, but I will probably buy new next time."
951,"** I have only had the laptop for a week, this review is only based off of the time I have had it**I was so nervous to buy a refurbished computer but this came like it was brand new. New packaging, new charger, spotless laptop. I was worried the battery would be bad and wouldn’t hold a charge. I was wrong. I downloaded over 12,000 photos and was on it nonstop for over 2 days without even having to charge it. I am in love with this!!!"
952,"As in the description exactly, thank the seller for the fast shipping and good packaging"
953,I love this laptop and I’m really happy with all the features. Would definitely recommend.
954,Exactly as expected. Great value.
955,"The product made a loud buzzing/grinding airplane-type noise as soon as it finished setting up which was truly deafening. I presume it was the fan producing this aggravating sound. No programs were running and the room was approximately 68 degrees Fahrenheit so overheating should not have been an issue. Since no computer should ever sound like a coffee maker at any time, I must conclude that it was defective. Return to sender."
956,Exceeded my expectations! Some of the reviews had me a bit nervous but I can’t tell you how happy I am! The laptop is on almost brand new condition! Only 1 TINY nick on the front (you can’t see it unless your looking) and it was perfectly ready for me to set up my account! No issues or problems! It comes in a box perfectly protected and has the charger to go with as well👍🏼 So happy with it! Thank you!
957,"I was so excited because this laptop came in perfect condition. But when I tried to change the unsername to my name it wouldn’t work. 3 calls to Apple later, and I find out this computer is owned by a school that can remotely access my laptop at any time. Meaning, if they wanted to they could shut down and erase my laptop. Amazon gave me a full refund but I am very sad and disappointed"
958,"All in all, the laptop works great! It runs fast, it’s clean, and it’s perfect for what I needed it. The one disappointment I have it they claimed this product as a catagory A which means like new. When it arrived, the screen had two scratch marks on it that was discolored from the rest of the screen. I would understand like new for any other part to have a scratch, but the screen is a big deal and it should have mentioned that in the details."
959,"This MacBook Air is amazing!  I had been previously using a 2007 MacBook Air and it was time to upgrade.  I have never purchased refurbished before so I really didn't know what to expect, though was greatly concerned.  Needless to say that this laptop heavily exceeded my expectations.  Other reviewers stated that their MacBook was not as described, though mine looks brand new.  The keys are still crisp and clean, the screen immaculate.  There are a few light scratches on the outside of the computer (mostly the underside), but it is very minimal and unnoticeable.It runs like a dream, though I have only begun using it.  I will update should the computer have any issues.  It is an early 2015 with 4 GB RAM and its OS is Sierra.  I wanted to share that, as I found the Q&A to be a little confusing on that point and other reviews didn't really mention it."
960,"When I received this package, I was thrilled...until I tried to turn it on and got a “low battery” notification...for 16+ hours. Turns out the cord provided (not a Mac product) is not the correct wattage to charge this device. It’s hard to tell at this point if the computer is faulty or not now that I’ve purchased a new cord from Best Buy, but it shuts down as soon as it’s disconnected from power. The screen is pretty floppy, too- falls back without provocation. All of which seem like things that should have been mentioned in the details before I decided to purchase.After taking this computer to the Apple store, I was informed that the issue was indeed the battery- completely bad and had to be replaced. Again, something that I wish I had known before purchasing. It is in working order now, but doesn’t meet my standards of what “certified refurbished” means, and product details lacking for sufficient purchasing knowledge ahead of time."
961,"It said I had to do an update. When I hit the only update allowed it said the latest version was already installed but it wouldn’t let me go foward.  Also the screen seemed loose.  So if it was cleared out they never installed the new software correctly. So it wouldn’t let me even get to the main screen.  Others had luck but I did not.Also when I plugged the power bar in. It had a bit of a shock come out. As an electrician, I know that was a big no no.  I was willing to spend the money and get the correct power cord. But with everything else. I thought that’s already 3 strikes. No thanks."
962,I was very hesitant buying a used MacBook from Amazon but it turned out great! Looks new and works amazingly. You will receive exactly what was described. I have no complaints!
963,"Good quality, arrived early. As-new condition. Easy to install from my old machine via time machine backup. The old one was a 2010, now we are good for another 5-7 years.Thanks"
964,I have been struggling with this product since day one. I am not getting responses from the seller OR the extended warranty repair company.I have never had trouble with Amazon before. Every issue I have ever had has been settled with ease and courtesy.This has not. Made more devastating as it it is the largest purchase I have had and the product has been unusable almost since day one. We sent it to the extended warranty place who said they fixed it but it still doesn’t work.We have spent hours at Apple doing diagnostics and it is simply not functional. To repair it would cost more than I paid. They do not think that the parts it was refurbished with are even Apple parts.This was a terrible product and not worth the money.
965,"I bought this Mac and it came with a non Apple charger, I bought this as travel computer, sure enough in the first week while I was in Europe I had to buy am authentic Apple charger at $117. Now a month  later my Mac has died. It was having issues as in when I tried to maximize the scene with Netflix it would just shrink to a 3x5"" screen volume,  also the screen had been replaced before I bought it and is not well attached, very disappointed, I bought this last summer, but only started to use it in October when I was traveling, so I spent close to $700 for a Mac that lasted 2 months, return and replacement window has ""closed"" so I am stuck with a hefty repair bill."
966,"Was very iffy about buying refurbished but it’s honestly like new! There are a couple of LITTLE scratches but nothing noticeable! Compared to my friends MacBook Air that she paid 1100$ for and they are the absolute same. Best $500 I’ve ever spent. & the company is AWESOME! The charger didn’t work as soon as I got it & I emailed them. Within an hour I had an email from them and they were sending me a new charger, thankful my friend had her charger that I used until I received mine but the battery last like 2-3 days so it wasn’t that bad."
967,"Seller: IT5050Wowie! My son wanted an Apple Computer for Christmas and I was not about to spend $1000+ on a laptop for a 11-year-old boy. But a refurbished MacBook was definitely priced more appropriate for him. This computer is AMAZING people!!! Looks so clean and new. Only a couple faint scratches on the bottom, the keyboard looks like it was hardly touched, screen is clear and no burn marks in it, plus the battery is great. The seller was so awesome to get me this gift in time for Christmas, they are quick to respond to emails and followed up to make sure it was delivered afterward. (seriously, the nicest people!) I had purchased another renewed MacBook from another seller, and their level of quality wasn’t as good, by far. I wish I could pre-select a quality grade for the laptop (excellent, good, fair, etc.), so it is a little scary just leaving it up to the unknown. I work in the retail business and I like to applaud small companies who sell quality products. Do yourself a favor and go here, they gave me a laptop that is stellar and eased my worries about a refurbished laptop. It really looks so good and is operating perfectly. This is such a smarter way to buy a computer, especially for kids, or if you like to have the pricier brands without spending the high price. – Happy Mommy!"
968,"Wow! Bought this from TECHarvard and was claimed to be Certified Refurbished, which according to the Amazon description should show limited to no signs of wear.  Well the device that I received not only was pretty scratched on the bottom, had a huge ding on the corner of the top cover, but the keyboard showed more signs of wear than the MacBook that I've had for 5 years(Space bar was completely warped).  Definitely does not resemble a new device in any way shape or form.  If they are selling used devices, call them used and mark the price down accordingly.  This is definitely going back."
969,"Overall the laptop is nice. A couple of marks on the outside but works relatively well. There was an issue with the battery that originally came with it. It would shut off around 65% battery life. I asked the seller for a replacement battery, which they gave to me free of charge. However, the replacement battery is not originally an Apple battery and instead a knock off. This issue prompted it to restart randomly no matter what the battery life was at. I’m putting the original battery back in and having Apple replace it with the appropriate battery for an additional fee. I got what a paid for and I won’t make the mistake of buying a refurbished Apple product from anywhere other than the Apple store again."
970,This is the BEST purchase I’ve ever made! The laptop 💻 arrived on time and in MINT condition. It functions beautifully and works flawlessly for my personal and business needs. I would recommend this seller to any & all I know who are in the market for reliable and affordable devices.
971,"Battery doesnt work! I travel to another country with the laptop and web I turned on and unplug it, it shuts down! And in Battery Options appears ""Replace now"". How you can help me? I'm in Ecuador now and wont be back in a year!"
972,"I love my new MacBook Air, it came as expected (relatively like new condition). This my first Mac and I’d purchase it again refurbished, you save greatly and get almost the same product 😀"
973,Bought certified refurbished ended up with a unit with a screen covered in dead pixels. I contacted apple to see how much a screen replacement should be more I'm looking a repair cost more than I paid for the laptop.
974,"DO NOT BUY!!! I purchased this computer for about two month and one day I couldn’t turn it on after it goes into sleep mode for a long time. It just wouldn’t turn no matter what I do, I tried every single method out there. I had to press the power button a hundred times for it to finally turn on. But after a while even that won’t work. The computer is just dead. I had to take it to the computer store and they told me it costs $434 to fix it!!!! Even though I actually paid to get it fixed I recommend everyone do not buy!! It’s not worth the money and will cost you more!! The guy in the computer store told me that there is corrosion inside the motherboard and in order to fix it it costs a lot of money ($434). I am truly upset and wished I would have just bought a brand new one from apple that’s the newest version and which will cost me less than what I spent on this computer!!"
975,"The laptop worked great the first week. Eventually, things started to decline and quickly.  I would constantly have to change the time clock, and that would prevent many apps from working properly or not at all. I also discovered that my webcam did not work. I asked customer service if I could get a replacement laptop, and they gave me a website to help me fix it myself. It did not work. Also, the computer would start dying very quickly, even after a full charge. I would also not start up automatically, even with the charger plugged in. I had to press to start button almost endlessly for it to just power on. Eventually, it just would not cut on at all, even with the charger plugged in. It’s completely dead. Apple says that it should cut on with the charger plugged in if it were a battery issue, so it’s definitely something wrong with it beyond that and it will cost upwards of $400 to fix. I’m totally bummed. It did not even last a year."
976,"BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY MOTHER, SHE IS 70 YEARS OLD AND BARELY USES THE LAPTOP.THE SCREEN IS IN THIS STATE, APPEARS TO BE PEELING! VERY BAD!!"

   Note: My purchase was completed through Kanga Supply for this item that ultimately doesn't function as intended.Amazon Renewed item descriptions indicate that the products should work and look like new, which wasn’t the case for this purchase, ergo my poor rating. After only having the Macbook for less than a day, I was forced to reach out to the seller because the product no longer functioned as intended.CONSThe Macbook worked fine for the first hour or so of use, but during an update, the screen flickered vigorously (see video). I hoped it was just a fluke, and it led me to believe there may be some software or hardware-related issue. After having the Macbook for less than 12 hours, I was forced to reach out to the seller because the screen flickering caused the laptop to become unusable (see picture). I also came here to draft a review in hopes that my issue is resolved quickly and effectively. I'll update my review once this is complete.PROSAfter removing the laptop and inspecting the outside, I was pleased. The outside of the Macbook is in good condition, just one or two visible scratches or marks.The charger was not the original Apple charger (as other reviews have indicated) but an OEM adapter. I don’t care that much about whether it’s an Apple charger, as long as it functions.Specs match the advertised item I purchased:128GB SSD8GB ramEDIT/UPDATE: After reaching out to the seller as instructed with the Amazon Renewed products, I never got a response in the allotted timeframe (2 business days) and was forced to reach out to Amazon directly. Ultimately, this item was returned for a refund.UPDATE 2: Today is 1/13/2020 and I have still yet to see this problem resolved to my satisfaction (refund or exchange of working product), after having ordered this product on 12/26/2019. Highly disappointed both in Amazon and the third-party seller.UPDATE 3: Received a replacement Macbook on 1/15/2020. So far it seems to be working, no issues with the screen per the previous item received (was NOT the same item sent back, verified by serial number). Pleased so far with this item."
978,"The 2015 Macbook Pro is still, in my opinion, the best Macbook even in 2019.  I use the SD card reader all the time and have several USB 3.0 devices.  I also use a newer 2017 quad-core i7 for work (no choice) but the difference in speed is not worth the added money and lacking ports.  When I actually put the newer 2017 to work, the heat issue is still a challenge for Apple and performance drops.  It's like having power that I can't actually use unless I sit in a walk-in freezer. Don't quote benchmark speed tests to me, what counts is actual performance sitting at my desk for hours at a time working on a project. I also prefer the magsafe power (although this one uses the magsafe II which I like less than magsafe I which had a more solid connection) This one, I purchased for my wife and it handles everything she needs it to do. Although you can't upgrade the memory on these models, so make sure you get enough for what you need.  If you want to change out memory, then the best choice is the Mid 2012 non-retina model which also come with DVD drives and has USB 3.0 ports."
979,"First off, I am removing a star because they shipped a counterfeit 60W Magsafe 2 charger with my order. I contacted them immediately and they offered to accept a return of everything. I explained that the charger was my only complaint and they overnight FedEx'd a genuine Apple replacement for free.""we sent you the wrong adapter for this batch of order and will overnight you the correct genuine one.""So they knowingly ship counterfeit chargers with some of their orders?The computer is pretty good cosmetically and operationally, but not as great as other reviewers. It is an Early-2015 12,1 model, this one was built in 12/2016. There is a crease over the right USB port from somebody yanking a USB plug. The battery has 107 cycles (89% life left). Keyboard and display are in great shape with no flaws. The SSD has no dead cells. It came with MacOS 10.13 installed.Overall its a good laptop and decent refurbishment job.EDIT: Knocking off another star. They sent me another counterfeit charger. Apple would never loosely jumble the cord in the box, a genuine power supply doesn't stay powered on for several seconds after it's unplugged from the main or stay lit green/orange after its unplugged from the laptop and this fake only puts out 25 watts max."
980,"I really feel like I got a great deal on this, mine arrived in brand new condition and it looked like it had never been used. I did see some people had bad experiences but mine was well worth the price tag. The only negative was that the charger provided is third party and not OEM Apple. The box is also generic and not Apple, not a big deal but you just don't get that same feeling opening it up as a new product. I will say that I checked the serial number on Apple and the computer itself was only a couple of years old, so in reality I paid around $450 for an Apple that was only a couple of years old with a decent amount of battery life still left. I only bought this as there was certain tasks that I could not do on my iPad and so I did not need a brand new super powerful computer. This one is great, does not get hot, fans are silent and the display looks incredible.Overall I was very happy with the purchase, it came fast and was like new condition at the fraction of the cost of a new one. I actually waited a few months before writing this review so that I could also include that I have had no issues at all in that time, battery lasts a decent amount of time and no software or hardware issues to report. It also runs the latest OS that I updated it to and I believe it will be supported software wise for some time to come. Completely worth the price!"

   The Macbook came in working condition with all original components and an OEM charger but not with the extension cord. The major downfall is the condition of the laptop, for the above average asking price for this model I expected great condition as it is stated to be like new but instead the model I received was in okay condition (not cleaned either, large collection of gunk in hinge vent) at best with a lot of edge scratches and deep cuts throughout the chassis, and some unremovable stains from stickers! And worst of all the battery was at over 500 cylces, the battery life was 4-5 hrs max! thats horrible for whats suppose to be a renewed device! Not satisfied!EDIT:  Avoid this entire listing especially from the seller ''Easymobiledevices'', they ship dirty grade b laptop and have poor costumer service."
982,Once i started running it all sort of problems arises. First major problem is wifi drops off and will not let you connect to wifi. After this happens you cant even turn on/off the wifi. Used guest and still no wifi. Restarting or shutdown and restart will not activate wifi. If you restart it takes so long to reboot. Sometimes it get stuck on the waiting wheel on startup. One out of ten restart wifi will work for a minute but then drops off and you will no longer be able to connect again. I cant say anything physically because it looks fine. Lastly beware it shows and says freshly installed mojave os but it has instead sierra installed. The power cord looks like an imitation and not the original one because from the weight it is not the original one. I can tell because i have multiple macbook at home and that is not the original one. I am pretty disappointed with this seller.
983,"I’ll update 15 days from today.CONS:-Delivery packaging: it was a regular box with one thick bubble wrap to protect the laptop.First glance, the charger seems pretty beat up but seems to work fine.-The outer top of the laptop has a lot of scuff marks and scratches. Sides do as well. Nothing TOO severe.-Bottom have some scratches and wearing on the rubber, not too noticeable.PROS:-Had a full battery-Set up went smoothly with no hiccups.-Outer signature glowing Apple works well.-Opening the laptop, the screen has no visible scratches, cracks, or scuffs at all.-Keyboard has no loose keys and is glowing well.-Trackpad has no scratches and works really well no weird working sides SO FAR.-Software automatically updated to Catalina, kinda wanna wait to update to Big Sur.I’ll update March 13, 2021"
984,"Still a GREAT LAPTOP, arguably the best MacBook Pro 13” ever made, 2 or 3 iterations later! I have had mine for 3 months now and although I was a little disappointed that I got a no-brand MagSafe power brick instead of an Apple brand, it’s caused no problems for me. I have been using Logic Pro X a lot and it runs nice and smooth even with the haphazard way I use it, leaving muted unused tracks all over the place as I learn about things like track bouncing and experiment with every single effect and different audio formats (I feel bad sometimes like I am unnecessarily abusing the laptop, lol) and I haven’t frozen or crashed at all. I have used a few emulation programs for old Saturn, Super Famicom, PS and Dreemcast games that push the 2D sprite and parallax scrolling envelope and again I haven’t had any problems. Only thing I have experienced that has been an issue is the actual Mac OS and it’s limitations with regard to formats, programs that it supports and connectivity with outside developers but I have also been able to get around that by setting Virtual Machines up and GUID partitioning to use whatever other OS I need. This is also not a complaint about the hardware itself but rather the Mac OS software so should not be considered when it comes to the actual MacBook Pro 13”.You will want to upgrade to an NVME M2 SSD at least 256 GB or 512 GB right away, as the 128 GB SSD will fill up within 2-3 months of moderate use and the newer M2s will increase the OS loading speed more than anything else. Luckily you have your pick of great SSDs like the Samsung 970 Evo, etc that you can easily swap in with a $5 adapter, a screwdriver and no soldering (just search YouTube for “MB Pro 13 2015 SSD upgrade”)…The unique things and PROS about this MB Pro 13” are the older style KEYBOARD that doesn’t break like 2016-later model keyboards do, 2 USB 3 ports, an SD CARD R/W and a FULL SIZE HDMI PORT all built in. This is the last MB Pro 13 with any of those ports on board and the fact that you can swap SSD hard drives with no soldering and very little skill needed, all-in with the M2 you get a sexy little powerhouse for half the price of the newer model Pro 13”s (1/4 price of current gen)! The rest (CPU, onboard graphics, sound/speakers) make this laptop a must have that will likely only appreciate in value $$$!Two Thunderbolt 2/miniDisplayPorts are useful if you want to setup 2-3 Screens, but the CONS Are that you get NO ThunderBolt 3/USB-C ports and more and more adapters and devices require that connection these days, though with the USB 3 ports there are ways around it, complicated as they may be. You also CANNOT UPGRADE RAM unless you know how to de-solder the current ram and solder up new ram (accepts up to 16GB DDR-3 in 2X8GB formation) and setup the machine to accept the new ram, which seems a recipe to completely destroy the board/laptop without at least some Mac building & Mac hardware programming know-how, possibly even special equipment.MAKE SURE YOU GET THE MODEL WITH THE AMOUNT OF RAM YOU NEED BUILT IN & a CPU that will be sufficient for you and you won’t be disappointed with this awesome little 6 year old laptop! Don’t get the 4 GB model even if it will “work” for you “short-term”! I got the 8GB/i5 2.9Ghz/128GB and I already regret not paying another $100 for the 16GB ram model, but c’est la vie.Just buy this MacBook Pro 13” while you can, replace the SSD as soon as possible, enjoy it, keep it another 5-10 years and you will likely be able to triple your investment by reselling it assuming Apple stays on their current trajectory with their MB Pro Hardware releases!!!"
985,"Hi, I bought this Macbook Pro 13"" early 2015 and received last week on Aug 23th. The laptop has a good appearance and doesn't have any flaws. However, the charger(45w) packed together with the macbook is not for macbook pro but for  Macbook Air. I just found out today, cuz when I use the charger(45w) laptop cpu temperatures goes up to 65-85 celcius. and I can't use more than 4 hours. But when I charge my macbook with Macsafe 1 (85w, which is for Pro), the cpu temperature keeps 40-50 degree, and it runs around 10hours. I want to change my charger into “MacBook Pro Charger 85w”. Thank you."
986,I'm very dissatisfied with this purchase.I can't use the Mac because the hard drive was not reset and the software on the Mac dose not allow you to use it.Also there was no charger.Again very disappointed.
987,"Looks brand new, wrapped and sealed in Apple packaging. Plugged it in and turned it on and let it go. Absolutely no problems, it was automatic and wonderful to have the computer set itself up. Has performed flawlessly as expected of an Apple laptop."
988,"The laptop arrived in fair condition.  The screws show signs of wear so it may have been opened up during the ""renewal"" process.  Old stickers were left on the bottom. Also, the laptop was shipped with a cheap knockoff Chinese charger.  I have no reason to trust this charger so I'll have to order a genuine Apple one instead.Fortunately I don't need this machine to be a workhorse or I would send it back.  This should survive a year at least but I don't trust it as-is - I will wipe the hard disk, NVRAM, and SMC just to be safe."
989,Product was faulty. The charging port wouldn't hold the plug. I returned it. I don't think the refurbishing process is very competent.
990,"This is exactly like the MacBook I was given for work that was stolen on a plane flight. No problems with this as a replacement so far, smooth sailing for 3 months already! I got the protection plan just in case, but I'm very satisfied with this cheaper than new replacement. Will update if there are any issues that arise. Would recommend."
991,"Idk what I was thinking not having an apple in the first place. This laptop is very easy to use, fast, and I’m excited to see how productive I can be with this format. I feel free, nothing holding me back now!! Unlike old pc with unresponsive interface, slow speeds, and constant crashes, this one gives me no problems!!"
992,This laptop was literally like brand new out of the box. So far my daughter is so thrilled with her graduation gift. She is ready for college now!!!
993,"Our first ever Mac but so far its been quite impressive. It was easy to setup and get it going. It works well and very easy to use, turn on/off, carry around and day to day life. Wish the battery would last a bit longer."
994,"BUYER BEWARE!I knew by choosing a refurbished computer, I was taking a risk, but I never expected this. When I received this MacBook Air, I was surprised it was the model Apple stopped making in 2017, since the title said “Newest Version.” I emailed the seller and they said Amazon forced that in the title and told me I could return it. I work full time, am in grad school, and have three kids. I figured with it being an Apple it would last long enough to get me through school, so I kept it. Now, six months later the screen won’t turn on. It’s completely black.I am able to connect to an external monitor and use the computer that way, so I know it’s the display. After trying to adjust the brightness, several resets, resetting the SMC and the PRAM, I called Apple Support. They ruled out all software issues and told me it had to be the hardware.At this point I contacted the seller and they basically told me “sorry, it’s outside of the 90 day window so there’s nothing we will do for you.” I have escalated to Amazon trying to get some kind of resolution. They just confirmed there is nothing they are willing to do for me. They also are not doing anything to penalize the seller, All Out Apple. I'm shocked at Amazon. Shady sellers like All Out Apple will always be around, but I really thought Amazon was better than Ebay in that way. Lesson Learned.There is no reason a MacBook Air should have a display of a completely stops functioning after six months of use, even refurbished. I’m grateful that I had a work-provided monitor I can plug into to do my schoolwork, but if I was aiming to be tethered to my desk, I would have bought a Mac Mini."
995,"Got the computer two days early! this was probably the fastest delivery I've ever received from amazon. I wasn't going to buy refurbished but I really wanted another MacBook and shelling out $2k for a new one was simply out of the question. When I saw the price for this MacBook Air, I decided to roll the dice and buy it. I knew it could possibly come not as advertised, such as having scratches or not being updated as far as software is concerned but when I opened it up it was practically BRAND NEW! set up was simple as can be! only took me 5 minutes to sign in with my Apple ID and all my information was synced between my iPhone and iPad and onto the MacBook Air. There were a few minor scratches less than a couple centimeters on the bottom of the computer nothing that noticeable. the charger doesn't stick as well as I'd like and one of the hinges is half broken off but I've that same issue with practically every MacBook I've ever had. I was really surprised with the quality. it said 2017 version but with all the updates and new iterations its hard to gauge which MacBook your getting I thought I was purchasing a much older MacBook Air than what I got this thing is amazing and the 13 in screen is far larger than I expected it to be feels like a 15 or 17 in display when having it in your hands/ the computer itself is incredibly light, the main reason I chose the air you can carry it in anywhere with one hand and hardly feel it definitely much lighter than my 2020 iPad 11"" All in all if you're on a budget, this computer is the way to go! for $400 its practically brand new and runs like a dream! thanks amazon for this incredible refurbished Mac! love it !"
996,"I don’t what to think I bought 2017 16gb 256 ssd but I received a refurbished 2019 8g 256 perfectly packaged, I can’t put apple care I already call for that but im not sure to keep it because I want a computer of 16of ram but this one is 2019, im gonna give the chance to see how it works, And it cost me the same price of a refurbished 2019 Of apple but those ones you can put apple care"
997,"hola, soy de peru. Estoy contento con la compra, la compre por el precio, y me llego tal cual las especificaciones.(late2018,2.3gz,8ram,256ssd). la bateria llego con 350 ciclos aproxen cuanto a lo estetico, tenia pequeños arañones en un costado, pero nada grave, la pantalla intacta y el touchbar ok. el cargador sellado oem.califico la compra como 9/10."
998,Got a few months out of this before the screen started disappearing intermittently. Then it wasn't so intermittent. I'd have much rather spent the extra money to get a new computer that didn't break than to buy something second-hand and have to decide to repair or replace.
999,"Considering I was 100% ripped off, I would not recommend you purchase from this seller, I did not receive what I wanted, the serial number for a COMPUTER comes up as an iPhone 11... Just.. No."
1000,This computer was working fine and all of a sudden the screen went out.  Cost me $640 to fix it.
1001,"Delivery was super fast, considering I’m in South Africa. The laptop is simply beautiful, woks well, no complaints, I love it."
1002,"Positivo, EXCELENTE EQUIPO!!!"
1003,So far this was a steal. Great product for a great value.
1004,super machine
1005,The space key and some of the keys were not working As they are supposed to. Really sticky
1006,"Arrived, boxed well with balloon cushions. Power adapter looked clean but had scratches. Opened up the Lid of the MacBookPro and it looked like it had some sort of disease or cancer & it smelled quite strange too. It had over 50% battery so I carried on with a reset which resulted in an error. Luckily it booted back into Yosemite OS that it had installed years ago, after 3 failed attempts managed to update to Mojave. Of course first things first copy music etc onto, USB stick struggled to go in either of the USB Ports (look at the photos) was also stuck after insertion but managed to pull out, with a hard pull - full force - anger. Had a look into the ports and discovered they were literally rusted dirty like disgusting, this is not the definition of Refurbished - but 2nd Hand or Heavily Used. Be aware, set your expectations right in oder to avoid any disappointments."
1007,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I was super stoked upon arrival, began setting up the laptop and within minutes the screen stopped working. Literally pixels. Severely disappointed. I have gotten ahold of kanga and they are working to replace the device but it has now been over a week since I’ve purchased the unit with two day shipping and still have nothing to show for it. I hope they come through on their end and send me a functional unit."
1008,"I've only had it for about a week now and this 2015 MacBook Pro is working phenomenally! I was kinda hesitant buying a refurbished MacBook from Amazon, but I can honestly say I'm go glad I went ahead and did. It came extremely fast and right from opening the box, it was as if I had bought a brand new one right from Apple themselves. There's not a scratch, dent, stain, dust or anything on it. So far it's working extremely well and I will definitely buy form this seller in the future and recommend them to others as well! Great price for a great computer."
1009,"I’ve had this MacBook Pro going on 4 days and so far so good! It has met all my expectations and more. I grew up using windows PCs. This is my first Apple computer and I’m happy to have made the transition. Wish I did this long time ago but better late then never. If it wasn’t for the packaging and not being in the original box, I probably wouldn’t be able to tell this was refurbished. This is just based from my experience using MacBooks at the Apple store. Also, there was a few minor scratches on the bottom of the laptop.I will revise and change review in a month if any problems. But as of now, my review above is how I feel."
1010,"I've only had it for a couple days, but so far this is a great purchase. The thing looks brand new, and I know it isn't. I am replacing an older Mac and just can't afford the prices of new machines from Apple. Using Migration Assistant (an app that comes with Macs) I was able to restore a time machine backup from the old machine, so I've lost nothing in the transition."
1011,"When I ordered this product for the first time, it came with a green line on the screen. I contacted the costumer service, they responded very quickly and replaced it.The second computer came with better specs, I was the happiest person... for 2 months though, the computer suddenly stop responding.Other things that are worth saying:- The charger is generic. A generic charger can easily damage the battery of the computer, that could explain my problem.- The second computer they sent, had a sticker that covered the whole low part of the computer (those stickers that are the same color as the computer and are used to cover up very big scratches.Conclusion: they can deliver a great costumer service, but not a working product."
1012,"The macbook pro only worked for a short while. It had a charging/powering problem - wouldn't keep a charge at first, then wouldn't power on even when plugged in. Confirmed it was not a charger issue.I contacted the company who said to send it back for repair. Once they received it they wrote saying it cannot be fixed and charged me a ""restocking fee"" in the amount of the purchase of the laptop. Outrageous!! I even had a protection plan for it. After numerous interactions they refused to help and returned the laptop without telling me. THEN they said they couldn't do anything in terms of a refund because I had the machine. Months later they refuse to resolve it and amazon can't help me because it's a third party seller. An ABSOLUTE JOKE of a company. I'm out over $500.00 with a computer that can't be fixed - and Apple store said they could try but for more than the computer's worth. So yeah. They have my money and I have nothing.DO NOT BUY from these people if you'd like to keep your money."
1013,"Hey all! So I’ve gotten into photography lately and needed a upgrade from my old 2012 MacBook Pro and 2011 Asus laptops for editing. Figured a 2015 model would be the way to go for a decent upgrade without spending tons of money. I was super skeptical about buying a reconditioned one through Amazon after reading the reviews and thought about it for about 4 hours before I made the transaction. Next day it was at my door step with me a bit nervous about opening the package and seeing a beat up MacBook, I opened the box and the MacBook was in a bubble wrapped sleeve and that’s it. Okay I’m fine with that but what was the condition of it? Looks like it barely got used or the previous owner always had a case on it. Outside from a few nicks here and there it’s flawless. Turns on and is super quick, the Retina display is beautiful and definitely enjoyable to watch movies. It came with Mojave so the first thing I did was update it to Big Sur and it’s still flawless. I’ve only had it for a day if that but so far I’m happy with my purchase. Just be mindful yours may or may not be like mine condition wise I got lucky. Should you buy one of these? I would I’m pleased with my purchase and I’m sure you would be too. But I’ll update with any issues if they come up in the future. Thankfully I’m a bit tech savvy so whatever happens I’m sure I can fix it."
1014,"This of course this is an old model and reconditioned/renewed, so I was expecting it to look somewhat used; however, this MacBook Pro is in PERFECT CONDITION as if I had purchased it new. I'm upgrading from a very heavy and slow 2009 white MacBook that's a dinosaur and I could only do very basic things on it. It has almost zero capability in terms of battery life (it could only be used plugged in) so this laptop is an absolute gem in comparison. This might be why I'm so hyped and elated. Plus the price was very good. *I hope the computer doesn't have some sudden glitch and dies on me...lol!Now, I can finally edit my videos in iMovie, which was not working on the old MacBook, because I couldn't update it anymore. I need this laptop mainly for traveling, to do editing work, I have a 2 monitor PC set-up at home. My only wish is that I could transfer my Adobe CS to the new laptop.SIDE NOTE: it's actually overall a little smaller than my old 13"" (screen size is the same), it's not as heavy, but not as light as the Air; it arrived with Catalina iOS installed and I had to upgrade to Monterey to use the newest version of iMovie - this isn't a complaint, just an observation."
1015,"I bought for my mom, great deal (sort-of), works great (after I deleted 2 mysterious old unknown wifi connections)I bought this for my mom, she was always having Windows problems, viruses disguised as virus removal, scammy pop-ups, and so on.  Happy day!  :DThey raised prices during Prime Day, wth?  I thought I was getting a good deal, but afterward I noticed the price went down.  Anyway, I ordered this for my mom.  She's been using Windows and I wanted her to experience a Macbook Pro.  This one is actually even better than mine!  I'm still happily using a Late 2013 2.4 Ghz 8 RAM 256 GB 13-inch Retina, her's is exactly the same except it's a Early 2015 and it's actually got 2.7 Ghz!  Anyway she seems really happy with it.  I set it up for her, and ran the serial number, which was not found, not surprisingly although I'm not sure what that means, and the update page in the App Store looks like it was coded in 1995, so I'm not sure what's up with that.  Could be something funky going on, but all I know is it works and we're happy with it.  She's getting used to using it, and she says it's fast and smooth.  She was getting tired of all the Windows updates and virus stuff and all the spammy popups telling her to purchase a virus disguised as virus removal, yadda yadda yadda, so I am well-pleased that she is now almost a full-blown Mac-head.  Thanks Apple.  I hope to be able to afford an Apple car when they do come out, haha.  I'm not sure about the battery-life yet, but I HAD TO replace the battery on mine, so replacing it on hers should not be a problem."
1016,It’s just one continuous problem after the other with this computer. It’s really not worth it to save a little bit of money just buy new not refurbished have your warrantee you’re better off in the long run.
1017,For this being my first ever Mac- This was an amazing buy... no scratches or dents. Its basically BRAND NEW. 😝😝😝The only thing is that it says 512gb but the space says 256gb so be wary of that.But other than that I am really happy with my purchase.
1018,Good
1019,Love it
1020,"the product arrived with the screen broken. I would like a refund of $ 400 to repair it, since he is now in Brazil."
1021,So happy with this purchase. Even my kids said it looks like the new ones. Has some minor imperfections but at the cost totally acceptable. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.
1022,"I purchased through amazon this m1 chip 512 gb 8ram macbook pro 2020 year manufacture.  I’m a mac user of many years.  The computer is blazing fast, slim, light with great battery life. A huge bonus—-little need for additional  anti virus add on software since the macbook anti virus platform is very solid. A hidden gem when you buy any apple device is phenomenal tech telephone support.  The advisors at the apple stores and by telephone are the best part of the apple experience for me and even rival the devices they sell. Yes, I hate the high prices and know the game but over time I’ve  accepted their price points because of the incredible tech support."
1023,battery would not take any charge  stuck at 1%
1024,"I cannot believe the condition my Macbook is in, you can’t even tell if it’s used and the packaging was very nice and professional with the white box and wrapped just like it is when you get it directly from Apple. I am super happy with my purchase, thanks Amazon."
1025,"Good, but it is a little small.. easy to control. Recommend if you are hard to control your computer"
1026,Computer will not charge.
1027,"""Refurbished"" even though Battery life was non existent from the startup, always check the reviews on laptops to make sure they have over 200, cause then you won't be played by greedy ass people like I was"
1028,"Minor scratches , for the price reduction is a great buy !!!"
1029,Light weight
1030,"El producto reacibdiocionado en muy buen estado, funciona perfectamente y venía totalmente protegido y embalado. Muy satisfecho con la compra"
1031,"Looks and acts brand new. Everything exactly as advertised. Will update if I have any issues but after a week I can say, I am pleasantly surprised!"
1032,"This is an unusually large advance over previous models, especially in raw computing power, but also in fun things like screen and headphone support.This Amazon listing has two different processors, the M1 Pro (listed as 16-Core GPU ""style"") and the M1 Max (32-Core GPU). I'll call one the Pro, the other the Max. I got the base Pro, but much of what I'll say applies to both, and I'll have some comments specifically about the Max too. (MBP below = MacBook Pro.)Amazon doesn't offer most of the options you can get, only the ones listed. For now (and probably later), that's the Pro with 16GB RAM and 512GB or 1TB SSD, or the Max with 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD. 3 versions total.Screen Brightness* and HappinessThis screen can get up to 1600 nits brightness and can sustain full-screen brightness up to 1000. That's very impressive, as MBPs since 2016 have topped out at 500.*But the vast majority of the time, this screen will also top out at 500, because those other numbers are only for HDR (high dynamic range, what Apple calls XDR), i.e. some videos and some photos viewed in some programs. If you're browsing the internet, using productivity apps, or the like, those are almost all SDR (standard dynamic range). You'll be seeing them at the same brightness as with MBPs for the last five years.That said, the new screen is beautiful and bright in both HDR and SDR for most situations. For HDR, it puts out more color and brightness, and darker blacks - a million-to-one contrast ratio - with a wider range of light and color that has more pop and more detail in shadows and highlights. It can be dazzling or just more realistic.For SDR, it's much like before, still a gorgeous screen, with better contrast than before because of darker blacks.Has more pixels per inch (254, up from 226), and more pixels all over (3456 by 2234, up from 3072 by 1920). The aspect ratio remains 16:10 (not counting the top menu bar).ProMotionProMotion is Apple's name for screen refresh rates that can go up to 120Hz, or lower to save processor/battery power when 120 isn't needed. This makes motion smoother, more natural.For now where ProMotion applies is limited. Most scrolling in browsing, including with Safari, still tops out at 60Hz. Which is fine for me, but it bothers some people, looks choppy to them. This could be changed with a software update.Bloom and GhostsBloom is when a bright spot on a dark background bleeds out past where it's supposed to be, a common issue with this kind of screen. I and most others think this screen handles it well (better than the iPad Pro), but it can still arise some.Ghosting is when a moving object leaves a noticeable trail of ghost images behind for a fraction of a second, one for each new frame until the old image fades. MBPs are notoriously mediocre at this kind of ghostbusting, and this screen is no exception. Expect the usual haunting, if you notice that kind of thing.PWMFor those concerned (you mostly know who you are), there is PWM (pulse-width modulation) on the smaller 14"" version of this screen, and so very likely on this one too, at a frequency of 14,880Hz at all brightness levels (measured by NotebookCheck). That's a very high frequency, considered well beyond what would cause trouble for the susceptible.The NotchAs you can see in the main photo here, there's a black Notch at the top of the screen. There are no pixels there. The long-desired improved camera is there, and a mic array and light sensor (and maybe room for a Face ID system if they decide to make MBPs with that). As with the iPhone Notch, it's controversial.You can make the Notch disappear, or rather blend in, if you make the background up there black. It also disappears into the black bars when you view things like videos in full-screen mode.The cursor disappears into the Notch if you put it there. If an app has menu items that stretch there, they disappear too, but they'll still function normally if you put the (invisible) cursor on them.Desperate times call for desperate measures. Most apps won't have this trouble, but if you must, you can avoid menu items disappearing by using the ""Scale to fit"" function, which shrinks the entire screen work area a little to fit below the Notch. Makes it look like an old 15"" if the background is black, like there are wide black bezels. (Google ""Scale to fit below built-in camera"" for full instructions and mockery.)There are also third-party apps, such as Bartender, to manage how items appear in the menu bar and keep them visible.Camera and MicsThe new camera that, along with the thinner bezels, makes the Notch necessary, is 1080p, with an f/2 lens for good exposure in the shadows. Video looks noticeably better than before, though it can have a processed look.The three mics sound very clean and natural but with a little less bass than before to my ears, which is fine.Extra ScreensYou can use two external monitors with the Pro, down from four with previous models. They can be up to 6K @60Hz with a billion colors. The Max can still use four: three 6K and one 4K, all @60Hz etc.You can use 4K @120/144Hz HDR monitors too.You can run two from one port if you use the right kind of dock or daisy-chain.Headphone OomphThe new headphone jack has more power for high-impedance headphones. It automatically adjusts, so it won't overwhelm low-impedance phones. If the headphones have less than 150 ohms impedance, they get 1.25 volts RMS. If more, 3 volts. That might cause it to fail to provide enough power to some not-so-high-impedance headphones that still require extra power, such as planars.With my 2016 15"" MBP, I've had to use a portable amp for my Beyerdynamic DT 1990 Pros (250 ohm), but now I can pretty well do without it, though sometimes only just. The volume on some sources is still not always what I wish I could make it. But now I can nearly achieve hearing loss with the intro to the guitar riff in ""Money for Nothing."" Which also sounds good, and healthier, a couple notches down.Among other headphones that have tested favorably with the new jack are the DT 990 Pros (250 ohm), and the Sennheiser HD650, 660S, 6XX, and HD800 (150 to 300 ohm).One report says the planar Hifiman HE4XXs (35 ohm planar) sound good, but most planars tested are said to need more power. The Audeze LCD-2Cs are reported to sound good enough, though not their best. The LCD-3s and Hifiman Sundaras and Aryas are said to be underpowered.For my usual regular-impedance phones, Cleer Flow IIs (16 ohm), the wired volume is a little louder than before, though still not always the earsplitting barrage I want for some sources. Maybe for the best.Quality iems (in-ear monitors) that require especially clean input, but not too much, reportedly sound good, including Andromedas and Moondrop Starfields.SpeakersThey're improved from the already laptop-leading speakers from earlier MBPs, with a fuller sound and decent kick, amazingly good for when nothing with a 3"" woofer is around.Apple mysteriously says the 14"" M1 has the same speaker system, but looking inside both machines shows the speakers in the 16"" are bigger - both ""subs"" and tweeters - and located differently, with the subs in the front corners on this one. The 16"" has fuller bass (such as it is).Heat and NoiseThere isn't any.None with my typical use, at least. If you push it hard, it can get warm, but not as hot as my 2016 15"". Which makes sense, as this has a larger enclosure, bigger fans, larger, better heat sinks, and more power-efficient processors. The fans don't have to spin up as much to do the same amount of cooling, so it's noticeably quieter even when it does heat up, rarely makes any noise at all.The 16"" Max comes with a larger heat sink than the 16"" Pro, so likely runs a little cooler and quieter sometimes, though the Max might get hotter when it uses a lot of that extra power.KeyboardVery quiet, much like the older Mac laptop keyboards, not the butterfly ones from 2015-19, but the rest. Maybe less travel in the keys than some of those, but plenty for me.I miss the touch bar sliders for fine control of some functions, but you can still use sliders via the Control Center, the icon next to the date on the screen's top menu bar. That's also where control of the keyboard backlight is, no more control for it on the keyboard.TouchpadThe best available by far, responsive and large so you can carry the cursor over a large area with more control. For clicks, it's great. For taps, which I turn off, it's not as great, according to those who prefer that - appears to be a software issue.PortsThere's one less Thunderbolt/USB-C port than before, but 50% more bandwidth (3 controllers instead of 2).The HDMI is 2.0, can drive up to 4K HDR @60Hz.The SD card reader is shallow, so the cards stick out. There might be room for a flush micro-SD adapter. I only have cards up to 64GB, which work fine. Some people have had trouble reading some cards, so it may be finicky.Battery LifeI usually keep plugged in, but the reviews I've seen that cover battery life tests typically say it's the longest of any similar machine they've tested, including PCs. Reports of battery life for office work, browsing, watching videos, and so on generally range from 10 to 16 hours, sometimes more. It can go unusually long with heavy use too, 5 hours or more of video work, for example. Max Tech did 10 benchmark and stress tests with it in a couple hours, some maxing out the CPU or GPU for up to ten minutes, and it still had 36% left.At normal settings, there's no performance hit until you get down to 3%; until then you can process or game at full tilt. There's a low-power mode that extends battery life by limiting performance, lowering screen brightness, etc. The Max also has a high-power mode, but it seems to only ramp up the fans sooner to help cooling. Apple's description and tests in reviews indicate it doesn't affect performance in any direct way.The Max has tended to have a little less battery life than the Pro in reviews. The only good tests I've seen that compared directly either found negligible differences or up to 15% less battery life for the Max. (Other tests haven't been well controlled.)You can quick charge to 50% in a half-hour. The new power brick is 45% more powerful than before, and maybe 30% larger lengthwise, still small for what it does. You can charge at lower speed with smaller bricks (not included) via the USB-C ports.Size and WeightIt's noticeably heavier than before, about 5 ounces over the previous 16"", and not quite as sleek, but it's sleeker than I was expecting from the photos.RepairabilityHa ha! But really, it's better than it was. Battery modules now have pull tabs so they can be more easily replaced. The screen can be replaced more easily, but if Apple doesn't do it you lose True Tone (which I don't want anyway). The headphone, Thunderbolt and MagSafe ports can be replaced without replacing the logic board. Now rates a 4/10 from iFixit for repairability, up from 1/10 for the previous model.CompatibilityComes with Rosetta 2, which enables M1 Macs to use programs written for Intel Macs, and usually works very well.There's no more Boot Camp, so to run Windows or Windows programs you have to use third-party software like Parallels, which runs Windows by emulating a Windows machine (and requires a Windows license), or Crossover, which modifies Windows programs to run on Macs.  Which works best, or at all, depends on the program.GamingWoW *mostly* runs 50 to 120fps at high settings and resolution, depending on the location. Some places can't even manage 50 at those settings, though, but do OK at more compromised settings. Baldur's Gate 3, Diablo III, CS:GO and several others can run at 60-100fps or better at good settings.You can play Windows games via Parallels or Crossover. They generally don't run as well, but some do fine.Most games, including native ones, run quite a bit better on the Max, with up to 2x the fps. Final Fantasy XIV is hit and miss at good settings even with the Max.Gaming isn't usually hot or noisy, can get warmer with light fans for the games that aren't running natively. And there's no noticeable performance hit for gaming on battery.WorkI have to mention the less fun part: how well this does things you might have to do at work. It does almost all of it better than before, much of it way better. Here's how it compares according to actual test results from numerous sources with Xcode, Logic Pro, Lightroom, Blender, Final Cut Pro, Premiere Pro, and so on. The range of comparison depends on what the task is.Previous base MBP 16"" (Intel i7 AMD 5300): The Pro is 60% to several times faster.Previous top-spec'd MBP (i9 5600M): The Pro is about the same to 2 or 3 times faster.Regular M1 machines (not M1 Pro or Max): The Pro is about the same to several times faster.The 14"" M1 Pro with same specs: The same, though the 16"" has the bigger battery and heat removal system, so it fares better in those ways.Windows laptop work stations: This is complicated, but the Pro can thrash most Windows laptops in most intensive work-related apps. It lines up very roughly with machines with a good i7/i9 and an RTX 3070, but generally can't keep up with the RTX 3080. The Pro uses a fraction of the power, and so only produces a fraction of the heat and noise, if any. And lasts and performs much better on battery.Pro vs MaxThe Max is about the same to twice as fast as the Pro, mostly between those extremes. The CPU is much the same, but the GPU is double the cores, so the main advantage is in graphics-heavy work.Besides the GPU cores, the Max has twice the bandwidth for memory transfer, two hardware video encode engines instead of one, and some extra cooling capacity.If you're already successfully using a Mac laptop, you don't *need* the Max, since the Pro is already better than what you have. But that doesn't mean you can't benefit from the Max's extra power if you have the money. For intensive video editing, massive photo editing, or better gaming (though cheaper Windows machines will play most games better), the Max has real advantages.To confuse things a little more, Apple (but not Amazon currently) also offers a demi-Max with a 24-core GPU, halfway between the Pro's 16 and the Max's 32. It's a cheaper way to get the extra bandwidth, video encoder, and cooling advantages of the Max. Tests show that in graphics-intensive tasks it operates roughly midway between the Pro and 32-core Max, often more than half, as expected.WarrantiesThis comes with a one-year limited warranty against manufacturing defects that includes free phone support for the first 90 days. If you want to also cover accidental damage (with deductibles) and extend the regular warranty and free tech support to 3 years, you can buy 

AppleCare+ from Amazon

   (link embedded) or Apple. You get 60 days from purchase to buy it, but coverage for accidents doesn't start until you do. (I always self-insure when I can, so I didn't get it.)DecalsLast and least, this comes with two black Apple decals, the sign of true professional Apple equipment."
1033,Out of the box unusable for me. This MacBook Pro does not have any USB ports to be able to restore from a previous Mac back up that’s on an external drive. You must buy an adapter. Since I live in a remote area I’d have to order online and wait. You cannot even plug a iPhone12 Pro Max directly into it. The only ports it has are thunderbolt. So even Apple’s own lighting connector needs an adapter. The keyboard is a downgrade from the old keyboard. Solid black plastic instead of plastic keys surrounded by aluminum which were easier to see. Had to call Apple support to download an update because there is no reset option in the System Preferences of OS Monterey. And the update did not work to give it that option. Will have to figure out a different option to remove my account and information to return it. This particular MacBook is defective I believe.
1034,I ordered the 2021 16 inch right away as I knew they would probably sell out fast. I had to make sure I had one for my trip I am leaving on soon.  As soon as I opened it the screen would never come on.  Thought maybe it needed charging so I tried that.  Still nothing but a black screen.  It kept making the sound when you open it up even when it was closed over and over again.  I took it to the local Apple Store hoping I could get some answers.  They tired to get it to work and could not either.  They said it is very strange and maybe something happened to it during shipping.  They said since it is brand new it would be best to get my money back from Amazon.  I thought maybe I could just exchange it before my trip but the one I ordered is out of stock.  I will try the 14 inch and see if I like it compared to the size of the 16 inch since it is in stock.  This is a first MacBook Pro I have ever purchased and now I am a bit nervous.
1035,"Here are the temperature results for the new cool MacBooks compared to the old overheating intel ones. 91 degrees for the old one near the processor, and 74 degrees on the new ones. Both had been running for hours transferring files nonstop. Amazing. I have been editing video, transferring large files and not once have the fans kicked on. Makes me want to cry."
1036,"Finally, this 2021 MacBook Pro cured my depression!"
1037,Arrived DOA - wouldn’t start up. Spent hours on the phone with Apple support and still wouldn’t start. Returned - c’mon man!
1038,"This laptop is unbelievably fast. Between the screen, battery life, and performance, this laptop is head and shoulders better than any competition."
1039,My first ever MacBook. Switched over from PC and I can't believe I didn't switch sooner! On the pricer side but I'm super happy with my purchase!
1040,"I have been using my MacBook Pro from 2014 for work until last week when I finally purchased this MacBook Pro. My old MacBook starts up and works as fast as the day I bought it. The only reason I bought a new MacBook was because the battery life was getting low. I probably could have just bought a new battery and it would have been fine.That being said, I did hold out for this MacBook because Apple brought back the ports that I needed. I use the HDMI and SD ports daily. An Ethernet port would have been nice but that’s asking too much. This MacBook has a 2 day battery life and is blazing fast. I use Adobe programs and this MacBook doesn’t even blink when I do live editing. Best laptop I have ever used.I own a business that uses many PC laptops and a couple MacBooks. A PC will never last as long as a MacBook. And, a PC ALWAYS gets slower after 6 months of use. The price is high but you can buy a new PC every 2 years or a MacBook every 7 years."
1041,"Coming from a 2019 16in, I feel that this generation is 2 steps forwards, 1 step back.Pros:-Fans are never audible even under full extended load!  This was my #1 issue with my 2019 mac which would have constant fan noise with 2 monitors.-2x battery life-Better screen especially in dark environment or a dark subject-Extremely fast for certain workloads such as video editing and code compilation.-magsafe is back (although I personally don't care for it)-most apps work normally with rosetta emulation, but may have some stutter.Cons:-thicker and SIGNIFICANTLY heavier.-Screen has a notch which is very distracting for me.-Still has some compatibility issues.-Terrible for games.  Only a few titles are supported natively.  I only tested league of legends(uses rosetta emulator), but it was choppy and 1/3 the fps of my 2019 intel macbook.- +$300 base price even though they got rid of intel.-The area I feel apple has made a major misstep is with ports.  I couldn't care less for SD card or HDMI, but everyone who buys this is going to need USB-A.  It's ridiculous that I still have to bring a dongle everywhere just to use my mouse but these ports I never/rarely use are back.Also some developer related tools/libraries aren't working.C# debugger is totally unsupported for example.  Anything that requires gpu hardware acceleration (pytorch) is unlikely to ever be supported in any usable form.  Linux dual boot is unsupported or in early experimental stages.  I also had issues building/running java projects natively, but no issues with rosetta.If you're looking to buy this for an undergrad program, it's probably workable.  However, I'd suggest saving some $ and getting a used mac or windows machine.  Professional devs will be aware of their specific requirements, but I suspect many will need to keep a secondary x86 machine for the foreseeable future."
1042,"I am writing this review focused primarily on people who are considering jumping from the 13"" MacBook Pro to the 14"" MacBook Pro, which is what I did. I moved from the 13"" MacBook Pro M1 with 16gb of RAM to the 14"" MacBook Pro M1 Pro with 16gb of RAM.Size: So, 1"" of screen might not seem like a lot on its face, but the difference is pretty substantial, in my opinion. Even the pictures don't quite do it justice. The screen feels considerably larger in a package that isn't considerably larger. For me, it's the perfect sweet spot for someone who wants something larger than the 13"" model, but smaller than the 16"". I had a 16"" MacBook Pro i9 and it was just too much for me. This one feels perfect.Form Factor: The new 14"" and 16"" MacBooks both adopt a thicker chassis, which is shown in the pictures. As such, Apple decided to make the casing flat instead of gently rounded. It honestly reminds me of the pre-unibody builds, but still sleek and modern. If I didn't know this one was new and you just laid them side-by-side, I might say that the old form factor looks a little newer, but that isn't to say that it looks bad.Aesthetics: Overall, I touched on the aesthetics a bit in the ""form factor"" section. It looks like a high-end laptop, but at the same time I can see some people thinking it looks dated. I personally like the flatter look over the more rounded look, but it will depend on the person. Another thing I like is moving the ""MacBook Pro"" branding from under the screen to the bottom of the casing. I just think it provides a cleaner look during use. The black background of the keyboard is also a plus for me. The old space gray background was fine, but I really like the black.Function: Most people probably won't notice a massive difference in the previous iteration and the new iteration. For the 14"" and 16"" MacBook Pros, the touchbar has been removed. This will make a lot of people happy. For me, I was always pretty ambivalent about the touchbar, but I'm not going to complain about a key row there. The keyboard appears to have ever so slightly more travel and bounce. It's not a huge amount, but it is noticeable. I'll touch on The Notch later.Performance: My 13"" had the M1 chip and now my 14"" as the M1 Pro. So far, I haven't noticed a tremendous difference when using programs like Logic Pro, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Lightroom, but I wouldn't say those are super intensive programs. If you're exporting massive 8K videos, you might want to jump up to the M1 Max. One thing I have noticed is that the thermals are maybe a little bit worse. Just a touch. I have noticed it warming up a bit, but the fan still has not come on once. I only mention this because my 13"" M1 stayed cold at all times. It's not as bad as my i9, which sounded like a jet engine revving up while it jumped well over 100 degrees, but it's something to be aware of.The Notch: Honestly, so much has been made of the notch and I think it's mostly overstated. Yes, it's fun to meme the fact that Apple still hasn't found a way around the notch, particularly on iPhones, but it's really not a huge deal. Were it up to me, I would have just left a bezel up there, but I can understand why Apple didn't. I use a Dell XPS for work and it has razor thin bezels with no notch, but at the same time the camera is an absolute joke. Looks like it's from 2002.The Notch (cont'd): The notch behavior can be inconsistent from app to app, but not to the point where it's bothersome. I have seen some programs with very large nav menus up top bump the status bar out of the way to make room. And while this particular phenomenon is not something new for MacBooks, losing a big chunk of that bar to the notch will likely make this a more regular occurrence for people. Do I wish it didn't have a notch? Yeah, probably. Does it hurt the experience? Very, very little.Screen: For everyday indoor use, which is almost exclusively what I do, I think you will be hard-pressed to find a better screen on the market. The 120Hz refresh rate is something I waited a long time to get on the iPhone, so I was pretty shocked to see it implemented on the new MacBook Pros just a month later. It actually has more pixels/inch than the iMac 27"" 5K screen, which I also use pretty regularly. All-in-all, the screen is just the best in the business.Overall: It's a great and powerful laptop for someone who is wanting a little more than web surfing and word processing. I use mine primarily for recording music, as well as live performances using standalone plugins, so I need something that is powerful and easy to use. The MacBook Pro has always fit the bill, but now with the M1, M1 Pro, and M1 Max chips, I have absolutely no concern for performance or consistency.My 13"" M1 did just what I needed in this regard, but I'm someone who wanted a slightly larger screen without drastically increasing my footprint and weight. The 14"" MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip is just what I needed. If you're someone who needs absolutely top notch performance, I'd recommend upgrading the RAM and going with the M1 Max."
1043,"I haven't upgraded my computer for more than a decade, so it would stand to reason any recent releases would impress me, but this macbook pro has gone above and beyond in the small time I've had it.The screen is truly something to behold. Smooth, clear, just beautiful. I don't typically care about bezels, but I might start. The expanded screen makes an unexpected difference. Meanwhile, I barely notice the notch. Apple said they'd find workarounds to make it scarce, and they have.The speakers are wonderful as well. I was skeptical at first -- thought I caught some tinny effects on a couple songs, but the more I listen to them, the more I'm convinced the tinniness was in the recording (it was a live album, which might explain it). As for the spatial audio, I've only heard a couple songs, but it's pretty trippy. This is my first experience with it, and it doesn't disappoint.In the short time I've had the computer, it's been nothing but fast. Probably more computer than I need, so if you're a sound editor or photographer, this review probably isn't for you. But for those of you casual users who want a solid machine that will last (as I said, my last macbook pro made it more than a decade), this is the one. Excited as I was for my last macbook, I could see room for improvement at the time. Right now, I don't see how things get better than this."
1044,"M1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. Compared to previous MacBook Pro, it's a giant leap ahead. These tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the Macbook. This particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro,  but it still kicks butt. You can get the Pro Max chip and bump up the RAM to 64GB if you want - and add tons more storage. The 14 inch MacBook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. It can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. The display is stunning. Just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. The brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. Real HDR viewing -  a big difference. You will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. After 10 minutes I don't even notice it. It means nothing for your experience. Its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. Camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous MacBooks. Six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. Music/movies it feels like surround sound. For video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. The keyboard is a dream to type on. Very solid like all MacBooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. The Apple Magic Keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. Battery life is amazing. I have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. At best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! Especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it won't be 17 hours but I did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. The power efficiency is ground breaking. They have added back the MagSafe power plug - which is great! And added back an SD card slot and and an HDMI port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. I wish it had at least one USB-A old style port - but it doesn't. You get three USB-C thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. They got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro MacBooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. Apparently they listened to a lot of users who didn't really like the touch pad. The shape and style of this laptop is great. Some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. That is BS. I have been typing most of the day and I don't feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. Very comfy for typing. Some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new Macbook Pro, but I am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside -  this is an amazing laptop - the best Apple has ever made, hands down. And I would say you won't find a better power laptop anywhere.  All that said - this is not a gamers machine. Apple is not for hard core gamers. I mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. I am a hard core gamer and a PC geek  - I have a powerful windows PC for gaming. And always will. But for everything else. this MacBook is king. I use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. I can plut into a giant monitor if I want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch IPS panel. So if you are wondering if this Macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - I am here to tell you, its the real deal. I finally upgraded from my 2015 MacBook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. If you are thinking of getting one - you won't be disappointed. One last comment. I am an old timer windows guy, and I know all the counter arguments for the Mac. Many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. First, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new M1 Pro chips - you can't. And aside from that, the Mac OS is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text FROM A PHOTO! Whaaat? And the design/ergonomics/quality of these MacBooks is unmatched. So, yes you pay more - but you get more. My last MacBook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. If you want this laptop - get it! It rocks."
1045,"I have a Mabook Pro covered by Apple care. The computer needs a new battery. To make a long story short Apple left me for months with a computer, again under warranty, which I can use for a couple of hours for simple tasks like web browsing before it needs to be recharged. Apple refused to replace the battery because the diagnostic read 81% not below 80 % as per policy. In all this Apple didn’t have any problems asking me to invest countless hours of my time between doing clean installs trips to apple stores etc.. I feel a more respectful way to treat me as a loyal customer could have been let us replace the battery first and if that doesn’t fix the issue which I seriously doubt ask me to do troubleshooting. All this to save something that would probably cost you few $$. Seriously ?"
1046,sent me base model
1047,"I probably got a faulty laptop but the charger status doesn’t show it’s charging when plugged in, only thing indicating that it’s charging is the orange light. My chrome windows keeps crashing whenever I put the computer to sleep and the external video display rarely connects"
1048,"I never write reviews, but feel compelled to write one for this Macbook Pro. I've owned macs consistently since 1990s and have dealt with eye strain on the air and now on this laptop. It gave me horrible headaches and eye strain even with a matte protector. I returned it and am now looking at PCs for the first time because if I can't read from the screen without it making me sick, I can't use it."
1049,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   My first MacBook ever! I had been saving up for it before the official drop— & I was not disappointed! Love the Touch ID feature, and it’s so efficient! Can’t wait to use it when I go back to school!"
1050,"This laptop has a superior display, superior speakers, superior camera and an excellent keyboard. Don't go cheap and buy the ""affordable"" MacBook Air base model like some of these talking heads have been advising. It's not a good buy if you are unhappy with it after six months, and believe me, you will be unhappy with 8 GB of RAM and two USB ports after six months. M1 MacBooks are not upgradeable so if you find that you need more RAM, you are stuck. Unless all you are doing sending emails, tweets, and watching TicTok, you will probably need something more, especially if you are using your laptop for work. I'm using my MacBook Pro with an LG UltraFine 5K 27 inch display as my desktop system, which replaces a 27 inch iMac. I'm very happy."
1051,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Sheeeese! What can I say? Apple has done it again 🤪😍 magnificent piece of device I must say."
1052,"I pulled the trigger on this thing hoping that the bad reviews were wrong.. some of the comments saying it came dirty and defective definitely gave me pause however, what arrived today was practically a brand new macbook. the device does not show any signs of wear and the battery cycle count is 18, it came with the original power brick and while the cable was used, it was not worn or dirty in any way. While i've only just started using the device about an hour ago, I can tell you that it's speedy and works flawlessly... had I not known it was a refurb when buying it, I would have easily confused it for a brand new mbp.. for those asking, this is a 2017 macbook pro and the specs as quoted are accurate. i'll play around with this thing for a little while and update this review as needed, but so far this looks like a winner!***update***A few months in and it’s still working flawlessly. I don’t regret my purchase for one second, and neither should you!"
1053,This is not a 256GB MacBook Pro- they are falsely advertising it as such and then shipping buyers 128GB versions.
1054,"Came in used and dirty, and it was not even turn off, I'm gonna return it. So disappointed."
1055,"Wow. I cant say enough how happy I am with this laptop! I it arrived early, and for a refurbished computer I swear it doesn't have a scratch, dent, smudge or single flaw anywhere on it! Its fast, the battery is great, its working perfectly! I couldn't be happier with this thing!"
1056,"Was excited to receive it and on the outside it had one noticable chip in the case on the cover side (which had a sharp edge to it), but thought that isn't too bad.  But when opening it up the screen in both the top left and top right were broken/chipped/cracked like it had been dropped and they replaced the cover, but not the screen.  This was not acceptable.  Wanted to try it out and ended up learning that some of the keys did not work right (sticky, pushed strange and such), plus the touchpad/mouse was really strange and didn't seem to work correctly.  Too many issues out of the box for me and too concerned that there might be other issues from where it looked to have been dropped and such.  Sending it back and just started that process.  So far the return seems ok....but just hate that the product does not match the description...using their words ""Renewed products work and look like new""."
1057,"I ordered the space gray with 256 gb of ram and received a silver with 128gb.  I knew this could happen as the picture did not match the description and I had seen other similar reviews.The good news is it was on time and in flawless condition.  I think I will stick with it and not press my luck, as it is still a fair price and a great machine, but beware."
1058,"I have to admit, I don't typically write reviews and I was a little hesistant about the product due to some 1 to two star reviews. The space gray model not only is at a great price, it came to me brand new. With all the specs I was expecting, i5 8GB RAM 256GB SSD, and works like a dream. Battery life is great, setting up was easy, and all my Apple Products (iPhone, Apple watch, Earpods) synced with no issues. I'm not sure as to why there were so many negative reviews, but mine is not one of them. SO HAPPY!! I truly recommend."
1059,the battery is dead
1060,"This product arrived quickly and looked great.  There have been multiple glitches with the power switch and with the screen ever since it's arrival.  Most of the time the power button would require multiple attempts to push before the computer would power up.  When the computer woke from sleep state (opening lid after its been closed for at least fifteen minutes) the screen would be black and then all pixelated.  Most recently, the computer wouldn't even turn on, when it finally did, it was all reset and all the settings were reset.  I lost everything I had put on the computer over the past day.  The seller still hasn't gotten back to me after email and I left a voice message.  I have now initiated a return as I want my money back.  It would have been nice if they had gotten back to me ASAP when I emailed or when I called (during normal hours of operation, by the way) and it went to voicemail.  The fact that they didn't and the computer kept coming up with other issues.  I now will buy a new one.  The value is not there with the aggravation generated."
1061,"Multiple reviews mentioned getting devices with used batteries, screen issues, etc.My laptop arrived through FedEx Express with questionable packaging. But everything was intact and fine. The laptop still had the plastic wrapped around it as MacBooks directly from Apple do, even with the screen cover. Only 3 battery cycles out of the box, with a new charger in the box. I am very satisfied with the purchase although in the Q&A section of this product someone mentions that this is a 2018 model, its not, its a 2017 (At least the one I received.) which for me isn't really a big deal since it arrived in exceptional condition. Highly recommend this MacBook."
1062,I'm a fan of apple products and I like almost everything about this new MBA. But it has one huge flaw that nobody talks about. It's the camera hardware and it hasn't been updated in ages. My zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light. A $1000 laptop with 10 year old front camera is unacceptable. Camera is very important to me. Especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time.
1063,"Liked:- Long battery life (one charge WILL last all day, i.e. 16 hours. Personally tested true)- Speed (the new M1 processor really is fast)- Quiet (no fan but the laptop still does not get hot)- Light and portable- High resolution & bright displayDisliked:- As with other MacBooks, the keyboard is mediocre especially compared to laptops like Lenovo Thinkpad- Incompatible applications (With the M1 processor still being new, you might experience existing programs frequently crash. For example, Chrome keeps crashing) But I would guess there will be a fix soon"
1064,"UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable.The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long.Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using ""swap memory"" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board.***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB.I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models.There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD.***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly.------I purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12"" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1.The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco.I likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive ""Pro Apps"" running at the same time.I would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.I would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball ""not responding"" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1. If however, you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable, faster and cooler running than the Intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable Mac."
1065,"The M1 chip really is amazing. But it only lasted five days for me. Somehow mine managed to break after using a third party USB C hub. The screen wouldn’t turn on at all, and an Apple repair tech couldn’t figure it out after doing a few quick tests. Oh and then Apple said it would take a month to replace it with a new one."
1066,"Beautiful laptop. I’ve upgraded from the MacBook Air of old...so far this laptop has blown it away. It wasn’t overly pricey to be honest and I feel it’s worth the price. Overall look is great and keyboard feel is nice. Larger touchpad is great, I’ve paired my Magic Trackpad 2 with it as well."
1067,"I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13"" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13"" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.Good:- SCREEN looks great!  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  I usually don't go above 50% brightness.- KEYBOARD is good.  Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard.  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic.  Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great.  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.- LOOKS GREAT.  Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.- NO FAN.  That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.- PERFORMANCE.  It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time.  For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU.  Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27"" (top end) with Intel chips.- TOUCH ID is great still.  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons.  On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA.  Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch).  You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay.  And so on and so forth.- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.NOT GOOD:- WEBCAM still sucks.  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc.  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27"" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera).- ONLY 2 PORTS.  Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort).  Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame.  I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.OVERALL:A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem.  Love it so far!"
1068,No complains so far.  Very fast and performs great.  I had a 2014 MacBook Air and finally upgraded this year.  This is leagues beyond that entry and I’m very happy with this upgrade.
1069,"Lightweight, blazing fast, easy to use, battery life is incredible with the new Apple M1 chip.  A typical Great Apple product.However, there is only a Thunderbolt port, so you now have to go out and buy a cable to convert USB to thunderbolt (if you want to use a backup hard drive) or other USB items, AND, I had to buy yet another cable to sync my phone's lightning port to the thunderbolt port on the computer. Total $56.I LOVE Apple product, and worked for them in my caerer, but I would wait on buying this version until the software for it has been developed.UPDATE: After several months of using this computer, I have have found several things of concern:1.  my notification center keeps disappearing, despite my constant reinstalling the widgets.2.  my computer's calendar, reminders, and photo stream do not sync with my IOS devices (iPhone & iPad).  If I add an item to calendar on my phone, it will appear on my mac but not vice versa.  Reminders will not sync regardless of which device I originate the item on.I have contacted Apple support on all these issues and they cannot solve the problem.IT APPEARS THAT THE BUGS HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED OUT, YET.  THINGS ARE MADDENINGLY CLUNKY!"

   Bought this laptop bc i needed it for spring semester and i needed an upgrade from my heavy macbook pro. I go to work too so i needed something super light and thin i can just bring everywhere and slide it in my bag.I am obsessed with how fast this macbook is. The battery life is on point. I used it for movies and series at work and it lasted for 3 days. The processor is definitely sooo good. I open so many tabs at once and it has not lagged on me. The keyboard and trackpad is responsive.I love the color. The main reason why i bought this too. 😍😂I have no problems with it at all.Highly recommend"
1071,Opened my brand new $1000++ computer and the entire screen was cracked and destroyed. Awesome! Thanks Amazon.
1072,"Delivered to me within 12 hours of purchase... Sealed in original apple packaging with protective film, blemish free, not a scratch.. Mint.its powerful, Ive already loaded some big task audio software and broadcast software on it and its flying through the multiple processes together at ease... (Logic 10.5 / Traktor DJ 3.0 / OBS)Super light and portable, If this is a MacBook Pro then I can't even imagine how light the Air models are. Nor could I even imagine why you may need something more powerful. I am having to adjust to the new keyboard and Touch Bar, I keep hitting Siri and volume settings, even as I type this.id also recommend getting a keyboard cover as well.... I hear these keyboards go out sometimes and to repair it. This is no fault to the reseller, but I can't believe Apple with their price points don't offer a bigger SSD for the lowest price point.... 128gb is laughable so be prepared to buy an external SSD along with a Thunderbolt 3 / USB-C Hub to run hdmi, and various external accessories.Overall I love this computer so far, it was a nail biter as I rarely ever shell out $1,000 on anything but I'm very pleased and satisfied with my purchase. And I still cannot find a better deal on the internet, not even used on Facebook marketplace, letgo or craigslist....Five stars"
1073,So not worth it. All they want to do is take your money do NOT BUY THIS ONE! Its used and if you search apple on amazon they have brand new with higher stats for cheaper.
1074,"Just received this, but so far so good. It looks BRAND NEW. There are literally NO signs of cosmetic wear or damage. It arrived in a sealed apple box. I’m finishing setting up and I already love it. For just under $1,200 for a 2019 model, this is a GREAT deal!"
1075,"I really love my MacBook. I really love this laptop. I'm a huge MacBook fan and this works like new. So far I don't have a problem with the butterfly keyboard, but I heard bad reviews about the keyboard from watching YouTube videos. I think that they may have fixed the keyboard problem when they refurbished the product??? I'm not sure, but honestly this a really great laptop for a really great price. I do wish that it came in the original Apple box and packaging, but it wasn't far from the really deal."
1076,"It looks and feels brand spanking new! Definitely happy with my purchase considering that I bought a brand new 2020 MacBook Air and hated it. Returned it back in 2 days. I paid a lot less for the Pro than the Air and its A LOT better with so many features. I’m not trying to persuade anyone out of getting the Air but if you are considering on buying a MacBook my advice would be to just go ahead and get the pro. The Air reminds me of a google chrome book slapped with an Apple logo on it. Not saying that google chrome books are bad, but there’s no need to pay a full band for the Air when you could find something similar and a lot cheaper. All in all I really love this laptop."
1077,"Bought this laptop with some apprehensions, as i have typically bought refurbished goods from apple directly. This was my first from amazon, and i was not disappointed. The notebook was flawless, not a single scratch on it. second, all the accessories where flawless as well, not signs of usage. When i powered on the notebook to verify usage, the battery had cycled only 3 times, meaning it was still in new condition. Very highly recommended seller. Thanks for a pleasant transaction."
1078,"This laptop looked new, straight from Apple store."
1079,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   The screen arrived damaged, what a scam.!"
1080,"Although I was very skeptical about purchasing a ""refurbished"" MacPro, after reading the reviews for this company, I made the purchase.  The MacPro arrived earlier than expected, expertly wrapped, included Apple certified, and in NEW condition.  There is no way I could tell it was not new or refurbished.  The price was the best I could find after researching other sellers.  I would highly recommend iPower Resale Inc to anyone looking for a MacPro.  Their customer service is exceptional.  Thank you for a great product!  5*****"
1081,"When I looked at this product it only had one review and it was a bad one... I then checked all the other products the seller sold and the reviews were excellent, needless to say I took a chance and ordered this MacBook Pro 2019. It arrived before anticipated and it was securely package. I AM SO GLAD I took a chance on them because this MacBook is amazing! Now I’ve waited a couple months before reviewing it to make sure it works. The MacBook looks brand new, it didn’t have any dents or scratches. It works and performs like a new MacBook. I had to contact the seller over the a small issue with the charger and they went above and beyond to correct the issue.Excellent customer service excellent product. I recommend this seller to anyone!"
1082,"I got my new MacBook Pro M1 two weeks ago and could not be more happy with it. This machine is absolutely incredible in terms of speed, looks, weight/size, display, and battery life - and texture (it feels so good against the skin on my wrists as I type) and basically anything else you can think of. I also love the space gray color, the new keyboard, the Touch Bar, and the larger trackpad. There are so many options to customize the system to work just the way I like.My previous MacBook was the 2011 model and it still works today, but after 10 years it became too slow and the trackpad had trouble clicking, so after a TON of research, I decided to pull the trigger and get the New MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.A couple suggestions I am able to give after spending almost two months and probably over 30 hours researching the new MacBook are: go with the standard model of 8gb of RAM and the 256 ssd - you can get this on Amazon for $1239 vs $1299 at Apple - so you get to save 60 bucks, and you have the added satisfaction of not having to deal with the snobby nerd losers that work in the Apple Store, who asked me rudely when I went in to get a new laptop ""umm, do you have an appointment? Well, you're going to have to make an appointment if you want to go in the store"". I love Apple products and will never use another phone or computer besides the iPhone and MacBook, but after that experience I will never again give my business to the physical Apple Stores. I mean, seriously, do you really need me to make an appointment to buy a $1300 laptop? Whatever dude.Anyway, in several YouTube videos that compared the 8GB ram model along side the 16GB ram model (costs 200 bucks more), the 8GB performed just as well in nearly every task - and they really pushed it to the limits. The only reason to pay up for the 16GB RAM is if you want to edit 8K UHD videos or are a super serious music recording artist or highly advanced professional photographer - and even then it's not too much of a difference. For the every day user (me or basically anyone who is not a computer professional) the 8GB working with this new M1 chip is mind-blowing, blows any other laptop on the market completely out of the water, and actually even performs just as well as the $2200 15 inch MacBook Pro using the Intel chip. As far as the storage goes, 256 ssd is standard - that's what I got - and you can pay 200 bucks more for 512 ssd or 400 bucks more for 1 TB. But with the Cloud storage available now, you don't really need to keep much on the laptop drive, you can just save it to the cloud.Overall I honestly could go on for hours about every little detail that I absolutely love about this machine. A free one year subscription to Apple TV is also another little perk. But I am still mystified every day at how incredible this machine is. I've been online for over 3 hours now and its still on 92% battery. The new Retina display is brilliant. Everything is perfect. I truly am in love this laptop and would recommend that anyone looking for a new laptop to last a long time and outperform everything else on the market gets the new matchbook 13 inch M1."
1083,I bought my Mac from Apple directly not from Amazon. This thing is amazing. Battery life is awesome. Hard to believe that I can work with it all day and do not have to charge at all even with bright screen.No issues with speed at all. I use Matlab a lot and this computer is even slightly faster than my desktop with 12 core AMD CPU and 32 GB ram.Excellent machine. Happy I bought it.
1084,"I own over 50 computers and it blows away my 11th gen Dell XPS 13 i7, My surface Book 3, my Ryzen 7 Thinkpad. the first week I got it the battery lasted for 5 days and 22 hrs of use and still had 20% left. I felt guilty and charged it. The Geekbench 5 rating beat all those listed laptops and they had 16 or 32GB of memory and the MacBook Pro M1 had only 8GB of unified memory. The keyboard felt great, the sound was superb, the screen bright, and it was blazing fast in all I did. I'm an IT consultant and deal in Windows based databases and this Mac has now become my daily go to system at home. It has become my new front end."
1085,It's a Mac once you go Mac you never go back. This is my second Mac my first lasted almost 9 years.
1086,Dead at arrival.... kernel error. Took it to the Apple store they told me looks like a hardware failure and to send it back to Amazon.
1087,"I'm going to preface this review with the 1 thing I dislike so we can get that out of the way.I mean let's be honest, that's what most people are looking for when buying a product-the down sides.It has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack EVEN THOUGH apple quit using that on it's handheld products years ago.Not that I care, it's good that they include the 3.5mm jack-but how come they didn't include one for their lightning connector that their headphones come in out of the box? Forces you to either change to a standard headphone jack or BT headphones (probably trying to push their AirPods line).Other than that, I have no issues. It's fast, efficient, reliable and easy to use. If your familiar with iOS on these then it'll be a great addition to the tech team you have at home."
1088,"I love my new MacBook Pro!!  It’s the 13” and not too small. It’s very lightweight!  It’s so fast!  I was using an older MacBook Pro from mid 2012. It worked well, just so slow. This one flies!!  I was disappointed that there are no USB ports or CD player. I spent about $65 at Best Buy and got an adapter that works very well!!!"
1089,The battery lasts forever and its fast. My last macbook had a pretty good battery and worked very well for years too.The M1 does allow for dual external monitors and there are two usbc ports total. These two things can be worked around with dongles and a video hub but now I have $200 worth of accessories and a tangled mess on my desk.How is a 2020 Mac not compatible with dual monitors but my 2005 HP works great with the same monitor setup?!? I really can't get past that.Get the intel version with 4 USB ports and you can use it in your Covid home office out of the box.
1090,"There is no fix for this, and now it can't be returned.  All that money wasted!!! There is a vertical black line on the screen.  I tried to fix it using tips from youtube videos and none of it worked.  Proceed with caution!"
1091,"I really wanted to love this laptop. I've had only Macs for years. This was supposed to be an upgrade from my 2014 MacBook Air. I previously had a 2020 16"" intel based MacBook Pro for work configured with two HP monitors. No issues with the monitors and connected instantly with zero effort to get the screens to work with the laptop. Bought this one and connected to my Belkin hub for the HDMIs. Would only connect a single monitor. Googled the issue and found that the new M1 apple chip only supports a single monitor. News to me and I guess I should have researched more. However the low rating stems from the fact that this is a PRO laptop. A professional would want two monitors and should not have to google whether a PRO laptop supports more than 1 monitor when the intel version does seamlessly. Despite this I had planned to keep it and just deal with 1 monitor because of the cost savings over buying the Intel based MacBook Pro and wanted the longer battery life. Now brings me to the issue that made me return the laptop. This laptop just would not configure to show a clear resolution with my monitors. The scale was off and the display just stayed blurry no matter what setting I changed it to on the monitor or the laptop's settings. Tried and tried and just gave up. Returned this and ordered an Intel based 13"" MacBook Pro. No issues, supports dual monitors, and seamlessly integrated to the laptop. No blurry screen and no having to set or change any settings to get it to work. I am floored that Apple would produce a Pro for business that only supports a single monitor. I love Apple but will not buy anything with their chip until the kinks are worked out."
1092,This is by far the best laptop ive ever owned! The laptop came with 0 scratches and only 16 battery charges on it. It even came with the apple box and stickers! Highly reccomend for the price. $850 is great for a 2019 macbook air.
1093,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Everything I expected and more! Just like brand new!"
1094,I love this laptop so so much. I think everyone should get it. The model is between 2018-2020 and the one I got had the Touch ID on it! Everything was very easy to set up and is in such great quality!
1095,"Received in a timely manner.  Will review in a couple weeks.Well, it's been over 2 weeks since receiving my MacBook Air and I have to admit that it has proven to be worth it's price. The Retina display is phenomenal and it's compact chassis is just what I was looking for. I am not a power user, so I didn't need major memory capacity. The speakers are, surprisingly, crisp and clear for such a slim build. The fingerprint scanner is quick and a huge convenience. I am (or was) a long-time PC user and resisted getting an Apple, but the transition was smooth and Apple's claim to fame for being user-friendly and intuitive proved true. If you are looking for a compact, yet capable laptop with QWERTY keyboard, I would recommend this product."
1096,"After having the laptop a few months, I can say my leap of faith to buy an amazon refurbished was worth it BUT I had to work a little bit.  It didn't arrive perfect and it still isn't perfect.  There is a tiny white dot on the screen where some pixels died (I guess) and when I first got it, I had to call Apple support to get iMessage and Facetime to work on it.  Then I had to take it to the Apple store to get the keyboard fixed as some keys would not work.  Thankfully, I had Apple Care on it so the cost to get it shipped off and fixed wasn't bad.  Overall, I am happy with my purchase and I recommend this seller, but I will probably buy new next time."
1097,"** I have only had the laptop for a week, this review is only based off of the time I have had it**I was so nervous to buy a refurbished computer but this came like it was brand new. New packaging, new charger, spotless laptop. I was worried the battery would be bad and wouldn’t hold a charge. I was wrong. I downloaded over 12,000 photos and was on it nonstop for over 2 days without even having to charge it. I am in love with this!!!"
1098,"As in the description exactly, thank the seller for the fast shipping and good packaging"
1099,I love this laptop and I’m really happy with all the features. Would definitely recommend.
1100,Exactly as expected. Great value.
1101,"The product made a loud buzzing/grinding airplane-type noise as soon as it finished setting up which was truly deafening. I presume it was the fan producing this aggravating sound. No programs were running and the room was approximately 68 degrees Fahrenheit so overheating should not have been an issue. Since no computer should ever sound like a coffee maker at any time, I must conclude that it was defective. Return to sender."
1102,Exceeded my expectations! Some of the reviews had me a bit nervous but I can’t tell you how happy I am! The laptop is on almost brand new condition! Only 1 TINY nick on the front (you can’t see it unless your looking) and it was perfectly ready for me to set up my account! No issues or problems! It comes in a box perfectly protected and has the charger to go with as well👍🏼 So happy with it! Thank you!
1103,"I was so excited because this laptop came in perfect condition. But when I tried to change the unsername to my name it wouldn’t work. 3 calls to Apple later, and I find out this computer is owned by a school that can remotely access my laptop at any time. Meaning, if they wanted to they could shut down and erase my laptop. Amazon gave me a full refund but I am very sad and disappointed"
1104,"All in all, the laptop works great! It runs fast, it’s clean, and it’s perfect for what I needed it. The one disappointment I have it they claimed this product as a catagory A which means like new. When it arrived, the screen had two scratch marks on it that was discolored from the rest of the screen. I would understand like new for any other part to have a scratch, but the screen is a big deal and it should have mentioned that in the details."
1105,"This MacBook Air is amazing!  I had been previously using a 2007 MacBook Air and it was time to upgrade.  I have never purchased refurbished before so I really didn't know what to expect, though was greatly concerned.  Needless to say that this laptop heavily exceeded my expectations.  Other reviewers stated that their MacBook was not as described, though mine looks brand new.  The keys are still crisp and clean, the screen immaculate.  There are a few light scratches on the outside of the computer (mostly the underside), but it is very minimal and unnoticeable.It runs like a dream, though I have only begun using it.  I will update should the computer have any issues.  It is an early 2015 with 4 GB RAM and its OS is Sierra.  I wanted to share that, as I found the Q&A to be a little confusing on that point and other reviews didn't really mention it."
1106,"When I received this package, I was thrilled...until I tried to turn it on and got a “low battery” notification...for 16+ hours. Turns out the cord provided (not a Mac product) is not the correct wattage to charge this device. It’s hard to tell at this point if the computer is faulty or not now that I’ve purchased a new cord from Best Buy, but it shuts down as soon as it’s disconnected from power. The screen is pretty floppy, too- falls back without provocation. All of which seem like things that should have been mentioned in the details before I decided to purchase.After taking this computer to the Apple store, I was informed that the issue was indeed the battery- completely bad and had to be replaced. Again, something that I wish I had known before purchasing. It is in working order now, but doesn’t meet my standards of what “certified refurbished” means, and product details lacking for sufficient purchasing knowledge ahead of time."
1107,"It said I had to do an update. When I hit the only update allowed it said the latest version was already installed but it wouldn’t let me go foward.  Also the screen seemed loose.  So if it was cleared out they never installed the new software correctly. So it wouldn’t let me even get to the main screen.  Others had luck but I did not.Also when I plugged the power bar in. It had a bit of a shock come out. As an electrician, I know that was a big no no.  I was willing to spend the money and get the correct power cord. But with everything else. I thought that’s already 3 strikes. No thanks."
1108,I was very hesitant buying a used MacBook from Amazon but it turned out great! Looks new and works amazingly. You will receive exactly what was described. I have no complaints!
1109,"Good quality, arrived early. As-new condition. Easy to install from my old machine via time machine backup. The old one was a 2010, now we are good for another 5-7 years.Thanks"
1110,I have been struggling with this product since day one. I am not getting responses from the seller OR the extended warranty repair company.I have never had trouble with Amazon before. Every issue I have ever had has been settled with ease and courtesy.This has not. Made more devastating as it it is the largest purchase I have had and the product has been unusable almost since day one. We sent it to the extended warranty place who said they fixed it but it still doesn’t work.We have spent hours at Apple doing diagnostics and it is simply not functional. To repair it would cost more than I paid. They do not think that the parts it was refurbished with are even Apple parts.This was a terrible product and not worth the money.
1111,"I bought this Mac and it came with a non Apple charger, I bought this as travel computer, sure enough in the first week while I was in Europe I had to buy am authentic Apple charger at $117. Now a month  later my Mac has died. It was having issues as in when I tried to maximize the scene with Netflix it would just shrink to a 3x5"" screen volume,  also the screen had been replaced before I bought it and is not well attached, very disappointed, I bought this last summer, but only started to use it in October when I was traveling, so I spent close to $700 for a Mac that lasted 2 months, return and replacement window has ""closed"" so I am stuck with a hefty repair bill."
1112,"Was very iffy about buying refurbished but it’s honestly like new! There are a couple of LITTLE scratches but nothing noticeable! Compared to my friends MacBook Air that she paid 1100$ for and they are the absolute same. Best $500 I’ve ever spent. & the company is AWESOME! The charger didn’t work as soon as I got it & I emailed them. Within an hour I had an email from them and they were sending me a new charger, thankful my friend had her charger that I used until I received mine but the battery last like 2-3 days so it wasn’t that bad."
1113,"Seller: IT5050Wowie! My son wanted an Apple Computer for Christmas and I was not about to spend $1000+ on a laptop for a 11-year-old boy. But a refurbished MacBook was definitely priced more appropriate for him. This computer is AMAZING people!!! Looks so clean and new. Only a couple faint scratches on the bottom, the keyboard looks like it was hardly touched, screen is clear and no burn marks in it, plus the battery is great. The seller was so awesome to get me this gift in time for Christmas, they are quick to respond to emails and followed up to make sure it was delivered afterward. (seriously, the nicest people!) I had purchased another renewed MacBook from another seller, and their level of quality wasn’t as good, by far. I wish I could pre-select a quality grade for the laptop (excellent, good, fair, etc.), so it is a little scary just leaving it up to the unknown. I work in the retail business and I like to applaud small companies who sell quality products. Do yourself a favor and go here, they gave me a laptop that is stellar and eased my worries about a refurbished laptop. It really looks so good and is operating perfectly. This is such a smarter way to buy a computer, especially for kids, or if you like to have the pricier brands without spending the high price. – Happy Mommy!"
1114,"Wow! Bought this from TECHarvard and was claimed to be Certified Refurbished, which according to the Amazon description should show limited to no signs of wear.  Well the device that I received not only was pretty scratched on the bottom, had a huge ding on the corner of the top cover, but the keyboard showed more signs of wear than the MacBook that I've had for 5 years(Space bar was completely warped).  Definitely does not resemble a new device in any way shape or form.  If they are selling used devices, call them used and mark the price down accordingly.  This is definitely going back."
1115,"Overall the laptop is nice. A couple of marks on the outside but works relatively well. There was an issue with the battery that originally came with it. It would shut off around 65% battery life. I asked the seller for a replacement battery, which they gave to me free of charge. However, the replacement battery is not originally an Apple battery and instead a knock off. This issue prompted it to restart randomly no matter what the battery life was at. I’m putting the original battery back in and having Apple replace it with the appropriate battery for an additional fee. I got what a paid for and I won’t make the mistake of buying a refurbished Apple product from anywhere other than the Apple store again."
1116,This is the BEST purchase I’ve ever made! The laptop 💻 arrived on time and in MINT condition. It functions beautifully and works flawlessly for my personal and business needs. I would recommend this seller to any & all I know who are in the market for reliable and affordable devices.
1117,"Battery doesnt work! I travel to another country with the laptop and web I turned on and unplug it, it shuts down! And in Battery Options appears ""Replace now"". How you can help me? I'm in Ecuador now and wont be back in a year!"
1118,"I love my new MacBook Air, it came as expected (relatively like new condition). This my first Mac and I’d purchase it again refurbished, you save greatly and get almost the same product 😀"
1119,Bought certified refurbished ended up with a unit with a screen covered in dead pixels. I contacted apple to see how much a screen replacement should be more I'm looking a repair cost more than I paid for the laptop.
1120,"DO NOT BUY!!! I purchased this computer for about two month and one day I couldn’t turn it on after it goes into sleep mode for a long time. It just wouldn’t turn no matter what I do, I tried every single method out there. I had to press the power button a hundred times for it to finally turn on. But after a while even that won’t work. The computer is just dead. I had to take it to the computer store and they told me it costs $434 to fix it!!!! Even though I actually paid to get it fixed I recommend everyone do not buy!! It’s not worth the money and will cost you more!! The guy in the computer store told me that there is corrosion inside the motherboard and in order to fix it it costs a lot of money ($434). I am truly upset and wished I would have just bought a brand new one from apple that’s the newest version and which will cost me less than what I spent on this computer!!"
1121,"The laptop worked great the first week. Eventually, things started to decline and quickly.  I would constantly have to change the time clock, and that would prevent many apps from working properly or not at all. I also discovered that my webcam did not work. I asked customer service if I could get a replacement laptop, and they gave me a website to help me fix it myself. It did not work. Also, the computer would start dying very quickly, even after a full charge. I would also not start up automatically, even with the charger plugged in. I had to press to start button almost endlessly for it to just power on. Eventually, it just would not cut on at all, even with the charger plugged in. It’s completely dead. Apple says that it should cut on with the charger plugged in if it were a battery issue, so it’s definitely something wrong with it beyond that and it will cost upwards of $400 to fix. I’m totally bummed. It did not even last a year."
1122,"BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY MOTHER, SHE IS 70 YEARS OLD AND BARELY USES THE LAPTOP.THE SCREEN IS IN THIS STATE, APPEARS TO BE PEELING! VERY BAD!!"

   Note: My purchase was completed through Kanga Supply for this item that ultimately doesn't function as intended.Amazon Renewed item descriptions indicate that the products should work and look like new, which wasn’t the case for this purchase, ergo my poor rating. After only having the Macbook for less than a day, I was forced to reach out to the seller because the product no longer functioned as intended.CONSThe Macbook worked fine for the first hour or so of use, but during an update, the screen flickered vigorously (see video). I hoped it was just a fluke, and it led me to believe there may be some software or hardware-related issue. After having the Macbook for less than 12 hours, I was forced to reach out to the seller because the screen flickering caused the laptop to become unusable (see picture). I also came here to draft a review in hopes that my issue is resolved quickly and effectively. I'll update my review once this is complete.PROSAfter removing the laptop and inspecting the outside, I was pleased. The outside of the Macbook is in good condition, just one or two visible scratches or marks.The charger was not the original Apple charger (as other reviews have indicated) but an OEM adapter. I don’t care that much about whether it’s an Apple charger, as long as it functions.Specs match the advertised item I purchased:128GB SSD8GB ramEDIT/UPDATE: After reaching out to the seller as instructed with the Amazon Renewed products, I never got a response in the allotted timeframe (2 business days) and was forced to reach out to Amazon directly. Ultimately, this item was returned for a refund.UPDATE 2: Today is 1/13/2020 and I have still yet to see this problem resolved to my satisfaction (refund or exchange of working product), after having ordered this product on 12/26/2019. Highly disappointed both in Amazon and the third-party seller.UPDATE 3: Received a replacement Macbook on 1/15/2020. So far it seems to be working, no issues with the screen per the previous item received (was NOT the same item sent back, verified by serial number). Pleased so far with this item."
1124,"The 2015 Macbook Pro is still, in my opinion, the best Macbook even in 2019.  I use the SD card reader all the time and have several USB 3.0 devices.  I also use a newer 2017 quad-core i7 for work (no choice) but the difference in speed is not worth the added money and lacking ports.  When I actually put the newer 2017 to work, the heat issue is still a challenge for Apple and performance drops.  It's like having power that I can't actually use unless I sit in a walk-in freezer. Don't quote benchmark speed tests to me, what counts is actual performance sitting at my desk for hours at a time working on a project. I also prefer the magsafe power (although this one uses the magsafe II which I like less than magsafe I which had a more solid connection) This one, I purchased for my wife and it handles everything she needs it to do. Although you can't upgrade the memory on these models, so make sure you get enough for what you need.  If you want to change out memory, then the best choice is the Mid 2012 non-retina model which also come with DVD drives and has USB 3.0 ports."
1125,"First off, I am removing a star because they shipped a counterfeit 60W Magsafe 2 charger with my order. I contacted them immediately and they offered to accept a return of everything. I explained that the charger was my only complaint and they overnight FedEx'd a genuine Apple replacement for free.""we sent you the wrong adapter for this batch of order and will overnight you the correct genuine one.""So they knowingly ship counterfeit chargers with some of their orders?The computer is pretty good cosmetically and operationally, but not as great as other reviewers. It is an Early-2015 12,1 model, this one was built in 12/2016. There is a crease over the right USB port from somebody yanking a USB plug. The battery has 107 cycles (89% life left). Keyboard and display are in great shape with no flaws. The SSD has no dead cells. It came with MacOS 10.13 installed.Overall its a good laptop and decent refurbishment job.EDIT: Knocking off another star. They sent me another counterfeit charger. Apple would never loosely jumble the cord in the box, a genuine power supply doesn't stay powered on for several seconds after it's unplugged from the main or stay lit green/orange after its unplugged from the laptop and this fake only puts out 25 watts max."
1126,"I really feel like I got a great deal on this, mine arrived in brand new condition and it looked like it had never been used. I did see some people had bad experiences but mine was well worth the price tag. The only negative was that the charger provided is third party and not OEM Apple. The box is also generic and not Apple, not a big deal but you just don't get that same feeling opening it up as a new product. I will say that I checked the serial number on Apple and the computer itself was only a couple of years old, so in reality I paid around $450 for an Apple that was only a couple of years old with a decent amount of battery life still left. I only bought this as there was certain tasks that I could not do on my iPad and so I did not need a brand new super powerful computer. This one is great, does not get hot, fans are silent and the display looks incredible.Overall I was very happy with the purchase, it came fast and was like new condition at the fraction of the cost of a new one. I actually waited a few months before writing this review so that I could also include that I have had no issues at all in that time, battery lasts a decent amount of time and no software or hardware issues to report. It also runs the latest OS that I updated it to and I believe it will be supported software wise for some time to come. Completely worth the price!"
1127,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   The Macbook came in working condition with all original components and an OEM charger but not with the extension cord. The major downfall is the condition of the laptop, for the above average asking price for this model I expected great condition as it is stated to be like new but instead the model I received was in okay condition (not cleaned either, large collection of gunk in hinge vent) at best with a lot of edge scratches and deep cuts throughout the chassis, and some unremovable stains from stickers! And worst of all the battery was at over 500 cylces, the battery life was 4-5 hrs max! thats horrible for whats suppose to be a renewed device! Not satisfied!EDIT:  Avoid this entire listing especially from the seller ''Easymobiledevices'', they ship dirty grade b laptop and have poor costumer service."
1128,Once i started running it all sort of problems arises. First major problem is wifi drops off and will not let you connect to wifi. After this happens you cant even turn on/off the wifi. Used guest and still no wifi. Restarting or shutdown and restart will not activate wifi. If you restart it takes so long to reboot. Sometimes it get stuck on the waiting wheel on startup. One out of ten restart wifi will work for a minute but then drops off and you will no longer be able to connect again. I cant say anything physically because it looks fine. Lastly beware it shows and says freshly installed mojave os but it has instead sierra installed. The power cord looks like an imitation and not the original one because from the weight it is not the original one. I can tell because i have multiple macbook at home and that is not the original one. I am pretty disappointed with this seller.
1129,"I’ll update 15 days from today.CONS:-Delivery packaging: it was a regular box with one thick bubble wrap to protect the laptop.First glance, the charger seems pretty beat up but seems to work fine.-The outer top of the laptop has a lot of scuff marks and scratches. Sides do as well. Nothing TOO severe.-Bottom have some scratches and wearing on the rubber, not too noticeable.PROS:-Had a full battery-Set up went smoothly with no hiccups.-Outer signature glowing Apple works well.-Opening the laptop, the screen has no visible scratches, cracks, or scuffs at all.-Keyboard has no loose keys and is glowing well.-Trackpad has no scratches and works really well no weird working sides SO FAR.-Software automatically updated to Catalina, kinda wanna wait to update to Big Sur.I’ll update March 13, 2021"
1130,"Still a GREAT LAPTOP, arguably the best MacBook Pro 13” ever made, 2 or 3 iterations later! I have had mine for 3 months now and although I was a little disappointed that I got a no-brand MagSafe power brick instead of an Apple brand, it’s caused no problems for me. I have been using Logic Pro X a lot and it runs nice and smooth even with the haphazard way I use it, leaving muted unused tracks all over the place as I learn about things like track bouncing and experiment with every single effect and different audio formats (I feel bad sometimes like I am unnecessarily abusing the laptop, lol) and I haven’t frozen or crashed at all. I have used a few emulation programs for old Saturn, Super Famicom, PS and Dreemcast games that push the 2D sprite and parallax scrolling envelope and again I haven’t had any problems. Only thing I have experienced that has been an issue is the actual Mac OS and it’s limitations with regard to formats, programs that it supports and connectivity with outside developers but I have also been able to get around that by setting Virtual Machines up and GUID partitioning to use whatever other OS I need. This is also not a complaint about the hardware itself but rather the Mac OS software so should not be considered when it comes to the actual MacBook Pro 13”.You will want to upgrade to an NVME M2 SSD at least 256 GB or 512 GB right away, as the 128 GB SSD will fill up within 2-3 months of moderate use and the newer M2s will increase the OS loading speed more than anything else. Luckily you have your pick of great SSDs like the Samsung 970 Evo, etc that you can easily swap in with a $5 adapter, a screwdriver and no soldering (just search YouTube for “MB Pro 13 2015 SSD upgrade”)…The unique things and PROS about this MB Pro 13” are the older style KEYBOARD that doesn’t break like 2016-later model keyboards do, 2 USB 3 ports, an SD CARD R/W and a FULL SIZE HDMI PORT all built in. This is the last MB Pro 13 with any of those ports on board and the fact that you can swap SSD hard drives with no soldering and very little skill needed, all-in with the M2 you get a sexy little powerhouse for half the price of the newer model Pro 13”s (1/4 price of current gen)! The rest (CPU, onboard graphics, sound/speakers) make this laptop a must have that will likely only appreciate in value $$$!Two Thunderbolt 2/miniDisplayPorts are useful if you want to setup 2-3 Screens, but the CONS Are that you get NO ThunderBolt 3/USB-C ports and more and more adapters and devices require that connection these days, though with the USB 3 ports there are ways around it, complicated as they may be. You also CANNOT UPGRADE RAM unless you know how to de-solder the current ram and solder up new ram (accepts up to 16GB DDR-3 in 2X8GB formation) and setup the machine to accept the new ram, which seems a recipe to completely destroy the board/laptop without at least some Mac building & Mac hardware programming know-how, possibly even special equipment.MAKE SURE YOU GET THE MODEL WITH THE AMOUNT OF RAM YOU NEED BUILT IN & a CPU that will be sufficient for you and you won’t be disappointed with this awesome little 6 year old laptop! Don’t get the 4 GB model even if it will “work” for you “short-term”! I got the 8GB/i5 2.9Ghz/128GB and I already regret not paying another $100 for the 16GB ram model, but c’est la vie.Just buy this MacBook Pro 13” while you can, replace the SSD as soon as possible, enjoy it, keep it another 5-10 years and you will likely be able to triple your investment by reselling it assuming Apple stays on their current trajectory with their MB Pro Hardware releases!!!"
1131,"Hi, I bought this Macbook Pro 13"" early 2015 and received last week on Aug 23th. The laptop has a good appearance and doesn't have any flaws. However, the charger(45w) packed together with the macbook is not for macbook pro but for  Macbook Air. I just found out today, cuz when I use the charger(45w) laptop cpu temperatures goes up to 65-85 celcius. and I can't use more than 4 hours. But when I charge my macbook with Macsafe 1 (85w, which is for Pro), the cpu temperature keeps 40-50 degree, and it runs around 10hours. I want to change my charger into “MacBook Pro Charger 85w”. Thank you."
1132,I'm very dissatisfied with this purchase.I can't use the Mac because the hard drive was not reset and the software on the Mac dose not allow you to use it.Also there was no charger.Again very disappointed.
1133,"Looks brand new, wrapped and sealed in Apple packaging. Plugged it in and turned it on and let it go. Absolutely no problems, it was automatic and wonderful to have the computer set itself up. Has performed flawlessly as expected of an Apple laptop."
1134,"The laptop arrived in fair condition.  The screws show signs of wear so it may have been opened up during the ""renewal"" process.  Old stickers were left on the bottom. Also, the laptop was shipped with a cheap knockoff Chinese charger.  I have no reason to trust this charger so I'll have to order a genuine Apple one instead.Fortunately I don't need this machine to be a workhorse or I would send it back.  This should survive a year at least but I don't trust it as-is - I will wipe the hard disk, NVRAM, and SMC just to be safe."
1135,Product was faulty. The charging port wouldn't hold the plug. I returned it. I don't think the refurbishing process is very competent.
1136,"This is exactly like the MacBook I was given for work that was stolen on a plane flight. No problems with this as a replacement so far, smooth sailing for 3 months already! I got the protection plan just in case, but I'm very satisfied with this cheaper than new replacement. Will update if there are any issues that arise. Would recommend."
1137,"Idk what I was thinking not having an apple in the first place. This laptop is very easy to use, fast, and I’m excited to see how productive I can be with this format. I feel free, nothing holding me back now!! Unlike old pc with unresponsive interface, slow speeds, and constant crashes, this one gives me no problems!!"
1138,This laptop was literally like brand new out of the box. So far my daughter is so thrilled with her graduation gift. She is ready for college now!!!
1139,"Our first ever Mac but so far its been quite impressive. It was easy to setup and get it going. It works well and very easy to use, turn on/off, carry around and day to day life. Wish the battery would last a bit longer."
1140,"BUYER BEWARE!I knew by choosing a refurbished computer, I was taking a risk, but I never expected this. When I received this MacBook Air, I was surprised it was the model Apple stopped making in 2017, since the title said “Newest Version.” I emailed the seller and they said Amazon forced that in the title and told me I could return it. I work full time, am in grad school, and have three kids. I figured with it being an Apple it would last long enough to get me through school, so I kept it. Now, six months later the screen won’t turn on. It’s completely black.I am able to connect to an external monitor and use the computer that way, so I know it’s the display. After trying to adjust the brightness, several resets, resetting the SMC and the PRAM, I called Apple Support. They ruled out all software issues and told me it had to be the hardware.At this point I contacted the seller and they basically told me “sorry, it’s outside of the 90 day window so there’s nothing we will do for you.” I have escalated to Amazon trying to get some kind of resolution. They just confirmed there is nothing they are willing to do for me. They also are not doing anything to penalize the seller, All Out Apple. I'm shocked at Amazon. Shady sellers like All Out Apple will always be around, but I really thought Amazon was better than Ebay in that way. Lesson Learned.There is no reason a MacBook Air should have a display of a completely stops functioning after six months of use, even refurbished. I’m grateful that I had a work-provided monitor I can plug into to do my schoolwork, but if I was aiming to be tethered to my desk, I would have bought a Mac Mini."
1141,"Got the computer two days early! this was probably the fastest delivery I've ever received from amazon. I wasn't going to buy refurbished but I really wanted another MacBook and shelling out $2k for a new one was simply out of the question. When I saw the price for this MacBook Air, I decided to roll the dice and buy it. I knew it could possibly come not as advertised, such as having scratches or not being updated as far as software is concerned but when I opened it up it was practically BRAND NEW! set up was simple as can be! only took me 5 minutes to sign in with my Apple ID and all my information was synced between my iPhone and iPad and onto the MacBook Air. There were a few minor scratches less than a couple centimeters on the bottom of the computer nothing that noticeable. the charger doesn't stick as well as I'd like and one of the hinges is half broken off but I've that same issue with practically every MacBook I've ever had. I was really surprised with the quality. it said 2017 version but with all the updates and new iterations its hard to gauge which MacBook your getting I thought I was purchasing a much older MacBook Air than what I got this thing is amazing and the 13 in screen is far larger than I expected it to be feels like a 15 or 17 in display when having it in your hands/ the computer itself is incredibly light, the main reason I chose the air you can carry it in anywhere with one hand and hardly feel it definitely much lighter than my 2020 iPad 11"" All in all if you're on a budget, this computer is the way to go! for $400 its practically brand new and runs like a dream! thanks amazon for this incredible refurbished Mac! love it !"
1142,"I don’t what to think I bought 2017 16gb 256 ssd but I received a refurbished 2019 8g 256 perfectly packaged, I can’t put apple care I already call for that but im not sure to keep it because I want a computer of 16of ram but this one is 2019, im gonna give the chance to see how it works, And it cost me the same price of a refurbished 2019 Of apple but those ones you can put apple care"
1143,"hola, soy de peru. Estoy contento con la compra, la compre por el precio, y me llego tal cual las especificaciones.(late2018,2.3gz,8ram,256ssd). la bateria llego con 350 ciclos aproxen cuanto a lo estetico, tenia pequeños arañones en un costado, pero nada grave, la pantalla intacta y el touchbar ok. el cargador sellado oem.califico la compra como 9/10."
1144,Got a few months out of this before the screen started disappearing intermittently. Then it wasn't so intermittent. I'd have much rather spent the extra money to get a new computer that didn't break than to buy something second-hand and have to decide to repair or replace.
1145,"Considering I was 100% ripped off, I would not recommend you purchase from this seller, I did not receive what I wanted, the serial number for a COMPUTER comes up as an iPhone 11... Just.. No."
1146,This computer was working fine and all of a sudden the screen went out.  Cost me $640 to fix it.
1147,"Delivery was super fast, considering I’m in South Africa. The laptop is simply beautiful, woks well, no complaints, I love it."
1148,"Positivo, EXCELENTE EQUIPO!!!"
1149,So far this was a steal. Great product for a great value.
1150,super machine
1151,The space key and some of the keys were not working As they are supposed to. Really sticky
1152,"Arrived, boxed well with balloon cushions. Power adapter looked clean but had scratches. Opened up the Lid of the MacBookPro and it looked like it had some sort of disease or cancer & it smelled quite strange too. It had over 50% battery so I carried on with a reset which resulted in an error. Luckily it booted back into Yosemite OS that it had installed years ago, after 3 failed attempts managed to update to Mojave. Of course first things first copy music etc onto, USB stick struggled to go in either of the USB Ports (look at the photos) was also stuck after insertion but managed to pull out, with a hard pull - full force - anger. Had a look into the ports and discovered they were literally rusted dirty like disgusting, this is not the definition of Refurbished - but 2nd Hand or Heavily Used. Be aware, set your expectations right in oder to avoid any disappointments."
1153,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I was super stoked upon arrival, began setting up the laptop and within minutes the screen stopped working. Literally pixels. Severely disappointed. I have gotten ahold of kanga and they are working to replace the device but it has now been over a week since I’ve purchased the unit with two day shipping and still have nothing to show for it. I hope they come through on their end and send me a functional unit."
1154,"I've only had it for about a week now and this 2015 MacBook Pro is working phenomenally! I was kinda hesitant buying a refurbished MacBook from Amazon, but I can honestly say I'm go glad I went ahead and did. It came extremely fast and right from opening the box, it was as if I had bought a brand new one right from Apple themselves. There's not a scratch, dent, stain, dust or anything on it. So far it's working extremely well and I will definitely buy form this seller in the future and recommend them to others as well! Great price for a great computer."
1155,"I’ve had this MacBook Pro going on 4 days and so far so good! It has met all my expectations and more. I grew up using windows PCs. This is my first Apple computer and I’m happy to have made the transition. Wish I did this long time ago but better late then never. If it wasn’t for the packaging and not being in the original box, I probably wouldn’t be able to tell this was refurbished. This is just based from my experience using MacBooks at the Apple store. Also, there was a few minor scratches on the bottom of the laptop.I will revise and change review in a month if any problems. But as of now, my review above is how I feel."
1156,"I've only had it for a couple days, but so far this is a great purchase. The thing looks brand new, and I know it isn't. I am replacing an older Mac and just can't afford the prices of new machines from Apple. Using Migration Assistant (an app that comes with Macs) I was able to restore a time machine backup from the old machine, so I've lost nothing in the transition."
1157,"When I ordered this product for the first time, it came with a green line on the screen. I contacted the costumer service, they responded very quickly and replaced it.The second computer came with better specs, I was the happiest person... for 2 months though, the computer suddenly stop responding.Other things that are worth saying:- The charger is generic. A generic charger can easily damage the battery of the computer, that could explain my problem.- The second computer they sent, had a sticker that covered the whole low part of the computer (those stickers that are the same color as the computer and are used to cover up very big scratches.Conclusion: they can deliver a great costumer service, but not a working product."
1158,"The macbook pro only worked for a short while. It had a charging/powering problem - wouldn't keep a charge at first, then wouldn't power on even when plugged in. Confirmed it was not a charger issue.I contacted the company who said to send it back for repair. Once they received it they wrote saying it cannot be fixed and charged me a ""restocking fee"" in the amount of the purchase of the laptop. Outrageous!! I even had a protection plan for it. After numerous interactions they refused to help and returned the laptop without telling me. THEN they said they couldn't do anything in terms of a refund because I had the machine. Months later they refuse to resolve it and amazon can't help me because it's a third party seller. An ABSOLUTE JOKE of a company. I'm out over $500.00 with a computer that can't be fixed - and Apple store said they could try but for more than the computer's worth. So yeah. They have my money and I have nothing.DO NOT BUY from these people if you'd like to keep your money."
1159,"Hey all! So I’ve gotten into photography lately and needed a upgrade from my old 2012 MacBook Pro and 2011 Asus laptops for editing. Figured a 2015 model would be the way to go for a decent upgrade without spending tons of money. I was super skeptical about buying a reconditioned one through Amazon after reading the reviews and thought about it for about 4 hours before I made the transaction. Next day it was at my door step with me a bit nervous about opening the package and seeing a beat up MacBook, I opened the box and the MacBook was in a bubble wrapped sleeve and that’s it. Okay I’m fine with that but what was the condition of it? Looks like it barely got used or the previous owner always had a case on it. Outside from a few nicks here and there it’s flawless. Turns on and is super quick, the Retina display is beautiful and definitely enjoyable to watch movies. It came with Mojave so the first thing I did was update it to Big Sur and it’s still flawless. I’ve only had it for a day if that but so far I’m happy with my purchase. Just be mindful yours may or may not be like mine condition wise I got lucky. Should you buy one of these? I would I’m pleased with my purchase and I’m sure you would be too. But I’ll update with any issues if they come up in the future. Thankfully I’m a bit tech savvy so whatever happens I’m sure I can fix it."
1160,"This of course this is an old model and reconditioned/renewed, so I was expecting it to look somewhat used; however, this MacBook Pro is in PERFECT CONDITION as if I had purchased it new. I'm upgrading from a very heavy and slow 2009 white MacBook that's a dinosaur and I could only do very basic things on it. It has almost zero capability in terms of battery life (it could only be used plugged in) so this laptop is an absolute gem in comparison. This might be why I'm so hyped and elated. Plus the price was very good. *I hope the computer doesn't have some sudden glitch and dies on me...lol!Now, I can finally edit my videos in iMovie, which was not working on the old MacBook, because I couldn't update it anymore. I need this laptop mainly for traveling, to do editing work, I have a 2 monitor PC set-up at home. My only wish is that I could transfer my Adobe CS to the new laptop.SIDE NOTE: it's actually overall a little smaller than my old 13"" (screen size is the same), it's not as heavy, but not as light as the Air; it arrived with Catalina iOS installed and I had to upgrade to Monterey to use the newest version of iMovie - this isn't a complaint, just an observation."
1161,"I bought for my mom, great deal (sort-of), works great (after I deleted 2 mysterious old unknown wifi connections)I bought this for my mom, she was always having Windows problems, viruses disguised as virus removal, scammy pop-ups, and so on.  Happy day!  :DThey raised prices during Prime Day, wth?  I thought I was getting a good deal, but afterward I noticed the price went down.  Anyway, I ordered this for my mom.  She's been using Windows and I wanted her to experience a Macbook Pro.  This one is actually even better than mine!  I'm still happily using a Late 2013 2.4 Ghz 8 RAM 256 GB 13-inch Retina, her's is exactly the same except it's a Early 2015 and it's actually got 2.7 Ghz!  Anyway she seems really happy with it.  I set it up for her, and ran the serial number, which was not found, not surprisingly although I'm not sure what that means, and the update page in the App Store looks like it was coded in 1995, so I'm not sure what's up with that.  Could be something funky going on, but all I know is it works and we're happy with it.  She's getting used to using it, and she says it's fast and smooth.  She was getting tired of all the Windows updates and virus stuff and all the spammy popups telling her to purchase a virus disguised as virus removal, yadda yadda yadda, so I am well-pleased that she is now almost a full-blown Mac-head.  Thanks Apple.  I hope to be able to afford an Apple car when they do come out, haha.  I'm not sure about the battery-life yet, but I HAD TO replace the battery on mine, so replacing it on hers should not be a problem."
1162,It’s just one continuous problem after the other with this computer. It’s really not worth it to save a little bit of money just buy new not refurbished have your warrantee you’re better off in the long run.
1163,For this being my first ever Mac- This was an amazing buy... no scratches or dents. Its basically BRAND NEW. 😝😝😝The only thing is that it says 512gb but the space says 256gb so be wary of that.But other than that I am really happy with my purchase.
1164,Good
1165,Love it
1166,"the product arrived with the screen broken. I would like a refund of $ 400 to repair it, since he is now in Brazil."
1167,So happy with this purchase. Even my kids said it looks like the new ones. Has some minor imperfections but at the cost totally acceptable. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.
1168,"I purchased through amazon this m1 chip 512 gb 8ram macbook pro 2020 year manufacture.  I’m a mac user of many years.  The computer is blazing fast, slim, light with great battery life. A huge bonus—-little need for additional  anti virus add on software since the macbook anti virus platform is very solid. A hidden gem when you buy any apple device is phenomenal tech telephone support.  The advisors at the apple stores and by telephone are the best part of the apple experience for me and even rival the devices they sell. Yes, I hate the high prices and know the game but over time I’ve  accepted their price points because of the incredible tech support."
1169,battery would not take any charge  stuck at 1%
1170,"I cannot believe the condition my Macbook is in, you can’t even tell if it’s used and the packaging was very nice and professional with the white box and wrapped just like it is when you get it directly from Apple. I am super happy with my purchase, thanks Amazon."
1171,"Good, but it is a little small.. easy to control. Recommend if you are hard to control your computer"
1172,Computer will not charge.
1173,"""Refurbished"" even though Battery life was non existent from the startup, always check the reviews on laptops to make sure they have over 200, cause then you won't be played by greedy ass people like I was"
1174,"Minor scratches , for the price reduction is a great buy !!!"
1175,Light weight
1176,"El producto reacibdiocionado en muy buen estado, funciona perfectamente y venía totalmente protegido y embalado. Muy satisfecho con la compra"
1177,"Looks and acts brand new. Everything exactly as advertised. Will update if I have any issues but after a week I can say, I am pleasantly surprised!"
1178,"This is an unusually large advance over previous models, especially in raw computing power, but also in fun things like screen and headphone support.This Amazon listing has two different processors, the M1 Pro (listed as 16-Core GPU ""style"") and the M1 Max (32-Core GPU). I'll call one the Pro, the other the Max. I got the base Pro, but much of what I'll say applies to both, and I'll have some comments specifically about the Max too. (MBP below = MacBook Pro.)Amazon doesn't offer most of the options you can get, only the ones listed. For now (and probably later), that's the Pro with 16GB RAM and 512GB or 1TB SSD, or the Max with 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD. 3 versions total.Screen Brightness* and HappinessThis screen can get up to 1600 nits brightness and can sustain full-screen brightness up to 1000. That's very impressive, as MBPs since 2016 have topped out at 500.*But the vast majority of the time, this screen will also top out at 500, because those other numbers are only for HDR (high dynamic range, what Apple calls XDR), i.e. some videos and some photos viewed in some programs. If you're browsing the internet, using productivity apps, or the like, those are almost all SDR (standard dynamic range). You'll be seeing them at the same brightness as with MBPs for the last five years.That said, the new screen is beautiful and bright in both HDR and SDR for most situations. For HDR, it puts out more color and brightness, and darker blacks - a million-to-one contrast ratio - with a wider range of light and color that has more pop and more detail in shadows and highlights. It can be dazzling or just more realistic.For SDR, it's much like before, still a gorgeous screen, with better contrast than before because of darker blacks.Has more pixels per inch (254, up from 226), and more pixels all over (3456 by 2234, up from 3072 by 1920). The aspect ratio remains 16:10 (not counting the top menu bar).ProMotionProMotion is Apple's name for screen refresh rates that can go up to 120Hz, or lower to save processor/battery power when 120 isn't needed. This makes motion smoother, more natural.For now where ProMotion applies is limited. Most scrolling in browsing, including with Safari, still tops out at 60Hz. Which is fine for me, but it bothers some people, looks choppy to them. This could be changed with a software update.Bloom and GhostsBloom is when a bright spot on a dark background bleeds out past where it's supposed to be, a common issue with this kind of screen. I and most others think this screen handles it well (better than the iPad Pro), but it can still arise some.Ghosting is when a moving object leaves a noticeable trail of ghost images behind for a fraction of a second, one for each new frame until the old image fades. MBPs are notoriously mediocre at this kind of ghostbusting, and this screen is no exception. Expect the usual haunting, if you notice that kind of thing.PWMFor those concerned (you mostly know who you are), there is PWM (pulse-width modulation) on the smaller 14"" version of this screen, and so very likely on this one too, at a frequency of 14,880Hz at all brightness levels (measured by NotebookCheck). That's a very high frequency, considered well beyond what would cause trouble for the susceptible.The NotchAs you can see in the main photo here, there's a black Notch at the top of the screen. There are no pixels there. The long-desired improved camera is there, and a mic array and light sensor (and maybe room for a Face ID system if they decide to make MBPs with that). As with the iPhone Notch, it's controversial.You can make the Notch disappear, or rather blend in, if you make the background up there black. It also disappears into the black bars when you view things like videos in full-screen mode.The cursor disappears into the Notch if you put it there. If an app has menu items that stretch there, they disappear too, but they'll still function normally if you put the (invisible) cursor on them.Desperate times call for desperate measures. Most apps won't have this trouble, but if you must, you can avoid menu items disappearing by using the ""Scale to fit"" function, which shrinks the entire screen work area a little to fit below the Notch. Makes it look like an old 15"" if the background is black, like there are wide black bezels. (Google ""Scale to fit below built-in camera"" for full instructions and mockery.)There are also third-party apps, such as Bartender, to manage how items appear in the menu bar and keep them visible.Camera and MicsThe new camera that, along with the thinner bezels, makes the Notch necessary, is 1080p, with an f/2 lens for good exposure in the shadows. Video looks noticeably better than before, though it can have a processed look.The three mics sound very clean and natural but with a little less bass than before to my ears, which is fine.Extra ScreensYou can use two external monitors with the Pro, down from four with previous models. They can be up to 6K @60Hz with a billion colors. The Max can still use four: three 6K and one 4K, all @60Hz etc.You can use 4K @120/144Hz HDR monitors too.You can run two from one port if you use the right kind of dock or daisy-chain.Headphone OomphThe new headphone jack has more power for high-impedance headphones. It automatically adjusts, so it won't overwhelm low-impedance phones. If the headphones have less than 150 ohms impedance, they get 1.25 volts RMS. If more, 3 volts. That might cause it to fail to provide enough power to some not-so-high-impedance headphones that still require extra power, such as planars.With my 2016 15"" MBP, I've had to use a portable amp for my Beyerdynamic DT 1990 Pros (250 ohm), but now I can pretty well do without it, though sometimes only just. The volume on some sources is still not always what I wish I could make it. But now I can nearly achieve hearing loss with the intro to the guitar riff in ""Money for Nothing."" Which also sounds good, and healthier, a couple notches down.Among other headphones that have tested favorably with the new jack are the DT 990 Pros (250 ohm), and the Sennheiser HD650, 660S, 6XX, and HD800 (150 to 300 ohm).One report says the planar Hifiman HE4XXs (35 ohm planar) sound good, but most planars tested are said to need more power. The Audeze LCD-2Cs are reported to sound good enough, though not their best. The LCD-3s and Hifiman Sundaras and Aryas are said to be underpowered.For my usual regular-impedance phones, Cleer Flow IIs (16 ohm), the wired volume is a little louder than before, though still not always the earsplitting barrage I want for some sources. Maybe for the best.Quality iems (in-ear monitors) that require especially clean input, but not too much, reportedly sound good, including Andromedas and Moondrop Starfields.SpeakersThey're improved from the already laptop-leading speakers from earlier MBPs, with a fuller sound and decent kick, amazingly good for when nothing with a 3"" woofer is around.Apple mysteriously says the 14"" M1 has the same speaker system, but looking inside both machines shows the speakers in the 16"" are bigger - both ""subs"" and tweeters - and located differently, with the subs in the front corners on this one. The 16"" has fuller bass (such as it is).Heat and NoiseThere isn't any.None with my typical use, at least. If you push it hard, it can get warm, but not as hot as my 2016 15"". Which makes sense, as this has a larger enclosure, bigger fans, larger, better heat sinks, and more power-efficient processors. The fans don't have to spin up as much to do the same amount of cooling, so it's noticeably quieter even when it does heat up, rarely makes any noise at all.The 16"" Max comes with a larger heat sink than the 16"" Pro, so likely runs a little cooler and quieter sometimes, though the Max might get hotter when it uses a lot of that extra power.KeyboardVery quiet, much like the older Mac laptop keyboards, not the butterfly ones from 2015-19, but the rest. Maybe less travel in the keys than some of those, but plenty for me.I miss the touch bar sliders for fine control of some functions, but you can still use sliders via the Control Center, the icon next to the date on the screen's top menu bar. That's also where control of the keyboard backlight is, no more control for it on the keyboard.TouchpadThe best available by far, responsive and large so you can carry the cursor over a large area with more control. For clicks, it's great. For taps, which I turn off, it's not as great, according to those who prefer that - appears to be a software issue.PortsThere's one less Thunderbolt/USB-C port than before, but 50% more bandwidth (3 controllers instead of 2).The HDMI is 2.0, can drive up to 4K HDR @60Hz.The SD card reader is shallow, so the cards stick out. There might be room for a flush micro-SD adapter. I only have cards up to 64GB, which work fine. Some people have had trouble reading some cards, so it may be finicky.Battery LifeI usually keep plugged in, but the reviews I've seen that cover battery life tests typically say it's the longest of any similar machine they've tested, including PCs. Reports of battery life for office work, browsing, watching videos, and so on generally range from 10 to 16 hours, sometimes more. It can go unusually long with heavy use too, 5 hours or more of video work, for example. Max Tech did 10 benchmark and stress tests with it in a couple hours, some maxing out the CPU or GPU for up to ten minutes, and it still had 36% left.At normal settings, there's no performance hit until you get down to 3%; until then you can process or game at full tilt. There's a low-power mode that extends battery life by limiting performance, lowering screen brightness, etc. The Max also has a high-power mode, but it seems to only ramp up the fans sooner to help cooling. Apple's description and tests in reviews indicate it doesn't affect performance in any direct way.The Max has tended to have a little less battery life than the Pro in reviews. The only good tests I've seen that compared directly either found negligible differences or up to 15% less battery life for the Max. (Other tests haven't been well controlled.)You can quick charge to 50% in a half-hour. The new power brick is 45% more powerful than before, and maybe 30% larger lengthwise, still small for what it does. You can charge at lower speed with smaller bricks (not included) via the USB-C ports.Size and WeightIt's noticeably heavier than before, about 5 ounces over the previous 16"", and not quite as sleek, but it's sleeker than I was expecting from the photos.RepairabilityHa ha! But really, it's better than it was. Battery modules now have pull tabs so they can be more easily replaced. The screen can be replaced more easily, but if Apple doesn't do it you lose True Tone (which I don't want anyway). The headphone, Thunderbolt and MagSafe ports can be replaced without replacing the logic board. Now rates a 4/10 from iFixit for repairability, up from 1/10 for the previous model.CompatibilityComes with Rosetta 2, which enables M1 Macs to use programs written for Intel Macs, and usually works very well.There's no more Boot Camp, so to run Windows or Windows programs you have to use third-party software like Parallels, which runs Windows by emulating a Windows machine (and requires a Windows license), or Crossover, which modifies Windows programs to run on Macs.  Which works best, or at all, depends on the program.GamingWoW *mostly* runs 50 to 120fps at high settings and resolution, depending on the location. Some places can't even manage 50 at those settings, though, but do OK at more compromised settings. Baldur's Gate 3, Diablo III, CS:GO and several others can run at 60-100fps or better at good settings.You can play Windows games via Parallels or Crossover. They generally don't run as well, but some do fine.Most games, including native ones, run quite a bit better on the Max, with up to 2x the fps. Final Fantasy XIV is hit and miss at good settings even with the Max.Gaming isn't usually hot or noisy, can get warmer with light fans for the games that aren't running natively. And there's no noticeable performance hit for gaming on battery.WorkI have to mention the less fun part: how well this does things you might have to do at work. It does almost all of it better than before, much of it way better. Here's how it compares according to actual test results from numerous sources with Xcode, Logic Pro, Lightroom, Blender, Final Cut Pro, Premiere Pro, and so on. The range of comparison depends on what the task is.Previous base MBP 16"" (Intel i7 AMD 5300): The Pro is 60% to several times faster.Previous top-spec'd MBP (i9 5600M): The Pro is about the same to 2 or 3 times faster.Regular M1 machines (not M1 Pro or Max): The Pro is about the same to several times faster.The 14"" M1 Pro with same specs: The same, though the 16"" has the bigger battery and heat removal system, so it fares better in those ways.Windows laptop work stations: This is complicated, but the Pro can thrash most Windows laptops in most intensive work-related apps. It lines up very roughly with machines with a good i7/i9 and an RTX 3070, but generally can't keep up with the RTX 3080. The Pro uses a fraction of the power, and so only produces a fraction of the heat and noise, if any. And lasts and performs much better on battery.Pro vs MaxThe Max is about the same to twice as fast as the Pro, mostly between those extremes. The CPU is much the same, but the GPU is double the cores, so the main advantage is in graphics-heavy work.Besides the GPU cores, the Max has twice the bandwidth for memory transfer, two hardware video encode engines instead of one, and some extra cooling capacity.If you're already successfully using a Mac laptop, you don't *need* the Max, since the Pro is already better than what you have. But that doesn't mean you can't benefit from the Max's extra power if you have the money. For intensive video editing, massive photo editing, or better gaming (though cheaper Windows machines will play most games better), the Max has real advantages.To confuse things a little more, Apple (but not Amazon currently) also offers a demi-Max with a 24-core GPU, halfway between the Pro's 16 and the Max's 32. It's a cheaper way to get the extra bandwidth, video encoder, and cooling advantages of the Max. Tests show that in graphics-intensive tasks it operates roughly midway between the Pro and 32-core Max, often more than half, as expected.WarrantiesThis comes with a one-year limited warranty against manufacturing defects that includes free phone support for the first 90 days. If you want to also cover accidental damage (with deductibles) and extend the regular warranty and free tech support to 3 years, you can buy 

AppleCare+ from Amazon

   (link embedded) or Apple. You get 60 days from purchase to buy it, but coverage for accidents doesn't start until you do. (I always self-insure when I can, so I didn't get it.)DecalsLast and least, this comes with two black Apple decals, the sign of true professional Apple equipment."
1179,Out of the box unusable for me. This MacBook Pro does not have any USB ports to be able to restore from a previous Mac back up that’s on an external drive. You must buy an adapter. Since I live in a remote area I’d have to order online and wait. You cannot even plug a iPhone12 Pro Max directly into it. The only ports it has are thunderbolt. So even Apple’s own lighting connector needs an adapter. The keyboard is a downgrade from the old keyboard. Solid black plastic instead of plastic keys surrounded by aluminum which were easier to see. Had to call Apple support to download an update because there is no reset option in the System Preferences of OS Monterey. And the update did not work to give it that option. Will have to figure out a different option to remove my account and information to return it. This particular MacBook is defective I believe.
1180,I ordered the 2021 16 inch right away as I knew they would probably sell out fast. I had to make sure I had one for my trip I am leaving on soon.  As soon as I opened it the screen would never come on.  Thought maybe it needed charging so I tried that.  Still nothing but a black screen.  It kept making the sound when you open it up even when it was closed over and over again.  I took it to the local Apple Store hoping I could get some answers.  They tired to get it to work and could not either.  They said it is very strange and maybe something happened to it during shipping.  They said since it is brand new it would be best to get my money back from Amazon.  I thought maybe I could just exchange it before my trip but the one I ordered is out of stock.  I will try the 14 inch and see if I like it compared to the size of the 16 inch since it is in stock.  This is a first MacBook Pro I have ever purchased and now I am a bit nervous.
1181,"Here are the temperature results for the new cool MacBooks compared to the old overheating intel ones. 91 degrees for the old one near the processor, and 74 degrees on the new ones. Both had been running for hours transferring files nonstop. Amazing. I have been editing video, transferring large files and not once have the fans kicked on. Makes me want to cry."
1182,"Finally, this 2021 MacBook Pro cured my depression!"
1183,Arrived DOA - wouldn’t start up. Spent hours on the phone with Apple support and still wouldn’t start. Returned - c’mon man!
1184,"This laptop is unbelievably fast. Between the screen, battery life, and performance, this laptop is head and shoulders better than any competition."
1185,My first ever MacBook. Switched over from PC and I can't believe I didn't switch sooner! On the pricer side but I'm super happy with my purchase!
1186,"I have been using my MacBook Pro from 2014 for work until last week when I finally purchased this MacBook Pro. My old MacBook starts up and works as fast as the day I bought it. The only reason I bought a new MacBook was because the battery life was getting low. I probably could have just bought a new battery and it would have been fine.That being said, I did hold out for this MacBook because Apple brought back the ports that I needed. I use the HDMI and SD ports daily. An Ethernet port would have been nice but that’s asking too much. This MacBook has a 2 day battery life and is blazing fast. I use Adobe programs and this MacBook doesn’t even blink when I do live editing. Best laptop I have ever used.I own a business that uses many PC laptops and a couple MacBooks. A PC will never last as long as a MacBook. And, a PC ALWAYS gets slower after 6 months of use. The price is high but you can buy a new PC every 2 years or a MacBook every 7 years."
1187,"Coming from a 2019 16in, I feel that this generation is 2 steps forwards, 1 step back.Pros:-Fans are never audible even under full extended load!  This was my #1 issue with my 2019 mac which would have constant fan noise with 2 monitors.-2x battery life-Better screen especially in dark environment or a dark subject-Extremely fast for certain workloads such as video editing and code compilation.-magsafe is back (although I personally don't care for it)-most apps work normally with rosetta emulation, but may have some stutter.Cons:-thicker and SIGNIFICANTLY heavier.-Screen has a notch which is very distracting for me.-Still has some compatibility issues.-Terrible for games.  Only a few titles are supported natively.  I only tested league of legends(uses rosetta emulator), but it was choppy and 1/3 the fps of my 2019 intel macbook.- +$300 base price even though they got rid of intel.-The area I feel apple has made a major misstep is with ports.  I couldn't care less for SD card or HDMI, but everyone who buys this is going to need USB-A.  It's ridiculous that I still have to bring a dongle everywhere just to use my mouse but these ports I never/rarely use are back.Also some developer related tools/libraries aren't working.C# debugger is totally unsupported for example.  Anything that requires gpu hardware acceleration (pytorch) is unlikely to ever be supported in any usable form.  Linux dual boot is unsupported or in early experimental stages.  I also had issues building/running java projects natively, but no issues with rosetta.If you're looking to buy this for an undergrad program, it's probably workable.  However, I'd suggest saving some $ and getting a used mac or windows machine.  Professional devs will be aware of their specific requirements, but I suspect many will need to keep a secondary x86 machine for the foreseeable future."
1188,"I am writing this review focused primarily on people who are considering jumping from the 13"" MacBook Pro to the 14"" MacBook Pro, which is what I did. I moved from the 13"" MacBook Pro M1 with 16gb of RAM to the 14"" MacBook Pro M1 Pro with 16gb of RAM.Size: So, 1"" of screen might not seem like a lot on its face, but the difference is pretty substantial, in my opinion. Even the pictures don't quite do it justice. The screen feels considerably larger in a package that isn't considerably larger. For me, it's the perfect sweet spot for someone who wants something larger than the 13"" model, but smaller than the 16"". I had a 16"" MacBook Pro i9 and it was just too much for me. This one feels perfect.Form Factor: The new 14"" and 16"" MacBooks both adopt a thicker chassis, which is shown in the pictures. As such, Apple decided to make the casing flat instead of gently rounded. It honestly reminds me of the pre-unibody builds, but still sleek and modern. If I didn't know this one was new and you just laid them side-by-side, I might say that the old form factor looks a little newer, but that isn't to say that it looks bad.Aesthetics: Overall, I touched on the aesthetics a bit in the ""form factor"" section. It looks like a high-end laptop, but at the same time I can see some people thinking it looks dated. I personally like the flatter look over the more rounded look, but it will depend on the person. Another thing I like is moving the ""MacBook Pro"" branding from under the screen to the bottom of the casing. I just think it provides a cleaner look during use. The black background of the keyboard is also a plus for me. The old space gray background was fine, but I really like the black.Function: Most people probably won't notice a massive difference in the previous iteration and the new iteration. For the 14"" and 16"" MacBook Pros, the touchbar has been removed. This will make a lot of people happy. For me, I was always pretty ambivalent about the touchbar, but I'm not going to complain about a key row there. The keyboard appears to have ever so slightly more travel and bounce. It's not a huge amount, but it is noticeable. I'll touch on The Notch later.Performance: My 13"" had the M1 chip and now my 14"" as the M1 Pro. So far, I haven't noticed a tremendous difference when using programs like Logic Pro, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Lightroom, but I wouldn't say those are super intensive programs. If you're exporting massive 8K videos, you might want to jump up to the M1 Max. One thing I have noticed is that the thermals are maybe a little bit worse. Just a touch. I have noticed it warming up a bit, but the fan still has not come on once. I only mention this because my 13"" M1 stayed cold at all times. It's not as bad as my i9, which sounded like a jet engine revving up while it jumped well over 100 degrees, but it's something to be aware of.The Notch: Honestly, so much has been made of the notch and I think it's mostly overstated. Yes, it's fun to meme the fact that Apple still hasn't found a way around the notch, particularly on iPhones, but it's really not a huge deal. Were it up to me, I would have just left a bezel up there, but I can understand why Apple didn't. I use a Dell XPS for work and it has razor thin bezels with no notch, but at the same time the camera is an absolute joke. Looks like it's from 2002.The Notch (cont'd): The notch behavior can be inconsistent from app to app, but not to the point where it's bothersome. I have seen some programs with very large nav menus up top bump the status bar out of the way to make room. And while this particular phenomenon is not something new for MacBooks, losing a big chunk of that bar to the notch will likely make this a more regular occurrence for people. Do I wish it didn't have a notch? Yeah, probably. Does it hurt the experience? Very, very little.Screen: For everyday indoor use, which is almost exclusively what I do, I think you will be hard-pressed to find a better screen on the market. The 120Hz refresh rate is something I waited a long time to get on the iPhone, so I was pretty shocked to see it implemented on the new MacBook Pros just a month later. It actually has more pixels/inch than the iMac 27"" 5K screen, which I also use pretty regularly. All-in-all, the screen is just the best in the business.Overall: It's a great and powerful laptop for someone who is wanting a little more than web surfing and word processing. I use mine primarily for recording music, as well as live performances using standalone plugins, so I need something that is powerful and easy to use. The MacBook Pro has always fit the bill, but now with the M1, M1 Pro, and M1 Max chips, I have absolutely no concern for performance or consistency.My 13"" M1 did just what I needed in this regard, but I'm someone who wanted a slightly larger screen without drastically increasing my footprint and weight. The 14"" MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip is just what I needed. If you're someone who needs absolutely top notch performance, I'd recommend upgrading the RAM and going with the M1 Max."
1189,"I haven't upgraded my computer for more than a decade, so it would stand to reason any recent releases would impress me, but this macbook pro has gone above and beyond in the small time I've had it.The screen is truly something to behold. Smooth, clear, just beautiful. I don't typically care about bezels, but I might start. The expanded screen makes an unexpected difference. Meanwhile, I barely notice the notch. Apple said they'd find workarounds to make it scarce, and they have.The speakers are wonderful as well. I was skeptical at first -- thought I caught some tinny effects on a couple songs, but the more I listen to them, the more I'm convinced the tinniness was in the recording (it was a live album, which might explain it). As for the spatial audio, I've only heard a couple songs, but it's pretty trippy. This is my first experience with it, and it doesn't disappoint.In the short time I've had the computer, it's been nothing but fast. Probably more computer than I need, so if you're a sound editor or photographer, this review probably isn't for you. But for those of you casual users who want a solid machine that will last (as I said, my last macbook pro made it more than a decade), this is the one. Excited as I was for my last macbook, I could see room for improvement at the time. Right now, I don't see how things get better than this."
1190,"M1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. Compared to previous MacBook Pro, it's a giant leap ahead. These tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the Macbook. This particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro,  but it still kicks butt. You can get the Pro Max chip and bump up the RAM to 64GB if you want - and add tons more storage. The 14 inch MacBook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. It can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. The display is stunning. Just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. The brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. Real HDR viewing -  a big difference. You will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. After 10 minutes I don't even notice it. It means nothing for your experience. Its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. Camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous MacBooks. Six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. Music/movies it feels like surround sound. For video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. The keyboard is a dream to type on. Very solid like all MacBooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. The Apple Magic Keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. Battery life is amazing. I have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. At best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! Especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it won't be 17 hours but I did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. The power efficiency is ground breaking. They have added back the MagSafe power plug - which is great! And added back an SD card slot and and an HDMI port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. I wish it had at least one USB-A old style port - but it doesn't. You get three USB-C thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. They got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro MacBooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. Apparently they listened to a lot of users who didn't really like the touch pad. The shape and style of this laptop is great. Some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. That is BS. I have been typing most of the day and I don't feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. Very comfy for typing. Some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new Macbook Pro, but I am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside -  this is an amazing laptop - the best Apple has ever made, hands down. And I would say you won't find a better power laptop anywhere.  All that said - this is not a gamers machine. Apple is not for hard core gamers. I mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. I am a hard core gamer and a PC geek  - I have a powerful windows PC for gaming. And always will. But for everything else. this MacBook is king. I use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. I can plut into a giant monitor if I want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch IPS panel. So if you are wondering if this Macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - I am here to tell you, its the real deal. I finally upgraded from my 2015 MacBook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. If you are thinking of getting one - you won't be disappointed. One last comment. I am an old timer windows guy, and I know all the counter arguments for the Mac. Many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. First, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new M1 Pro chips - you can't. And aside from that, the Mac OS is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text FROM A PHOTO! Whaaat? And the design/ergonomics/quality of these MacBooks is unmatched. So, yes you pay more - but you get more. My last MacBook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. If you want this laptop - get it! It rocks."
1191,"I have a Mabook Pro covered by Apple care. The computer needs a new battery. To make a long story short Apple left me for months with a computer, again under warranty, which I can use for a couple of hours for simple tasks like web browsing before it needs to be recharged. Apple refused to replace the battery because the diagnostic read 81% not below 80 % as per policy. In all this Apple didn’t have any problems asking me to invest countless hours of my time between doing clean installs trips to apple stores etc.. I feel a more respectful way to treat me as a loyal customer could have been let us replace the battery first and if that doesn’t fix the issue which I seriously doubt ask me to do troubleshooting. All this to save something that would probably cost you few $$. Seriously ?"
1192,sent me base model
1193,"I probably got a faulty laptop but the charger status doesn’t show it’s charging when plugged in, only thing indicating that it’s charging is the orange light. My chrome windows keeps crashing whenever I put the computer to sleep and the external video display rarely connects"
1194,"I never write reviews, but feel compelled to write one for this Macbook Pro. I've owned macs consistently since 1990s and have dealt with eye strain on the air and now on this laptop. It gave me horrible headaches and eye strain even with a matte protector. I returned it and am now looking at PCs for the first time because if I can't read from the screen without it making me sick, I can't use it."
1195,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   My first MacBook ever! I had been saving up for it before the official drop— & I was not disappointed! Love the Touch ID feature, and it’s so efficient! Can’t wait to use it when I go back to school!"
1196,"This laptop has a superior display, superior speakers, superior camera and an excellent keyboard. Don't go cheap and buy the ""affordable"" MacBook Air base model like some of these talking heads have been advising. It's not a good buy if you are unhappy with it after six months, and believe me, you will be unhappy with 8 GB of RAM and two USB ports after six months. M1 MacBooks are not upgradeable so if you find that you need more RAM, you are stuck. Unless all you are doing sending emails, tweets, and watching TicTok, you will probably need something more, especially if you are using your laptop for work. I'm using my MacBook Pro with an LG UltraFine 5K 27 inch display as my desktop system, which replaces a 27 inch iMac. I'm very happy."

   Sheeeese! What can I say? Apple has done it again 🤪😍 magnificent piece of device I must say."
1198,"I pulled the trigger on this thing hoping that the bad reviews were wrong.. some of the comments saying it came dirty and defective definitely gave me pause however, what arrived today was practically a brand new macbook. the device does not show any signs of wear and the battery cycle count is 18, it came with the original power brick and while the cable was used, it was not worn or dirty in any way. While i've only just started using the device about an hour ago, I can tell you that it's speedy and works flawlessly... had I not known it was a refurb when buying it, I would have easily confused it for a brand new mbp.. for those asking, this is a 2017 macbook pro and the specs as quoted are accurate. i'll play around with this thing for a little while and update this review as needed, but so far this looks like a winner!***update***A few months in and it’s still working flawlessly. I don’t regret my purchase for one second, and neither should you!"
1199,This is not a 256GB MacBook Pro- they are falsely advertising it as such and then shipping buyers 128GB versions.
1200,"Came in used and dirty, and it was not even turn off, I'm gonna return it. So disappointed."
1201,"Wow. I cant say enough how happy I am with this laptop! I it arrived early, and for a refurbished computer I swear it doesn't have a scratch, dent, smudge or single flaw anywhere on it! Its fast, the battery is great, its working perfectly! I couldn't be happier with this thing!"
1202,"Was excited to receive it and on the outside it had one noticable chip in the case on the cover side (which had a sharp edge to it), but thought that isn't too bad.  But when opening it up the screen in both the top left and top right were broken/chipped/cracked like it had been dropped and they replaced the cover, but not the screen.  This was not acceptable.  Wanted to try it out and ended up learning that some of the keys did not work right (sticky, pushed strange and such), plus the touchpad/mouse was really strange and didn't seem to work correctly.  Too many issues out of the box for me and too concerned that there might be other issues from where it looked to have been dropped and such.  Sending it back and just started that process.  So far the return seems ok....but just hate that the product does not match the description...using their words ""Renewed products work and look like new""."
1203,"I ordered the space gray with 256 gb of ram and received a silver with 128gb.  I knew this could happen as the picture did not match the description and I had seen other similar reviews.The good news is it was on time and in flawless condition.  I think I will stick with it and not press my luck, as it is still a fair price and a great machine, but beware."
1204,"I have to admit, I don't typically write reviews and I was a little hesistant about the product due to some 1 to two star reviews. The space gray model not only is at a great price, it came to me brand new. With all the specs I was expecting, i5 8GB RAM 256GB SSD, and works like a dream. Battery life is great, setting up was easy, and all my Apple Products (iPhone, Apple watch, Earpods) synced with no issues. I'm not sure as to why there were so many negative reviews, but mine is not one of them. SO HAPPY!! I truly recommend."
1205,the battery is dead
1206,"This product arrived quickly and looked great.  There have been multiple glitches with the power switch and with the screen ever since it's arrival.  Most of the time the power button would require multiple attempts to push before the computer would power up.  When the computer woke from sleep state (opening lid after its been closed for at least fifteen minutes) the screen would be black and then all pixelated.  Most recently, the computer wouldn't even turn on, when it finally did, it was all reset and all the settings were reset.  I lost everything I had put on the computer over the past day.  The seller still hasn't gotten back to me after email and I left a voice message.  I have now initiated a return as I want my money back.  It would have been nice if they had gotten back to me ASAP when I emailed or when I called (during normal hours of operation, by the way) and it went to voicemail.  The fact that they didn't and the computer kept coming up with other issues.  I now will buy a new one.  The value is not there with the aggravation generated."
1207,"Multiple reviews mentioned getting devices with used batteries, screen issues, etc.My laptop arrived through FedEx Express with questionable packaging. But everything was intact and fine. The laptop still had the plastic wrapped around it as MacBooks directly from Apple do, even with the screen cover. Only 3 battery cycles out of the box, with a new charger in the box. I am very satisfied with the purchase although in the Q&A section of this product someone mentions that this is a 2018 model, its not, its a 2017 (At least the one I received.) which for me isn't really a big deal since it arrived in exceptional condition. Highly recommend this MacBook."
1208,I'm a fan of apple products and I like almost everything about this new MBA. But it has one huge flaw that nobody talks about. It's the camera hardware and it hasn't been updated in ages. My zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light. A $1000 laptop with 10 year old front camera is unacceptable. Camera is very important to me. Especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time.
1209,"Liked:- Long battery life (one charge WILL last all day, i.e. 16 hours. Personally tested true)- Speed (the new M1 processor really is fast)- Quiet (no fan but the laptop still does not get hot)- Light and portable- High resolution & bright displayDisliked:- As with other MacBooks, the keyboard is mediocre especially compared to laptops like Lenovo Thinkpad- Incompatible applications (With the M1 processor still being new, you might experience existing programs frequently crash. For example, Chrome keeps crashing) But I would guess there will be a fix soon"
1210,"UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable.The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long.Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using ""swap memory"" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board.***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB.I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models.There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD.***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly.------I purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12"" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1.The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco.I likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive ""Pro Apps"" running at the same time.I would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.I would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball ""not responding"" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1. If however, you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable, faster and cooler running than the Intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable Mac."
1211,"The M1 chip really is amazing. But it only lasted five days for me. Somehow mine managed to break after using a third party USB C hub. The screen wouldn’t turn on at all, and an Apple repair tech couldn’t figure it out after doing a few quick tests. Oh and then Apple said it would take a month to replace it with a new one."
1212,"Beautiful laptop. I’ve upgraded from the MacBook Air of old...so far this laptop has blown it away. It wasn’t overly pricey to be honest and I feel it’s worth the price. Overall look is great and keyboard feel is nice. Larger touchpad is great, I’ve paired my Magic Trackpad 2 with it as well."
1213,"I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13"" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13"" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.Good:- SCREEN looks great!  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  I usually don't go above 50% brightness.- KEYBOARD is good.  Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard.  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic.  Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great.  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.- LOOKS GREAT.  Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.- NO FAN.  That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.- PERFORMANCE.  It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time.  For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU.  Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27"" (top end) with Intel chips.- TOUCH ID is great still.  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons.  On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA.  Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch).  You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay.  And so on and so forth.- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.NOT GOOD:- WEBCAM still sucks.  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc.  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27"" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera).- ONLY 2 PORTS.  Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort).  Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame.  I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.OVERALL:A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem.  Love it so far!"
1214,No complains so far.  Very fast and performs great.  I had a 2014 MacBook Air and finally upgraded this year.  This is leagues beyond that entry and I’m very happy with this upgrade.
1215,"Lightweight, blazing fast, easy to use, battery life is incredible with the new Apple M1 chip.  A typical Great Apple product.However, there is only a Thunderbolt port, so you now have to go out and buy a cable to convert USB to thunderbolt (if you want to use a backup hard drive) or other USB items, AND, I had to buy yet another cable to sync my phone's lightning port to the thunderbolt port on the computer. Total $56.I LOVE Apple product, and worked for them in my caerer, but I would wait on buying this version until the software for it has been developed.UPDATE: After several months of using this computer, I have have found several things of concern:1.  my notification center keeps disappearing, despite my constant reinstalling the widgets.2.  my computer's calendar, reminders, and photo stream do not sync with my IOS devices (iPhone & iPad).  If I add an item to calendar on my phone, it will appear on my mac but not vice versa.  Reminders will not sync regardless of which device I originate the item on.I have contacted Apple support on all these issues and they cannot solve the problem.IT APPEARS THAT THE BUGS HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED OUT, YET.  THINGS ARE MADDENINGLY CLUNKY!"

   Bought this laptop bc i needed it for spring semester and i needed an upgrade from my heavy macbook pro. I go to work too so i needed something super light and thin i can just bring everywhere and slide it in my bag.I am obsessed with how fast this macbook is. The battery life is on point. I used it for movies and series at work and it lasted for 3 days. The processor is definitely sooo good. I open so many tabs at once and it has not lagged on me. The keyboard and trackpad is responsive.I love the color. The main reason why i bought this too. 😍😂I have no problems with it at all.Highly recommend"
1217,Opened my brand new $1000++ computer and the entire screen was cracked and destroyed. Awesome! Thanks Amazon.
1218,"Delivered to me within 12 hours of purchase... Sealed in original apple packaging with protective film, blemish free, not a scratch.. Mint.its powerful, Ive already loaded some big task audio software and broadcast software on it and its flying through the multiple processes together at ease... (Logic 10.5 / Traktor DJ 3.0 / OBS)Super light and portable, If this is a MacBook Pro then I can't even imagine how light the Air models are. Nor could I even imagine why you may need something more powerful. I am having to adjust to the new keyboard and Touch Bar, I keep hitting Siri and volume settings, even as I type this.id also recommend getting a keyboard cover as well.... I hear these keyboards go out sometimes and to repair it. This is no fault to the reseller, but I can't believe Apple with their price points don't offer a bigger SSD for the lowest price point.... 128gb is laughable so be prepared to buy an external SSD along with a Thunderbolt 3 / USB-C Hub to run hdmi, and various external accessories.Overall I love this computer so far, it was a nail biter as I rarely ever shell out $1,000 on anything but I'm very pleased and satisfied with my purchase. And I still cannot find a better deal on the internet, not even used on Facebook marketplace, letgo or craigslist....Five stars"
1219,So not worth it. All they want to do is take your money do NOT BUY THIS ONE! Its used and if you search apple on amazon they have brand new with higher stats for cheaper.
1220,"Just received this, but so far so good. It looks BRAND NEW. There are literally NO signs of cosmetic wear or damage. It arrived in a sealed apple box. I’m finishing setting up and I already love it. For just under $1,200 for a 2019 model, this is a GREAT deal!"
1221,"I really love my MacBook. I really love this laptop. I'm a huge MacBook fan and this works like new. So far I don't have a problem with the butterfly keyboard, but I heard bad reviews about the keyboard from watching YouTube videos. I think that they may have fixed the keyboard problem when they refurbished the product??? I'm not sure, but honestly this a really great laptop for a really great price. I do wish that it came in the original Apple box and packaging, but it wasn't far from the really deal."
1222,"It looks and feels brand spanking new! Definitely happy with my purchase considering that I bought a brand new 2020 MacBook Air and hated it. Returned it back in 2 days. I paid a lot less for the Pro than the Air and its A LOT better with so many features. I’m not trying to persuade anyone out of getting the Air but if you are considering on buying a MacBook my advice would be to just go ahead and get the pro. The Air reminds me of a google chrome book slapped with an Apple logo on it. Not saying that google chrome books are bad, but there’s no need to pay a full band for the Air when you could find something similar and a lot cheaper. All in all I really love this laptop."
1223,"Bought this laptop with some apprehensions, as i have typically bought refurbished goods from apple directly. This was my first from amazon, and i was not disappointed. The notebook was flawless, not a single scratch on it. second, all the accessories where flawless as well, not signs of usage. When i powered on the notebook to verify usage, the battery had cycled only 3 times, meaning it was still in new condition. Very highly recommended seller. Thanks for a pleasant transaction."
1224,"This laptop looked new, straight from Apple store."
1225,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   The screen arrived damaged, what a scam.!"
1226,"Although I was very skeptical about purchasing a ""refurbished"" MacPro, after reading the reviews for this company, I made the purchase.  The MacPro arrived earlier than expected, expertly wrapped, included Apple certified, and in NEW condition.  There is no way I could tell it was not new or refurbished.  The price was the best I could find after researching other sellers.  I would highly recommend iPower Resale Inc to anyone looking for a MacPro.  Their customer service is exceptional.  Thank you for a great product!  5*****"
1227,"When I looked at this product it only had one review and it was a bad one... I then checked all the other products the seller sold and the reviews were excellent, needless to say I took a chance and ordered this MacBook Pro 2019. It arrived before anticipated and it was securely package. I AM SO GLAD I took a chance on them because this MacBook is amazing! Now I’ve waited a couple months before reviewing it to make sure it works. The MacBook looks brand new, it didn’t have any dents or scratches. It works and performs like a new MacBook. I had to contact the seller over the a small issue with the charger and they went above and beyond to correct the issue.Excellent customer service excellent product. I recommend this seller to anyone!"
1228,"I got my new MacBook Pro M1 two weeks ago and could not be more happy with it. This machine is absolutely incredible in terms of speed, looks, weight/size, display, and battery life - and texture (it feels so good against the skin on my wrists as I type) and basically anything else you can think of. I also love the space gray color, the new keyboard, the Touch Bar, and the larger trackpad. There are so many options to customize the system to work just the way I like.My previous MacBook was the 2011 model and it still works today, but after 10 years it became too slow and the trackpad had trouble clicking, so after a TON of research, I decided to pull the trigger and get the New MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.A couple suggestions I am able to give after spending almost two months and probably over 30 hours researching the new MacBook are: go with the standard model of 8gb of RAM and the 256 ssd - you can get this on Amazon for $1239 vs $1299 at Apple - so you get to save 60 bucks, and you have the added satisfaction of not having to deal with the snobby nerd losers that work in the Apple Store, who asked me rudely when I went in to get a new laptop ""umm, do you have an appointment? Well, you're going to have to make an appointment if you want to go in the store"". I love Apple products and will never use another phone or computer besides the iPhone and MacBook, but after that experience I will never again give my business to the physical Apple Stores. I mean, seriously, do you really need me to make an appointment to buy a $1300 laptop? Whatever dude.Anyway, in several YouTube videos that compared the 8GB ram model along side the 16GB ram model (costs 200 bucks more), the 8GB performed just as well in nearly every task - and they really pushed it to the limits. The only reason to pay up for the 16GB RAM is if you want to edit 8K UHD videos or are a super serious music recording artist or highly advanced professional photographer - and even then it's not too much of a difference. For the every day user (me or basically anyone who is not a computer professional) the 8GB working with this new M1 chip is mind-blowing, blows any other laptop on the market completely out of the water, and actually even performs just as well as the $2200 15 inch MacBook Pro using the Intel chip. As far as the storage goes, 256 ssd is standard - that's what I got - and you can pay 200 bucks more for 512 ssd or 400 bucks more for 1 TB. But with the Cloud storage available now, you don't really need to keep much on the laptop drive, you can just save it to the cloud.Overall I honestly could go on for hours about every little detail that I absolutely love about this machine. A free one year subscription to Apple TV is also another little perk. But I am still mystified every day at how incredible this machine is. I've been online for over 3 hours now and its still on 92% battery. The new Retina display is brilliant. Everything is perfect. I truly am in love this laptop and would recommend that anyone looking for a new laptop to last a long time and outperform everything else on the market gets the new matchbook 13 inch M1."
1229,I bought my Mac from Apple directly not from Amazon. This thing is amazing. Battery life is awesome. Hard to believe that I can work with it all day and do not have to charge at all even with bright screen.No issues with speed at all. I use Matlab a lot and this computer is even slightly faster than my desktop with 12 core AMD CPU and 32 GB ram.Excellent machine. Happy I bought it.
1230,"I own over 50 computers and it blows away my 11th gen Dell XPS 13 i7, My surface Book 3, my Ryzen 7 Thinkpad. the first week I got it the battery lasted for 5 days and 22 hrs of use and still had 20% left. I felt guilty and charged it. The Geekbench 5 rating beat all those listed laptops and they had 16 or 32GB of memory and the MacBook Pro M1 had only 8GB of unified memory. The keyboard felt great, the sound was superb, the screen bright, and it was blazing fast in all I did. I'm an IT consultant and deal in Windows based databases and this Mac has now become my daily go to system at home. It has become my new front end."
1231,It's a Mac once you go Mac you never go back. This is my second Mac my first lasted almost 9 years.
1232,Dead at arrival.... kernel error. Took it to the Apple store they told me looks like a hardware failure and to send it back to Amazon.
1233,"I'm going to preface this review with the 1 thing I dislike so we can get that out of the way.I mean let's be honest, that's what most people are looking for when buying a product-the down sides.It has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack EVEN THOUGH apple quit using that on it's handheld products years ago.Not that I care, it's good that they include the 3.5mm jack-but how come they didn't include one for their lightning connector that their headphones come in out of the box? Forces you to either change to a standard headphone jack or BT headphones (probably trying to push their AirPods line).Other than that, I have no issues. It's fast, efficient, reliable and easy to use. If your familiar with iOS on these then it'll be a great addition to the tech team you have at home."
1234,"I love my new MacBook Pro!!  It’s the 13” and not too small. It’s very lightweight!  It’s so fast!  I was using an older MacBook Pro from mid 2012. It worked well, just so slow. This one flies!!  I was disappointed that there are no USB ports or CD player. I spent about $65 at Best Buy and got an adapter that works very well!!!"
1235,The battery lasts forever and its fast. My last macbook had a pretty good battery and worked very well for years too.The M1 does allow for dual external monitors and there are two usbc ports total. These two things can be worked around with dongles and a video hub but now I have $200 worth of accessories and a tangled mess on my desk.How is a 2020 Mac not compatible with dual monitors but my 2005 HP works great with the same monitor setup?!? I really can't get past that.Get the intel version with 4 USB ports and you can use it in your Covid home office out of the box.
1236,"There is no fix for this, and now it can't be returned.  All that money wasted!!! There is a vertical black line on the screen.  I tried to fix it using tips from youtube videos and none of it worked.  Proceed with caution!"
1237,"I really wanted to love this laptop. I've had only Macs for years. This was supposed to be an upgrade from my 2014 MacBook Air. I previously had a 2020 16"" intel based MacBook Pro for work configured with two HP monitors. No issues with the monitors and connected instantly with zero effort to get the screens to work with the laptop. Bought this one and connected to my Belkin hub for the HDMIs. Would only connect a single monitor. Googled the issue and found that the new M1 apple chip only supports a single monitor. News to me and I guess I should have researched more. However the low rating stems from the fact that this is a PRO laptop. A professional would want two monitors and should not have to google whether a PRO laptop supports more than 1 monitor when the intel version does seamlessly. Despite this I had planned to keep it and just deal with 1 monitor because of the cost savings over buying the Intel based MacBook Pro and wanted the longer battery life. Now brings me to the issue that made me return the laptop. This laptop just would not configure to show a clear resolution with my monitors. The scale was off and the display just stayed blurry no matter what setting I changed it to on the monitor or the laptop's settings. Tried and tried and just gave up. Returned this and ordered an Intel based 13"" MacBook Pro. No issues, supports dual monitors, and seamlessly integrated to the laptop. No blurry screen and no having to set or change any settings to get it to work. I am floored that Apple would produce a Pro for business that only supports a single monitor. I love Apple but will not buy anything with their chip until the kinks are worked out."
1238,This is by far the best laptop ive ever owned! The laptop came with 0 scratches and only 16 battery charges on it. It even came with the apple box and stickers! Highly reccomend for the price. $850 is great for a 2019 macbook air.
1239,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Everything I expected and more! Just like brand new!"
1240,I love this laptop so so much. I think everyone should get it. The model is between 2018-2020 and the one I got had the Touch ID on it! Everything was very easy to set up and is in such great quality!
1241,"Received in a timely manner.  Will review in a couple weeks.Well, it's been over 2 weeks since receiving my MacBook Air and I have to admit that it has proven to be worth it's price. The Retina display is phenomenal and it's compact chassis is just what I was looking for. I am not a power user, so I didn't need major memory capacity. The speakers are, surprisingly, crisp and clear for such a slim build. The fingerprint scanner is quick and a huge convenience. I am (or was) a long-time PC user and resisted getting an Apple, but the transition was smooth and Apple's claim to fame for being user-friendly and intuitive proved true. If you are looking for a compact, yet capable laptop with QWERTY keyboard, I would recommend this product."
1242,"After having the laptop a few months, I can say my leap of faith to buy an amazon refurbished was worth it BUT I had to work a little bit.  It didn't arrive perfect and it still isn't perfect.  There is a tiny white dot on the screen where some pixels died (I guess) and when I first got it, I had to call Apple support to get iMessage and Facetime to work on it.  Then I had to take it to the Apple store to get the keyboard fixed as some keys would not work.  Thankfully, I had Apple Care on it so the cost to get it shipped off and fixed wasn't bad.  Overall, I am happy with my purchase and I recommend this seller, but I will probably buy new next time."
1243,"** I have only had the laptop for a week, this review is only based off of the time I have had it**I was so nervous to buy a refurbished computer but this came like it was brand new. New packaging, new charger, spotless laptop. I was worried the battery would be bad and wouldn’t hold a charge. I was wrong. I downloaded over 12,000 photos and was on it nonstop for over 2 days without even having to charge it. I am in love with this!!!"
1244,"As in the description exactly, thank the seller for the fast shipping and good packaging"
1245,I love this laptop and I’m really happy with all the features. Would definitely recommend.
1246,Exactly as expected. Great value.
1247,"The product made a loud buzzing/grinding airplane-type noise as soon as it finished setting up which was truly deafening. I presume it was the fan producing this aggravating sound. No programs were running and the room was approximately 68 degrees Fahrenheit so overheating should not have been an issue. Since no computer should ever sound like a coffee maker at any time, I must conclude that it was defective. Return to sender."
1248,Exceeded my expectations! Some of the reviews had me a bit nervous but I can’t tell you how happy I am! The laptop is on almost brand new condition! Only 1 TINY nick on the front (you can’t see it unless your looking) and it was perfectly ready for me to set up my account! No issues or problems! It comes in a box perfectly protected and has the charger to go with as well👍🏼 So happy with it! Thank you!
1249,"I was so excited because this laptop came in perfect condition. But when I tried to change the unsername to my name it wouldn’t work. 3 calls to Apple later, and I find out this computer is owned by a school that can remotely access my laptop at any time. Meaning, if they wanted to they could shut down and erase my laptop. Amazon gave me a full refund but I am very sad and disappointed"
1250,"All in all, the laptop works great! It runs fast, it’s clean, and it’s perfect for what I needed it. The one disappointment I have it they claimed this product as a catagory A which means like new. When it arrived, the screen had two scratch marks on it that was discolored from the rest of the screen. I would understand like new for any other part to have a scratch, but the screen is a big deal and it should have mentioned that in the details."
1251,"This MacBook Air is amazing!  I had been previously using a 2007 MacBook Air and it was time to upgrade.  I have never purchased refurbished before so I really didn't know what to expect, though was greatly concerned.  Needless to say that this laptop heavily exceeded my expectations.  Other reviewers stated that their MacBook was not as described, though mine looks brand new.  The keys are still crisp and clean, the screen immaculate.  There are a few light scratches on the outside of the computer (mostly the underside), but it is very minimal and unnoticeable.It runs like a dream, though I have only begun using it.  I will update should the computer have any issues.  It is an early 2015 with 4 GB RAM and its OS is Sierra.  I wanted to share that, as I found the Q&A to be a little confusing on that point and other reviews didn't really mention it."
1252,"When I received this package, I was thrilled...until I tried to turn it on and got a “low battery” notification...for 16+ hours. Turns out the cord provided (not a Mac product) is not the correct wattage to charge this device. It’s hard to tell at this point if the computer is faulty or not now that I’ve purchased a new cord from Best Buy, but it shuts down as soon as it’s disconnected from power. The screen is pretty floppy, too- falls back without provocation. All of which seem like things that should have been mentioned in the details before I decided to purchase.After taking this computer to the Apple store, I was informed that the issue was indeed the battery- completely bad and had to be replaced. Again, something that I wish I had known before purchasing. It is in working order now, but doesn’t meet my standards of what “certified refurbished” means, and product details lacking for sufficient purchasing knowledge ahead of time."
1253,"It said I had to do an update. When I hit the only update allowed it said the latest version was already installed but it wouldn’t let me go foward.  Also the screen seemed loose.  So if it was cleared out they never installed the new software correctly. So it wouldn’t let me even get to the main screen.  Others had luck but I did not.Also when I plugged the power bar in. It had a bit of a shock come out. As an electrician, I know that was a big no no.  I was willing to spend the money and get the correct power cord. But with everything else. I thought that’s already 3 strikes. No thanks."
1254,I was very hesitant buying a used MacBook from Amazon but it turned out great! Looks new and works amazingly. You will receive exactly what was described. I have no complaints!
1255,"Good quality, arrived early. As-new condition. Easy to install from my old machine via time machine backup. The old one was a 2010, now we are good for another 5-7 years.Thanks"
1256,I have been struggling with this product since day one. I am not getting responses from the seller OR the extended warranty repair company.I have never had trouble with Amazon before. Every issue I have ever had has been settled with ease and courtesy.This has not. Made more devastating as it it is the largest purchase I have had and the product has been unusable almost since day one. We sent it to the extended warranty place who said they fixed it but it still doesn’t work.We have spent hours at Apple doing diagnostics and it is simply not functional. To repair it would cost more than I paid. They do not think that the parts it was refurbished with are even Apple parts.This was a terrible product and not worth the money.
1257,"I bought this Mac and it came with a non Apple charger, I bought this as travel computer, sure enough in the first week while I was in Europe I had to buy am authentic Apple charger at $117. Now a month  later my Mac has died. It was having issues as in when I tried to maximize the scene with Netflix it would just shrink to a 3x5"" screen volume,  also the screen had been replaced before I bought it and is not well attached, very disappointed, I bought this last summer, but only started to use it in October when I was traveling, so I spent close to $700 for a Mac that lasted 2 months, return and replacement window has ""closed"" so I am stuck with a hefty repair bill."
1258,"Was very iffy about buying refurbished but it’s honestly like new! There are a couple of LITTLE scratches but nothing noticeable! Compared to my friends MacBook Air that she paid 1100$ for and they are the absolute same. Best $500 I’ve ever spent. & the company is AWESOME! The charger didn’t work as soon as I got it & I emailed them. Within an hour I had an email from them and they were sending me a new charger, thankful my friend had her charger that I used until I received mine but the battery last like 2-3 days so it wasn’t that bad."
1259,"Seller: IT5050Wowie! My son wanted an Apple Computer for Christmas and I was not about to spend $1000+ on a laptop for a 11-year-old boy. But a refurbished MacBook was definitely priced more appropriate for him. This computer is AMAZING people!!! Looks so clean and new. Only a couple faint scratches on the bottom, the keyboard looks like it was hardly touched, screen is clear and no burn marks in it, plus the battery is great. The seller was so awesome to get me this gift in time for Christmas, they are quick to respond to emails and followed up to make sure it was delivered afterward. (seriously, the nicest people!) I had purchased another renewed MacBook from another seller, and their level of quality wasn’t as good, by far. I wish I could pre-select a quality grade for the laptop (excellent, good, fair, etc.), so it is a little scary just leaving it up to the unknown. I work in the retail business and I like to applaud small companies who sell quality products. Do yourself a favor and go here, they gave me a laptop that is stellar and eased my worries about a refurbished laptop. It really looks so good and is operating perfectly. This is such a smarter way to buy a computer, especially for kids, or if you like to have the pricier brands without spending the high price. – Happy Mommy!"
1260,"Wow! Bought this from TECHarvard and was claimed to be Certified Refurbished, which according to the Amazon description should show limited to no signs of wear.  Well the device that I received not only was pretty scratched on the bottom, had a huge ding on the corner of the top cover, but the keyboard showed more signs of wear than the MacBook that I've had for 5 years(Space bar was completely warped).  Definitely does not resemble a new device in any way shape or form.  If they are selling used devices, call them used and mark the price down accordingly.  This is definitely going back."
1261,"Overall the laptop is nice. A couple of marks on the outside but works relatively well. There was an issue with the battery that originally came with it. It would shut off around 65% battery life. I asked the seller for a replacement battery, which they gave to me free of charge. However, the replacement battery is not originally an Apple battery and instead a knock off. This issue prompted it to restart randomly no matter what the battery life was at. I’m putting the original battery back in and having Apple replace it with the appropriate battery for an additional fee. I got what a paid for and I won’t make the mistake of buying a refurbished Apple product from anywhere other than the Apple store again."
1262,This is the BEST purchase I’ve ever made! The laptop 💻 arrived on time and in MINT condition. It functions beautifully and works flawlessly for my personal and business needs. I would recommend this seller to any & all I know who are in the market for reliable and affordable devices.
1263,"Battery doesnt work! I travel to another country with the laptop and web I turned on and unplug it, it shuts down! And in Battery Options appears ""Replace now"". How you can help me? I'm in Ecuador now and wont be back in a year!"
1264,"I love my new MacBook Air, it came as expected (relatively like new condition). This my first Mac and I’d purchase it again refurbished, you save greatly and get almost the same product 😀"
1265,Bought certified refurbished ended up with a unit with a screen covered in dead pixels. I contacted apple to see how much a screen replacement should be more I'm looking a repair cost more than I paid for the laptop.
1266,"DO NOT BUY!!! I purchased this computer for about two month and one day I couldn’t turn it on after it goes into sleep mode for a long time. It just wouldn’t turn no matter what I do, I tried every single method out there. I had to press the power button a hundred times for it to finally turn on. But after a while even that won’t work. The computer is just dead. I had to take it to the computer store and they told me it costs $434 to fix it!!!! Even though I actually paid to get it fixed I recommend everyone do not buy!! It’s not worth the money and will cost you more!! The guy in the computer store told me that there is corrosion inside the motherboard and in order to fix it it costs a lot of money ($434). I am truly upset and wished I would have just bought a brand new one from apple that’s the newest version and which will cost me less than what I spent on this computer!!"
1267,"The laptop worked great the first week. Eventually, things started to decline and quickly.  I would constantly have to change the time clock, and that would prevent many apps from working properly or not at all. I also discovered that my webcam did not work. I asked customer service if I could get a replacement laptop, and they gave me a website to help me fix it myself. It did not work. Also, the computer would start dying very quickly, even after a full charge. I would also not start up automatically, even with the charger plugged in. I had to press to start button almost endlessly for it to just power on. Eventually, it just would not cut on at all, even with the charger plugged in. It’s completely dead. Apple says that it should cut on with the charger plugged in if it were a battery issue, so it’s definitely something wrong with it beyond that and it will cost upwards of $400 to fix. I’m totally bummed. It did not even last a year."
1268,"BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY MOTHER, SHE IS 70 YEARS OLD AND BARELY USES THE LAPTOP.THE SCREEN IS IN THIS STATE, APPEARS TO BE PEELING! VERY BAD!!"

   Note: My purchase was completed through Kanga Supply for this item that ultimately doesn't function as intended.Amazon Renewed item descriptions indicate that the products should work and look like new, which wasn’t the case for this purchase, ergo my poor rating. After only having the Macbook for less than a day, I was forced to reach out to the seller because the product no longer functioned as intended.CONSThe Macbook worked fine for the first hour or so of use, but during an update, the screen flickered vigorously (see video). I hoped it was just a fluke, and it led me to believe there may be some software or hardware-related issue. After having the Macbook for less than 12 hours, I was forced to reach out to the seller because the screen flickering caused the laptop to become unusable (see picture). I also came here to draft a review in hopes that my issue is resolved quickly and effectively. I'll update my review once this is complete.PROSAfter removing the laptop and inspecting the outside, I was pleased. The outside of the Macbook is in good condition, just one or two visible scratches or marks.The charger was not the original Apple charger (as other reviews have indicated) but an OEM adapter. I don’t care that much about whether it’s an Apple charger, as long as it functions.Specs match the advertised item I purchased:128GB SSD8GB ramEDIT/UPDATE: After reaching out to the seller as instructed with the Amazon Renewed products, I never got a response in the allotted timeframe (2 business days) and was forced to reach out to Amazon directly. Ultimately, this item was returned for a refund.UPDATE 2: Today is 1/13/2020 and I have still yet to see this problem resolved to my satisfaction (refund or exchange of working product), after having ordered this product on 12/26/2019. Highly disappointed both in Amazon and the third-party seller.UPDATE 3: Received a replacement Macbook on 1/15/2020. So far it seems to be working, no issues with the screen per the previous item received (was NOT the same item sent back, verified by serial number). Pleased so far with this item."
1270,"The 2015 Macbook Pro is still, in my opinion, the best Macbook even in 2019.  I use the SD card reader all the time and have several USB 3.0 devices.  I also use a newer 2017 quad-core i7 for work (no choice) but the difference in speed is not worth the added money and lacking ports.  When I actually put the newer 2017 to work, the heat issue is still a challenge for Apple and performance drops.  It's like having power that I can't actually use unless I sit in a walk-in freezer. Don't quote benchmark speed tests to me, what counts is actual performance sitting at my desk for hours at a time working on a project. I also prefer the magsafe power (although this one uses the magsafe II which I like less than magsafe I which had a more solid connection) This one, I purchased for my wife and it handles everything she needs it to do. Although you can't upgrade the memory on these models, so make sure you get enough for what you need.  If you want to change out memory, then the best choice is the Mid 2012 non-retina model which also come with DVD drives and has USB 3.0 ports."
1271,"First off, I am removing a star because they shipped a counterfeit 60W Magsafe 2 charger with my order. I contacted them immediately and they offered to accept a return of everything. I explained that the charger was my only complaint and they overnight FedEx'd a genuine Apple replacement for free.""we sent you the wrong adapter for this batch of order and will overnight you the correct genuine one.""So they knowingly ship counterfeit chargers with some of their orders?The computer is pretty good cosmetically and operationally, but not as great as other reviewers. It is an Early-2015 12,1 model, this one was built in 12/2016. There is a crease over the right USB port from somebody yanking a USB plug. The battery has 107 cycles (89% life left). Keyboard and display are in great shape with no flaws. The SSD has no dead cells. It came with MacOS 10.13 installed.Overall its a good laptop and decent refurbishment job.EDIT: Knocking off another star. They sent me another counterfeit charger. Apple would never loosely jumble the cord in the box, a genuine power supply doesn't stay powered on for several seconds after it's unplugged from the main or stay lit green/orange after its unplugged from the laptop and this fake only puts out 25 watts max."
1272,"I really feel like I got a great deal on this, mine arrived in brand new condition and it looked like it had never been used. I did see some people had bad experiences but mine was well worth the price tag. The only negative was that the charger provided is third party and not OEM Apple. The box is also generic and not Apple, not a big deal but you just don't get that same feeling opening it up as a new product. I will say that I checked the serial number on Apple and the computer itself was only a couple of years old, so in reality I paid around $450 for an Apple that was only a couple of years old with a decent amount of battery life still left. I only bought this as there was certain tasks that I could not do on my iPad and so I did not need a brand new super powerful computer. This one is great, does not get hot, fans are silent and the display looks incredible.Overall I was very happy with the purchase, it came fast and was like new condition at the fraction of the cost of a new one. I actually waited a few months before writing this review so that I could also include that I have had no issues at all in that time, battery lasts a decent amount of time and no software or hardware issues to report. It also runs the latest OS that I updated it to and I believe it will be supported software wise for some time to come. Completely worth the price!"

   The Macbook came in working condition with all original components and an OEM charger but not with the extension cord. The major downfall is the condition of the laptop, for the above average asking price for this model I expected great condition as it is stated to be like new but instead the model I received was in okay condition (not cleaned either, large collection of gunk in hinge vent) at best with a lot of edge scratches and deep cuts throughout the chassis, and some unremovable stains from stickers! And worst of all the battery was at over 500 cylces, the battery life was 4-5 hrs max! thats horrible for whats suppose to be a renewed device! Not satisfied!EDIT:  Avoid this entire listing especially from the seller ''Easymobiledevices'', they ship dirty grade b laptop and have poor costumer service."
1274,Once i started running it all sort of problems arises. First major problem is wifi drops off and will not let you connect to wifi. After this happens you cant even turn on/off the wifi. Used guest and still no wifi. Restarting or shutdown and restart will not activate wifi. If you restart it takes so long to reboot. Sometimes it get stuck on the waiting wheel on startup. One out of ten restart wifi will work for a minute but then drops off and you will no longer be able to connect again. I cant say anything physically because it looks fine. Lastly beware it shows and says freshly installed mojave os but it has instead sierra installed. The power cord looks like an imitation and not the original one because from the weight it is not the original one. I can tell because i have multiple macbook at home and that is not the original one. I am pretty disappointed with this seller.
1275,"I’ll update 15 days from today.CONS:-Delivery packaging: it was a regular box with one thick bubble wrap to protect the laptop.First glance, the charger seems pretty beat up but seems to work fine.-The outer top of the laptop has a lot of scuff marks and scratches. Sides do as well. Nothing TOO severe.-Bottom have some scratches and wearing on the rubber, not too noticeable.PROS:-Had a full battery-Set up went smoothly with no hiccups.-Outer signature glowing Apple works well.-Opening the laptop, the screen has no visible scratches, cracks, or scuffs at all.-Keyboard has no loose keys and is glowing well.-Trackpad has no scratches and works really well no weird working sides SO FAR.-Software automatically updated to Catalina, kinda wanna wait to update to Big Sur.I’ll update March 13, 2021"
1276,"Still a GREAT LAPTOP, arguably the best MacBook Pro 13” ever made, 2 or 3 iterations later! I have had mine for 3 months now and although I was a little disappointed that I got a no-brand MagSafe power brick instead of an Apple brand, it’s caused no problems for me. I have been using Logic Pro X a lot and it runs nice and smooth even with the haphazard way I use it, leaving muted unused tracks all over the place as I learn about things like track bouncing and experiment with every single effect and different audio formats (I feel bad sometimes like I am unnecessarily abusing the laptop, lol) and I haven’t frozen or crashed at all. I have used a few emulation programs for old Saturn, Super Famicom, PS and Dreemcast games that push the 2D sprite and parallax scrolling envelope and again I haven’t had any problems. Only thing I have experienced that has been an issue is the actual Mac OS and it’s limitations with regard to formats, programs that it supports and connectivity with outside developers but I have also been able to get around that by setting Virtual Machines up and GUID partitioning to use whatever other OS I need. This is also not a complaint about the hardware itself but rather the Mac OS software so should not be considered when it comes to the actual MacBook Pro 13”.You will want to upgrade to an NVME M2 SSD at least 256 GB or 512 GB right away, as the 128 GB SSD will fill up within 2-3 months of moderate use and the newer M2s will increase the OS loading speed more than anything else. Luckily you have your pick of great SSDs like the Samsung 970 Evo, etc that you can easily swap in with a $5 adapter, a screwdriver and no soldering (just search YouTube for “MB Pro 13 2015 SSD upgrade”)…The unique things and PROS about this MB Pro 13” are the older style KEYBOARD that doesn’t break like 2016-later model keyboards do, 2 USB 3 ports, an SD CARD R/W and a FULL SIZE HDMI PORT all built in. This is the last MB Pro 13 with any of those ports on board and the fact that you can swap SSD hard drives with no soldering and very little skill needed, all-in with the M2 you get a sexy little powerhouse for half the price of the newer model Pro 13”s (1/4 price of current gen)! The rest (CPU, onboard graphics, sound/speakers) make this laptop a must have that will likely only appreciate in value $$$!Two Thunderbolt 2/miniDisplayPorts are useful if you want to setup 2-3 Screens, but the CONS Are that you get NO ThunderBolt 3/USB-C ports and more and more adapters and devices require that connection these days, though with the USB 3 ports there are ways around it, complicated as they may be. You also CANNOT UPGRADE RAM unless you know how to de-solder the current ram and solder up new ram (accepts up to 16GB DDR-3 in 2X8GB formation) and setup the machine to accept the new ram, which seems a recipe to completely destroy the board/laptop without at least some Mac building & Mac hardware programming know-how, possibly even special equipment.MAKE SURE YOU GET THE MODEL WITH THE AMOUNT OF RAM YOU NEED BUILT IN & a CPU that will be sufficient for you and you won’t be disappointed with this awesome little 6 year old laptop! Don’t get the 4 GB model even if it will “work” for you “short-term”! I got the 8GB/i5 2.9Ghz/128GB and I already regret not paying another $100 for the 16GB ram model, but c’est la vie.Just buy this MacBook Pro 13” while you can, replace the SSD as soon as possible, enjoy it, keep it another 5-10 years and you will likely be able to triple your investment by reselling it assuming Apple stays on their current trajectory with their MB Pro Hardware releases!!!"
1277,"Hi, I bought this Macbook Pro 13"" early 2015 and received last week on Aug 23th. The laptop has a good appearance and doesn't have any flaws. However, the charger(45w) packed together with the macbook is not for macbook pro but for  Macbook Air. I just found out today, cuz when I use the charger(45w) laptop cpu temperatures goes up to 65-85 celcius. and I can't use more than 4 hours. But when I charge my macbook with Macsafe 1 (85w, which is for Pro), the cpu temperature keeps 40-50 degree, and it runs around 10hours. I want to change my charger into “MacBook Pro Charger 85w”. Thank you."
1278,I'm very dissatisfied with this purchase.I can't use the Mac because the hard drive was not reset and the software on the Mac dose not allow you to use it.Also there was no charger.Again very disappointed.
1279,"Looks brand new, wrapped and sealed in Apple packaging. Plugged it in and turned it on and let it go. Absolutely no problems, it was automatic and wonderful to have the computer set itself up. Has performed flawlessly as expected of an Apple laptop."
1280,"The laptop arrived in fair condition.  The screws show signs of wear so it may have been opened up during the ""renewal"" process.  Old stickers were left on the bottom. Also, the laptop was shipped with a cheap knockoff Chinese charger.  I have no reason to trust this charger so I'll have to order a genuine Apple one instead.Fortunately I don't need this machine to be a workhorse or I would send it back.  This should survive a year at least but I don't trust it as-is - I will wipe the hard disk, NVRAM, and SMC just to be safe."
1281,Product was faulty. The charging port wouldn't hold the plug. I returned it. I don't think the refurbishing process is very competent.
1282,"This is exactly like the MacBook I was given for work that was stolen on a plane flight. No problems with this as a replacement so far, smooth sailing for 3 months already! I got the protection plan just in case, but I'm very satisfied with this cheaper than new replacement. Will update if there are any issues that arise. Would recommend."
1283,"Idk what I was thinking not having an apple in the first place. This laptop is very easy to use, fast, and I’m excited to see how productive I can be with this format. I feel free, nothing holding me back now!! Unlike old pc with unresponsive interface, slow speeds, and constant crashes, this one gives me no problems!!"
1284,This laptop was literally like brand new out of the box. So far my daughter is so thrilled with her graduation gift. She is ready for college now!!!
1285,"Our first ever Mac but so far its been quite impressive. It was easy to setup and get it going. It works well and very easy to use, turn on/off, carry around and day to day life. Wish the battery would last a bit longer."
1286,"BUYER BEWARE!I knew by choosing a refurbished computer, I was taking a risk, but I never expected this. When I received this MacBook Air, I was surprised it was the model Apple stopped making in 2017, since the title said “Newest Version.” I emailed the seller and they said Amazon forced that in the title and told me I could return it. I work full time, am in grad school, and have three kids. I figured with it being an Apple it would last long enough to get me through school, so I kept it. Now, six months later the screen won’t turn on. It’s completely black.I am able to connect to an external monitor and use the computer that way, so I know it’s the display. After trying to adjust the brightness, several resets, resetting the SMC and the PRAM, I called Apple Support. They ruled out all software issues and told me it had to be the hardware.At this point I contacted the seller and they basically told me “sorry, it’s outside of the 90 day window so there’s nothing we will do for you.” I have escalated to Amazon trying to get some kind of resolution. They just confirmed there is nothing they are willing to do for me. They also are not doing anything to penalize the seller, All Out Apple. I'm shocked at Amazon. Shady sellers like All Out Apple will always be around, but I really thought Amazon was better than Ebay in that way. Lesson Learned.There is no reason a MacBook Air should have a display of a completely stops functioning after six months of use, even refurbished. I’m grateful that I had a work-provided monitor I can plug into to do my schoolwork, but if I was aiming to be tethered to my desk, I would have bought a Mac Mini."
1287,"Got the computer two days early! this was probably the fastest delivery I've ever received from amazon. I wasn't going to buy refurbished but I really wanted another MacBook and shelling out $2k for a new one was simply out of the question. When I saw the price for this MacBook Air, I decided to roll the dice and buy it. I knew it could possibly come not as advertised, such as having scratches or not being updated as far as software is concerned but when I opened it up it was practically BRAND NEW! set up was simple as can be! only took me 5 minutes to sign in with my Apple ID and all my information was synced between my iPhone and iPad and onto the MacBook Air. There were a few minor scratches less than a couple centimeters on the bottom of the computer nothing that noticeable. the charger doesn't stick as well as I'd like and one of the hinges is half broken off but I've that same issue with practically every MacBook I've ever had. I was really surprised with the quality. it said 2017 version but with all the updates and new iterations its hard to gauge which MacBook your getting I thought I was purchasing a much older MacBook Air than what I got this thing is amazing and the 13 in screen is far larger than I expected it to be feels like a 15 or 17 in display when having it in your hands/ the computer itself is incredibly light, the main reason I chose the air you can carry it in anywhere with one hand and hardly feel it definitely much lighter than my 2020 iPad 11"" All in all if you're on a budget, this computer is the way to go! for $400 its practically brand new and runs like a dream! thanks amazon for this incredible refurbished Mac! love it !"
1288,"I don’t what to think I bought 2017 16gb 256 ssd but I received a refurbished 2019 8g 256 perfectly packaged, I can’t put apple care I already call for that but im not sure to keep it because I want a computer of 16of ram but this one is 2019, im gonna give the chance to see how it works, And it cost me the same price of a refurbished 2019 Of apple but those ones you can put apple care"
1289,"hola, soy de peru. Estoy contento con la compra, la compre por el precio, y me llego tal cual las especificaciones.(late2018,2.3gz,8ram,256ssd). la bateria llego con 350 ciclos aproxen cuanto a lo estetico, tenia pequeños arañones en un costado, pero nada grave, la pantalla intacta y el touchbar ok. el cargador sellado oem.califico la compra como 9/10."
1290,Got a few months out of this before the screen started disappearing intermittently. Then it wasn't so intermittent. I'd have much rather spent the extra money to get a new computer that didn't break than to buy something second-hand and have to decide to repair or replace.
1291,"Considering I was 100% ripped off, I would not recommend you purchase from this seller, I did not receive what I wanted, the serial number for a COMPUTER comes up as an iPhone 11... Just.. No."
1292,This computer was working fine and all of a sudden the screen went out.  Cost me $640 to fix it.
1293,"Delivery was super fast, considering I’m in South Africa. The laptop is simply beautiful, woks well, no complaints, I love it."
1294,"Positivo, EXCELENTE EQUIPO!!!"
1295,So far this was a steal. Great product for a great value.
1296,super machine
1297,The space key and some of the keys were not working As they are supposed to. Really sticky
1298,"Arrived, boxed well with balloon cushions. Power adapter looked clean but had scratches. Opened up the Lid of the MacBookPro and it looked like it had some sort of disease or cancer & it smelled quite strange too. It had over 50% battery so I carried on with a reset which resulted in an error. Luckily it booted back into Yosemite OS that it had installed years ago, after 3 failed attempts managed to update to Mojave. Of course first things first copy music etc onto, USB stick struggled to go in either of the USB Ports (look at the photos) was also stuck after insertion but managed to pull out, with a hard pull - full force - anger. Had a look into the ports and discovered they were literally rusted dirty like disgusting, this is not the definition of Refurbished - but 2nd Hand or Heavily Used. Be aware, set your expectations right in oder to avoid any disappointments."
1299,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I was super stoked upon arrival, began setting up the laptop and within minutes the screen stopped working. Literally pixels. Severely disappointed. I have gotten ahold of kanga and they are working to replace the device but it has now been over a week since I’ve purchased the unit with two day shipping and still have nothing to show for it. I hope they come through on their end and send me a functional unit."
1300,"I've only had it for about a week now and this 2015 MacBook Pro is working phenomenally! I was kinda hesitant buying a refurbished MacBook from Amazon, but I can honestly say I'm go glad I went ahead and did. It came extremely fast and right from opening the box, it was as if I had bought a brand new one right from Apple themselves. There's not a scratch, dent, stain, dust or anything on it. So far it's working extremely well and I will definitely buy form this seller in the future and recommend them to others as well! Great price for a great computer."
1301,"I’ve had this MacBook Pro going on 4 days and so far so good! It has met all my expectations and more. I grew up using windows PCs. This is my first Apple computer and I’m happy to have made the transition. Wish I did this long time ago but better late then never. If it wasn’t for the packaging and not being in the original box, I probably wouldn’t be able to tell this was refurbished. This is just based from my experience using MacBooks at the Apple store. Also, there was a few minor scratches on the bottom of the laptop.I will revise and change review in a month if any problems. But as of now, my review above is how I feel."
1302,"I've only had it for a couple days, but so far this is a great purchase. The thing looks brand new, and I know it isn't. I am replacing an older Mac and just can't afford the prices of new machines from Apple. Using Migration Assistant (an app that comes with Macs) I was able to restore a time machine backup from the old machine, so I've lost nothing in the transition."
1303,"When I ordered this product for the first time, it came with a green line on the screen. I contacted the costumer service, they responded very quickly and replaced it.The second computer came with better specs, I was the happiest person... for 2 months though, the computer suddenly stop responding.Other things that are worth saying:- The charger is generic. A generic charger can easily damage the battery of the computer, that could explain my problem.- The second computer they sent, had a sticker that covered the whole low part of the computer (those stickers that are the same color as the computer and are used to cover up very big scratches.Conclusion: they can deliver a great costumer service, but not a working product."
1304,"The macbook pro only worked for a short while. It had a charging/powering problem - wouldn't keep a charge at first, then wouldn't power on even when plugged in. Confirmed it was not a charger issue.I contacted the company who said to send it back for repair. Once they received it they wrote saying it cannot be fixed and charged me a ""restocking fee"" in the amount of the purchase of the laptop. Outrageous!! I even had a protection plan for it. After numerous interactions they refused to help and returned the laptop without telling me. THEN they said they couldn't do anything in terms of a refund because I had the machine. Months later they refuse to resolve it and amazon can't help me because it's a third party seller. An ABSOLUTE JOKE of a company. I'm out over $500.00 with a computer that can't be fixed - and Apple store said they could try but for more than the computer's worth. So yeah. They have my money and I have nothing.DO NOT BUY from these people if you'd like to keep your money."
1305,"Hey all! So I’ve gotten into photography lately and needed a upgrade from my old 2012 MacBook Pro and 2011 Asus laptops for editing. Figured a 2015 model would be the way to go for a decent upgrade without spending tons of money. I was super skeptical about buying a reconditioned one through Amazon after reading the reviews and thought about it for about 4 hours before I made the transaction. Next day it was at my door step with me a bit nervous about opening the package and seeing a beat up MacBook, I opened the box and the MacBook was in a bubble wrapped sleeve and that’s it. Okay I’m fine with that but what was the condition of it? Looks like it barely got used or the previous owner always had a case on it. Outside from a few nicks here and there it’s flawless. Turns on and is super quick, the Retina display is beautiful and definitely enjoyable to watch movies. It came with Mojave so the first thing I did was update it to Big Sur and it’s still flawless. I’ve only had it for a day if that but so far I’m happy with my purchase. Just be mindful yours may or may not be like mine condition wise I got lucky. Should you buy one of these? I would I’m pleased with my purchase and I’m sure you would be too. But I’ll update with any issues if they come up in the future. Thankfully I’m a bit tech savvy so whatever happens I’m sure I can fix it."
1306,"This of course this is an old model and reconditioned/renewed, so I was expecting it to look somewhat used; however, this MacBook Pro is in PERFECT CONDITION as if I had purchased it new. I'm upgrading from a very heavy and slow 2009 white MacBook that's a dinosaur and I could only do very basic things on it. It has almost zero capability in terms of battery life (it could only be used plugged in) so this laptop is an absolute gem in comparison. This might be why I'm so hyped and elated. Plus the price was very good. *I hope the computer doesn't have some sudden glitch and dies on me...lol!Now, I can finally edit my videos in iMovie, which was not working on the old MacBook, because I couldn't update it anymore. I need this laptop mainly for traveling, to do editing work, I have a 2 monitor PC set-up at home. My only wish is that I could transfer my Adobe CS to the new laptop.SIDE NOTE: it's actually overall a little smaller than my old 13"" (screen size is the same), it's not as heavy, but not as light as the Air; it arrived with Catalina iOS installed and I had to upgrade to Monterey to use the newest version of iMovie - this isn't a complaint, just an observation."
1307,"I bought for my mom, great deal (sort-of), works great (after I deleted 2 mysterious old unknown wifi connections)I bought this for my mom, she was always having Windows problems, viruses disguised as virus removal, scammy pop-ups, and so on.  Happy day!  :DThey raised prices during Prime Day, wth?  I thought I was getting a good deal, but afterward I noticed the price went down.  Anyway, I ordered this for my mom.  She's been using Windows and I wanted her to experience a Macbook Pro.  This one is actually even better than mine!  I'm still happily using a Late 2013 2.4 Ghz 8 RAM 256 GB 13-inch Retina, her's is exactly the same except it's a Early 2015 and it's actually got 2.7 Ghz!  Anyway she seems really happy with it.  I set it up for her, and ran the serial number, which was not found, not surprisingly although I'm not sure what that means, and the update page in the App Store looks like it was coded in 1995, so I'm not sure what's up with that.  Could be something funky going on, but all I know is it works and we're happy with it.  She's getting used to using it, and she says it's fast and smooth.  She was getting tired of all the Windows updates and virus stuff and all the spammy popups telling her to purchase a virus disguised as virus removal, yadda yadda yadda, so I am well-pleased that she is now almost a full-blown Mac-head.  Thanks Apple.  I hope to be able to afford an Apple car when they do come out, haha.  I'm not sure about the battery-life yet, but I HAD TO replace the battery on mine, so replacing it on hers should not be a problem."
1308,It’s just one continuous problem after the other with this computer. It’s really not worth it to save a little bit of money just buy new not refurbished have your warrantee you’re better off in the long run.
1309,For this being my first ever Mac- This was an amazing buy... no scratches or dents. Its basically BRAND NEW. 😝😝😝The only thing is that it says 512gb but the space says 256gb so be wary of that.But other than that I am really happy with my purchase.
1310,Good
1311,Love it
1312,"the product arrived with the screen broken. I would like a refund of $ 400 to repair it, since he is now in Brazil."
1313,So happy with this purchase. Even my kids said it looks like the new ones. Has some minor imperfections but at the cost totally acceptable. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.
1314,"I purchased through amazon this m1 chip 512 gb 8ram macbook pro 2020 year manufacture.  I’m a mac user of many years.  The computer is blazing fast, slim, light with great battery life. A huge bonus—-little need for additional  anti virus add on software since the macbook anti virus platform is very solid. A hidden gem when you buy any apple device is phenomenal tech telephone support.  The advisors at the apple stores and by telephone are the best part of the apple experience for me and even rival the devices they sell. Yes, I hate the high prices and know the game but over time I’ve  accepted their price points because of the incredible tech support."
1315,battery would not take any charge  stuck at 1%
1316,"I cannot believe the condition my Macbook is in, you can’t even tell if it’s used and the packaging was very nice and professional with the white box and wrapped just like it is when you get it directly from Apple. I am super happy with my purchase, thanks Amazon."
1317,"Good, but it is a little small.. easy to control. Recommend if you are hard to control your computer"
1318,Computer will not charge.
1319,"""Refurbished"" even though Battery life was non existent from the startup, always check the reviews on laptops to make sure they have over 200, cause then you won't be played by greedy ass people like I was"
1320,"Minor scratches , for the price reduction is a great buy !!!"
1321,Light weight
1322,"El producto reacibdiocionado en muy buen estado, funciona perfectamente y venía totalmente protegido y embalado. Muy satisfecho con la compra"
1323,"Looks and acts brand new. Everything exactly as advertised. Will update if I have any issues but after a week I can say, I am pleasantly surprised!"
1324,"This is an unusually large advance over previous models, especially in raw computing power, but also in fun things like screen and headphone support.This Amazon listing has two different processors, the M1 Pro (listed as 16-Core GPU ""style"") and the M1 Max (32-Core GPU). I'll call one the Pro, the other the Max. I got the base Pro, but much of what I'll say applies to both, and I'll have some comments specifically about the Max too. (MBP below = MacBook Pro.)Amazon doesn't offer most of the options you can get, only the ones listed. For now (and probably later), that's the Pro with 16GB RAM and 512GB or 1TB SSD, or the Max with 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD. 3 versions total.Screen Brightness* and HappinessThis screen can get up to 1600 nits brightness and can sustain full-screen brightness up to 1000. That's very impressive, as MBPs since 2016 have topped out at 500.*But the vast majority of the time, this screen will also top out at 500, because those other numbers are only for HDR (high dynamic range, what Apple calls XDR), i.e. some videos and some photos viewed in some programs. If you're browsing the internet, using productivity apps, or the like, those are almost all SDR (standard dynamic range). You'll be seeing them at the same brightness as with MBPs for the last five years.That said, the new screen is beautiful and bright in both HDR and SDR for most situations. For HDR, it puts out more color and brightness, and darker blacks - a million-to-one contrast ratio - with a wider range of light and color that has more pop and more detail in shadows and highlights. It can be dazzling or just more realistic.For SDR, it's much like before, still a gorgeous screen, with better contrast than before because of darker blacks.Has more pixels per inch (254, up from 226), and more pixels all over (3456 by 2234, up from 3072 by 1920). The aspect ratio remains 16:10 (not counting the top menu bar).ProMotionProMotion is Apple's name for screen refresh rates that can go up to 120Hz, or lower to save processor/battery power when 120 isn't needed. This makes motion smoother, more natural.For now where ProMotion applies is limited. Most scrolling in browsing, including with Safari, still tops out at 60Hz. Which is fine for me, but it bothers some people, looks choppy to them. This could be changed with a software update.Bloom and GhostsBloom is when a bright spot on a dark background bleeds out past where it's supposed to be, a common issue with this kind of screen. I and most others think this screen handles it well (better than the iPad Pro), but it can still arise some.Ghosting is when a moving object leaves a noticeable trail of ghost images behind for a fraction of a second, one for each new frame until the old image fades. MBPs are notoriously mediocre at this kind of ghostbusting, and this screen is no exception. Expect the usual haunting, if you notice that kind of thing.PWMFor those concerned (you mostly know who you are), there is PWM (pulse-width modulation) on the smaller 14"" version of this screen, and so very likely on this one too, at a frequency of 14,880Hz at all brightness levels (measured by NotebookCheck). That's a very high frequency, considered well beyond what would cause trouble for the susceptible.The NotchAs you can see in the main photo here, there's a black Notch at the top of the screen. There are no pixels there. The long-desired improved camera is there, and a mic array and light sensor (and maybe room for a Face ID system if they decide to make MBPs with that). As with the iPhone Notch, it's controversial.You can make the Notch disappear, or rather blend in, if you make the background up there black. It also disappears into the black bars when you view things like videos in full-screen mode.The cursor disappears into the Notch if you put it there. If an app has menu items that stretch there, they disappear too, but they'll still function normally if you put the (invisible) cursor on them.Desperate times call for desperate measures. Most apps won't have this trouble, but if you must, you can avoid menu items disappearing by using the ""Scale to fit"" function, which shrinks the entire screen work area a little to fit below the Notch. Makes it look like an old 15"" if the background is black, like there are wide black bezels. (Google ""Scale to fit below built-in camera"" for full instructions and mockery.)There are also third-party apps, such as Bartender, to manage how items appear in the menu bar and keep them visible.Camera and MicsThe new camera that, along with the thinner bezels, makes the Notch necessary, is 1080p, with an f/2 lens for good exposure in the shadows. Video looks noticeably better than before, though it can have a processed look.The three mics sound very clean and natural but with a little less bass than before to my ears, which is fine.Extra ScreensYou can use two external monitors with the Pro, down from four with previous models. They can be up to 6K @60Hz with a billion colors. The Max can still use four: three 6K and one 4K, all @60Hz etc.You can use 4K @120/144Hz HDR monitors too.You can run two from one port if you use the right kind of dock or daisy-chain.Headphone OomphThe new headphone jack has more power for high-impedance headphones. It automatically adjusts, so it won't overwhelm low-impedance phones. If the headphones have less than 150 ohms impedance, they get 1.25 volts RMS. If more, 3 volts. That might cause it to fail to provide enough power to some not-so-high-impedance headphones that still require extra power, such as planars.With my 2016 15"" MBP, I've had to use a portable amp for my Beyerdynamic DT 1990 Pros (250 ohm), but now I can pretty well do without it, though sometimes only just. The volume on some sources is still not always what I wish I could make it. But now I can nearly achieve hearing loss with the intro to the guitar riff in ""Money for Nothing."" Which also sounds good, and healthier, a couple notches down.Among other headphones that have tested favorably with the new jack are the DT 990 Pros (250 ohm), and the Sennheiser HD650, 660S, 6XX, and HD800 (150 to 300 ohm).One report says the planar Hifiman HE4XXs (35 ohm planar) sound good, but most planars tested are said to need more power. The Audeze LCD-2Cs are reported to sound good enough, though not their best. The LCD-3s and Hifiman Sundaras and Aryas are said to be underpowered.For my usual regular-impedance phones, Cleer Flow IIs (16 ohm), the wired volume is a little louder than before, though still not always the earsplitting barrage I want for some sources. Maybe for the best.Quality iems (in-ear monitors) that require especially clean input, but not too much, reportedly sound good, including Andromedas and Moondrop Starfields.SpeakersThey're improved from the already laptop-leading speakers from earlier MBPs, with a fuller sound and decent kick, amazingly good for when nothing with a 3"" woofer is around.Apple mysteriously says the 14"" M1 has the same speaker system, but looking inside both machines shows the speakers in the 16"" are bigger - both ""subs"" and tweeters - and located differently, with the subs in the front corners on this one. The 16"" has fuller bass (such as it is).Heat and NoiseThere isn't any.None with my typical use, at least. If you push it hard, it can get warm, but not as hot as my 2016 15"". Which makes sense, as this has a larger enclosure, bigger fans, larger, better heat sinks, and more power-efficient processors. The fans don't have to spin up as much to do the same amount of cooling, so it's noticeably quieter even when it does heat up, rarely makes any noise at all.The 16"" Max comes with a larger heat sink than the 16"" Pro, so likely runs a little cooler and quieter sometimes, though the Max might get hotter when it uses a lot of that extra power.KeyboardVery quiet, much like the older Mac laptop keyboards, not the butterfly ones from 2015-19, but the rest. Maybe less travel in the keys than some of those, but plenty for me.I miss the touch bar sliders for fine control of some functions, but you can still use sliders via the Control Center, the icon next to the date on the screen's top menu bar. That's also where control of the keyboard backlight is, no more control for it on the keyboard.TouchpadThe best available by far, responsive and large so you can carry the cursor over a large area with more control. For clicks, it's great. For taps, which I turn off, it's not as great, according to those who prefer that - appears to be a software issue.PortsThere's one less Thunderbolt/USB-C port than before, but 50% more bandwidth (3 controllers instead of 2).The HDMI is 2.0, can drive up to 4K HDR @60Hz.The SD card reader is shallow, so the cards stick out. There might be room for a flush micro-SD adapter. I only have cards up to 64GB, which work fine. Some people have had trouble reading some cards, so it may be finicky.Battery LifeI usually keep plugged in, but the reviews I've seen that cover battery life tests typically say it's the longest of any similar machine they've tested, including PCs. Reports of battery life for office work, browsing, watching videos, and so on generally range from 10 to 16 hours, sometimes more. It can go unusually long with heavy use too, 5 hours or more of video work, for example. Max Tech did 10 benchmark and stress tests with it in a couple hours, some maxing out the CPU or GPU for up to ten minutes, and it still had 36% left.At normal settings, there's no performance hit until you get down to 3%; until then you can process or game at full tilt. There's a low-power mode that extends battery life by limiting performance, lowering screen brightness, etc. The Max also has a high-power mode, but it seems to only ramp up the fans sooner to help cooling. Apple's description and tests in reviews indicate it doesn't affect performance in any direct way.The Max has tended to have a little less battery life than the Pro in reviews. The only good tests I've seen that compared directly either found negligible differences or up to 15% less battery life for the Max. (Other tests haven't been well controlled.)You can quick charge to 50% in a half-hour. The new power brick is 45% more powerful than before, and maybe 30% larger lengthwise, still small for what it does. You can charge at lower speed with smaller bricks (not included) via the USB-C ports.Size and WeightIt's noticeably heavier than before, about 5 ounces over the previous 16"", and not quite as sleek, but it's sleeker than I was expecting from the photos.RepairabilityHa ha! But really, it's better than it was. Battery modules now have pull tabs so they can be more easily replaced. The screen can be replaced more easily, but if Apple doesn't do it you lose True Tone (which I don't want anyway). The headphone, Thunderbolt and MagSafe ports can be replaced without replacing the logic board. Now rates a 4/10 from iFixit for repairability, up from 1/10 for the previous model.CompatibilityComes with Rosetta 2, which enables M1 Macs to use programs written for Intel Macs, and usually works very well.There's no more Boot Camp, so to run Windows or Windows programs you have to use third-party software like Parallels, which runs Windows by emulating a Windows machine (and requires a Windows license), or Crossover, which modifies Windows programs to run on Macs.  Which works best, or at all, depends on the program.GamingWoW *mostly* runs 50 to 120fps at high settings and resolution, depending on the location. Some places can't even manage 50 at those settings, though, but do OK at more compromised settings. Baldur's Gate 3, Diablo III, CS:GO and several others can run at 60-100fps or better at good settings.You can play Windows games via Parallels or Crossover. They generally don't run as well, but some do fine.Most games, including native ones, run quite a bit better on the Max, with up to 2x the fps. Final Fantasy XIV is hit and miss at good settings even with the Max.Gaming isn't usually hot or noisy, can get warmer with light fans for the games that aren't running natively. And there's no noticeable performance hit for gaming on battery.WorkI have to mention the less fun part: how well this does things you might have to do at work. It does almost all of it better than before, much of it way better. Here's how it compares according to actual test results from numerous sources with Xcode, Logic Pro, Lightroom, Blender, Final Cut Pro, Premiere Pro, and so on. The range of comparison depends on what the task is.Previous base MBP 16"" (Intel i7 AMD 5300): The Pro is 60% to several times faster.Previous top-spec'd MBP (i9 5600M): The Pro is about the same to 2 or 3 times faster.Regular M1 machines (not M1 Pro or Max): The Pro is about the same to several times faster.The 14"" M1 Pro with same specs: The same, though the 16"" has the bigger battery and heat removal system, so it fares better in those ways.Windows laptop work stations: This is complicated, but the Pro can thrash most Windows laptops in most intensive work-related apps. It lines up very roughly with machines with a good i7/i9 and an RTX 3070, but generally can't keep up with the RTX 3080. The Pro uses a fraction of the power, and so only produces a fraction of the heat and noise, if any. And lasts and performs much better on battery.Pro vs MaxThe Max is about the same to twice as fast as the Pro, mostly between those extremes. The CPU is much the same, but the GPU is double the cores, so the main advantage is in graphics-heavy work.Besides the GPU cores, the Max has twice the bandwidth for memory transfer, two hardware video encode engines instead of one, and some extra cooling capacity.If you're already successfully using a Mac laptop, you don't *need* the Max, since the Pro is already better than what you have. But that doesn't mean you can't benefit from the Max's extra power if you have the money. For intensive video editing, massive photo editing, or better gaming (though cheaper Windows machines will play most games better), the Max has real advantages.To confuse things a little more, Apple (but not Amazon currently) also offers a demi-Max with a 24-core GPU, halfway between the Pro's 16 and the Max's 32. It's a cheaper way to get the extra bandwidth, video encoder, and cooling advantages of the Max. Tests show that in graphics-intensive tasks it operates roughly midway between the Pro and 32-core Max, often more than half, as expected.WarrantiesThis comes with a one-year limited warranty against manufacturing defects that includes free phone support for the first 90 days. If you want to also cover accidental damage (with deductibles) and extend the regular warranty and free tech support to 3 years, you can buy 

AppleCare+ from Amazon

   (link embedded) or Apple. You get 60 days from purchase to buy it, but coverage for accidents doesn't start until you do. (I always self-insure when I can, so I didn't get it.)DecalsLast and least, this comes with two black Apple decals, the sign of true professional Apple equipment."
1325,Out of the box unusable for me. This MacBook Pro does not have any USB ports to be able to restore from a previous Mac back up that’s on an external drive. You must buy an adapter. Since I live in a remote area I’d have to order online and wait. You cannot even plug a iPhone12 Pro Max directly into it. The only ports it has are thunderbolt. So even Apple’s own lighting connector needs an adapter. The keyboard is a downgrade from the old keyboard. Solid black plastic instead of plastic keys surrounded by aluminum which were easier to see. Had to call Apple support to download an update because there is no reset option in the System Preferences of OS Monterey. And the update did not work to give it that option. Will have to figure out a different option to remove my account and information to return it. This particular MacBook is defective I believe.
1326,I ordered the 2021 16 inch right away as I knew they would probably sell out fast. I had to make sure I had one for my trip I am leaving on soon.  As soon as I opened it the screen would never come on.  Thought maybe it needed charging so I tried that.  Still nothing but a black screen.  It kept making the sound when you open it up even when it was closed over and over again.  I took it to the local Apple Store hoping I could get some answers.  They tired to get it to work and could not either.  They said it is very strange and maybe something happened to it during shipping.  They said since it is brand new it would be best to get my money back from Amazon.  I thought maybe I could just exchange it before my trip but the one I ordered is out of stock.  I will try the 14 inch and see if I like it compared to the size of the 16 inch since it is in stock.  This is a first MacBook Pro I have ever purchased and now I am a bit nervous.
1327,"Here are the temperature results for the new cool MacBooks compared to the old overheating intel ones. 91 degrees for the old one near the processor, and 74 degrees on the new ones. Both had been running for hours transferring files nonstop. Amazing. I have been editing video, transferring large files and not once have the fans kicked on. Makes me want to cry."
1328,"Finally, this 2021 MacBook Pro cured my depression!"
1329,Arrived DOA - wouldn’t start up. Spent hours on the phone with Apple support and still wouldn’t start. Returned - c’mon man!
1330,"This laptop is unbelievably fast. Between the screen, battery life, and performance, this laptop is head and shoulders better than any competition."
1331,My first ever MacBook. Switched over from PC and I can't believe I didn't switch sooner! On the pricer side but I'm super happy with my purchase!
1332,"I have been using my MacBook Pro from 2014 for work until last week when I finally purchased this MacBook Pro. My old MacBook starts up and works as fast as the day I bought it. The only reason I bought a new MacBook was because the battery life was getting low. I probably could have just bought a new battery and it would have been fine.That being said, I did hold out for this MacBook because Apple brought back the ports that I needed. I use the HDMI and SD ports daily. An Ethernet port would have been nice but that’s asking too much. This MacBook has a 2 day battery life and is blazing fast. I use Adobe programs and this MacBook doesn’t even blink when I do live editing. Best laptop I have ever used.I own a business that uses many PC laptops and a couple MacBooks. A PC will never last as long as a MacBook. And, a PC ALWAYS gets slower after 6 months of use. The price is high but you can buy a new PC every 2 years or a MacBook every 7 years."
1333,"Coming from a 2019 16in, I feel that this generation is 2 steps forwards, 1 step back.Pros:-Fans are never audible even under full extended load!  This was my #1 issue with my 2019 mac which would have constant fan noise with 2 monitors.-2x battery life-Better screen especially in dark environment or a dark subject-Extremely fast for certain workloads such as video editing and code compilation.-magsafe is back (although I personally don't care for it)-most apps work normally with rosetta emulation, but may have some stutter.Cons:-thicker and SIGNIFICANTLY heavier.-Screen has a notch which is very distracting for me.-Still has some compatibility issues.-Terrible for games.  Only a few titles are supported natively.  I only tested league of legends(uses rosetta emulator), but it was choppy and 1/3 the fps of my 2019 intel macbook.- +$300 base price even though they got rid of intel.-The area I feel apple has made a major misstep is with ports.  I couldn't care less for SD card or HDMI, but everyone who buys this is going to need USB-A.  It's ridiculous that I still have to bring a dongle everywhere just to use my mouse but these ports I never/rarely use are back.Also some developer related tools/libraries aren't working.C# debugger is totally unsupported for example.  Anything that requires gpu hardware acceleration (pytorch) is unlikely to ever be supported in any usable form.  Linux dual boot is unsupported or in early experimental stages.  I also had issues building/running java projects natively, but no issues with rosetta.If you're looking to buy this for an undergrad program, it's probably workable.  However, I'd suggest saving some $ and getting a used mac or windows machine.  Professional devs will be aware of their specific requirements, but I suspect many will need to keep a secondary x86 machine for the foreseeable future."
1334,"I am writing this review focused primarily on people who are considering jumping from the 13"" MacBook Pro to the 14"" MacBook Pro, which is what I did. I moved from the 13"" MacBook Pro M1 with 16gb of RAM to the 14"" MacBook Pro M1 Pro with 16gb of RAM.Size: So, 1"" of screen might not seem like a lot on its face, but the difference is pretty substantial, in my opinion. Even the pictures don't quite do it justice. The screen feels considerably larger in a package that isn't considerably larger. For me, it's the perfect sweet spot for someone who wants something larger than the 13"" model, but smaller than the 16"". I had a 16"" MacBook Pro i9 and it was just too much for me. This one feels perfect.Form Factor: The new 14"" and 16"" MacBooks both adopt a thicker chassis, which is shown in the pictures. As such, Apple decided to make the casing flat instead of gently rounded. It honestly reminds me of the pre-unibody builds, but still sleek and modern. If I didn't know this one was new and you just laid them side-by-side, I might say that the old form factor looks a little newer, but that isn't to say that it looks bad.Aesthetics: Overall, I touched on the aesthetics a bit in the ""form factor"" section. It looks like a high-end laptop, but at the same time I can see some people thinking it looks dated. I personally like the flatter look over the more rounded look, but it will depend on the person. Another thing I like is moving the ""MacBook Pro"" branding from under the screen to the bottom of the casing. I just think it provides a cleaner look during use. The black background of the keyboard is also a plus for me. The old space gray background was fine, but I really like the black.Function: Most people probably won't notice a massive difference in the previous iteration and the new iteration. For the 14"" and 16"" MacBook Pros, the touchbar has been removed. This will make a lot of people happy. For me, I was always pretty ambivalent about the touchbar, but I'm not going to complain about a key row there. The keyboard appears to have ever so slightly more travel and bounce. It's not a huge amount, but it is noticeable. I'll touch on The Notch later.Performance: My 13"" had the M1 chip and now my 14"" as the M1 Pro. So far, I haven't noticed a tremendous difference when using programs like Logic Pro, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Lightroom, but I wouldn't say those are super intensive programs. If you're exporting massive 8K videos, you might want to jump up to the M1 Max. One thing I have noticed is that the thermals are maybe a little bit worse. Just a touch. I have noticed it warming up a bit, but the fan still has not come on once. I only mention this because my 13"" M1 stayed cold at all times. It's not as bad as my i9, which sounded like a jet engine revving up while it jumped well over 100 degrees, but it's something to be aware of.The Notch: Honestly, so much has been made of the notch and I think it's mostly overstated. Yes, it's fun to meme the fact that Apple still hasn't found a way around the notch, particularly on iPhones, but it's really not a huge deal. Were it up to me, I would have just left a bezel up there, but I can understand why Apple didn't. I use a Dell XPS for work and it has razor thin bezels with no notch, but at the same time the camera is an absolute joke. Looks like it's from 2002.The Notch (cont'd): The notch behavior can be inconsistent from app to app, but not to the point where it's bothersome. I have seen some programs with very large nav menus up top bump the status bar out of the way to make room. And while this particular phenomenon is not something new for MacBooks, losing a big chunk of that bar to the notch will likely make this a more regular occurrence for people. Do I wish it didn't have a notch? Yeah, probably. Does it hurt the experience? Very, very little.Screen: For everyday indoor use, which is almost exclusively what I do, I think you will be hard-pressed to find a better screen on the market. The 120Hz refresh rate is something I waited a long time to get on the iPhone, so I was pretty shocked to see it implemented on the new MacBook Pros just a month later. It actually has more pixels/inch than the iMac 27"" 5K screen, which I also use pretty regularly. All-in-all, the screen is just the best in the business.Overall: It's a great and powerful laptop for someone who is wanting a little more than web surfing and word processing. I use mine primarily for recording music, as well as live performances using standalone plugins, so I need something that is powerful and easy to use. The MacBook Pro has always fit the bill, but now with the M1, M1 Pro, and M1 Max chips, I have absolutely no concern for performance or consistency.My 13"" M1 did just what I needed in this regard, but I'm someone who wanted a slightly larger screen without drastically increasing my footprint and weight. The 14"" MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip is just what I needed. If you're someone who needs absolutely top notch performance, I'd recommend upgrading the RAM and going with the M1 Max."
1335,"I haven't upgraded my computer for more than a decade, so it would stand to reason any recent releases would impress me, but this macbook pro has gone above and beyond in the small time I've had it.The screen is truly something to behold. Smooth, clear, just beautiful. I don't typically care about bezels, but I might start. The expanded screen makes an unexpected difference. Meanwhile, I barely notice the notch. Apple said they'd find workarounds to make it scarce, and they have.The speakers are wonderful as well. I was skeptical at first -- thought I caught some tinny effects on a couple songs, but the more I listen to them, the more I'm convinced the tinniness was in the recording (it was a live album, which might explain it). As for the spatial audio, I've only heard a couple songs, but it's pretty trippy. This is my first experience with it, and it doesn't disappoint.In the short time I've had the computer, it's been nothing but fast. Probably more computer than I need, so if you're a sound editor or photographer, this review probably isn't for you. But for those of you casual users who want a solid machine that will last (as I said, my last macbook pro made it more than a decade), this is the one. Excited as I was for my last macbook, I could see room for improvement at the time. Right now, I don't see how things get better than this."
1336,"M1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. Compared to previous MacBook Pro, it's a giant leap ahead. These tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the Macbook. This particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro,  but it still kicks butt. You can get the Pro Max chip and bump up the RAM to 64GB if you want - and add tons more storage. The 14 inch MacBook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. It can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. The display is stunning. Just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. The brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. Real HDR viewing -  a big difference. You will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. After 10 minutes I don't even notice it. It means nothing for your experience. Its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. Camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous MacBooks. Six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. Music/movies it feels like surround sound. For video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. The keyboard is a dream to type on. Very solid like all MacBooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. The Apple Magic Keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. Battery life is amazing. I have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. At best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! Especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it won't be 17 hours but I did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. The power efficiency is ground breaking. They have added back the MagSafe power plug - which is great! And added back an SD card slot and and an HDMI port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. I wish it had at least one USB-A old style port - but it doesn't. You get three USB-C thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. They got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro MacBooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. Apparently they listened to a lot of users who didn't really like the touch pad. The shape and style of this laptop is great. Some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. That is BS. I have been typing most of the day and I don't feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. Very comfy for typing. Some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new Macbook Pro, but I am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside -  this is an amazing laptop - the best Apple has ever made, hands down. And I would say you won't find a better power laptop anywhere.  All that said - this is not a gamers machine. Apple is not for hard core gamers. I mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. I am a hard core gamer and a PC geek  - I have a powerful windows PC for gaming. And always will. But for everything else. this MacBook is king. I use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. I can plut into a giant monitor if I want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch IPS panel. So if you are wondering if this Macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - I am here to tell you, its the real deal. I finally upgraded from my 2015 MacBook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. If you are thinking of getting one - you won't be disappointed. One last comment. I am an old timer windows guy, and I know all the counter arguments for the Mac. Many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. First, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new M1 Pro chips - you can't. And aside from that, the Mac OS is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text FROM A PHOTO! Whaaat? And the design/ergonomics/quality of these MacBooks is unmatched. So, yes you pay more - but you get more. My last MacBook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. If you want this laptop - get it! It rocks."
1337,"I have a Mabook Pro covered by Apple care. The computer needs a new battery. To make a long story short Apple left me for months with a computer, again under warranty, which I can use for a couple of hours for simple tasks like web browsing before it needs to be recharged. Apple refused to replace the battery because the diagnostic read 81% not below 80 % as per policy. In all this Apple didn’t have any problems asking me to invest countless hours of my time between doing clean installs trips to apple stores etc.. I feel a more respectful way to treat me as a loyal customer could have been let us replace the battery first and if that doesn’t fix the issue which I seriously doubt ask me to do troubleshooting. All this to save something that would probably cost you few $$. Seriously ?"
1338,sent me base model
1339,"I probably got a faulty laptop but the charger status doesn’t show it’s charging when plugged in, only thing indicating that it’s charging is the orange light. My chrome windows keeps crashing whenever I put the computer to sleep and the external video display rarely connects"
1340,"I never write reviews, but feel compelled to write one for this Macbook Pro. I've owned macs consistently since 1990s and have dealt with eye strain on the air and now on this laptop. It gave me horrible headaches and eye strain even with a matte protector. I returned it and am now looking at PCs for the first time because if I can't read from the screen without it making me sick, I can't use it."
1341,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   My first MacBook ever! I had been saving up for it before the official drop— & I was not disappointed! Love the Touch ID feature, and it’s so efficient! Can’t wait to use it when I go back to school!"
1342,"This laptop has a superior display, superior speakers, superior camera and an excellent keyboard. Don't go cheap and buy the ""affordable"" MacBook Air base model like some of these talking heads have been advising. It's not a good buy if you are unhappy with it after six months, and believe me, you will be unhappy with 8 GB of RAM and two USB ports after six months. M1 MacBooks are not upgradeable so if you find that you need more RAM, you are stuck. Unless all you are doing sending emails, tweets, and watching TicTok, you will probably need something more, especially if you are using your laptop for work. I'm using my MacBook Pro with an LG UltraFine 5K 27 inch display as my desktop system, which replaces a 27 inch iMac. I'm very happy."
1343,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Sheeeese! What can I say? Apple has done it again 🤪😍 magnificent piece of device I must say."
1344,"I pulled the trigger on this thing hoping that the bad reviews were wrong.. some of the comments saying it came dirty and defective definitely gave me pause however, what arrived today was practically a brand new macbook. the device does not show any signs of wear and the battery cycle count is 18, it came with the original power brick and while the cable was used, it was not worn or dirty in any way. While i've only just started using the device about an hour ago, I can tell you that it's speedy and works flawlessly... had I not known it was a refurb when buying it, I would have easily confused it for a brand new mbp.. for those asking, this is a 2017 macbook pro and the specs as quoted are accurate. i'll play around with this thing for a little while and update this review as needed, but so far this looks like a winner!***update***A few months in and it’s still working flawlessly. I don’t regret my purchase for one second, and neither should you!"
1345,This is not a 256GB MacBook Pro- they are falsely advertising it as such and then shipping buyers 128GB versions.
1346,"Came in used and dirty, and it was not even turn off, I'm gonna return it. So disappointed."
1347,"Wow. I cant say enough how happy I am with this laptop! I it arrived early, and for a refurbished computer I swear it doesn't have a scratch, dent, smudge or single flaw anywhere on it! Its fast, the battery is great, its working perfectly! I couldn't be happier with this thing!"
1348,"Was excited to receive it and on the outside it had one noticable chip in the case on the cover side (which had a sharp edge to it), but thought that isn't too bad.  But when opening it up the screen in both the top left and top right were broken/chipped/cracked like it had been dropped and they replaced the cover, but not the screen.  This was not acceptable.  Wanted to try it out and ended up learning that some of the keys did not work right (sticky, pushed strange and such), plus the touchpad/mouse was really strange and didn't seem to work correctly.  Too many issues out of the box for me and too concerned that there might be other issues from where it looked to have been dropped and such.  Sending it back and just started that process.  So far the return seems ok....but just hate that the product does not match the description...using their words ""Renewed products work and look like new""."
1349,"I ordered the space gray with 256 gb of ram and received a silver with 128gb.  I knew this could happen as the picture did not match the description and I had seen other similar reviews.The good news is it was on time and in flawless condition.  I think I will stick with it and not press my luck, as it is still a fair price and a great machine, but beware."
1350,"I have to admit, I don't typically write reviews and I was a little hesistant about the product due to some 1 to two star reviews. The space gray model not only is at a great price, it came to me brand new. With all the specs I was expecting, i5 8GB RAM 256GB SSD, and works like a dream. Battery life is great, setting up was easy, and all my Apple Products (iPhone, Apple watch, Earpods) synced with no issues. I'm not sure as to why there were so many negative reviews, but mine is not one of them. SO HAPPY!! I truly recommend."
1351,the battery is dead
1352,"This product arrived quickly and looked great.  There have been multiple glitches with the power switch and with the screen ever since it's arrival.  Most of the time the power button would require multiple attempts to push before the computer would power up.  When the computer woke from sleep state (opening lid after its been closed for at least fifteen minutes) the screen would be black and then all pixelated.  Most recently, the computer wouldn't even turn on, when it finally did, it was all reset and all the settings were reset.  I lost everything I had put on the computer over the past day.  The seller still hasn't gotten back to me after email and I left a voice message.  I have now initiated a return as I want my money back.  It would have been nice if they had gotten back to me ASAP when I emailed or when I called (during normal hours of operation, by the way) and it went to voicemail.  The fact that they didn't and the computer kept coming up with other issues.  I now will buy a new one.  The value is not there with the aggravation generated."
1353,"Multiple reviews mentioned getting devices with used batteries, screen issues, etc.My laptop arrived through FedEx Express with questionable packaging. But everything was intact and fine. The laptop still had the plastic wrapped around it as MacBooks directly from Apple do, even with the screen cover. Only 3 battery cycles out of the box, with a new charger in the box. I am very satisfied with the purchase although in the Q&A section of this product someone mentions that this is a 2018 model, its not, its a 2017 (At least the one I received.) which for me isn't really a big deal since it arrived in exceptional condition. Highly recommend this MacBook."
1354,I'm a fan of apple products and I like almost everything about this new MBA. But it has one huge flaw that nobody talks about. It's the camera hardware and it hasn't been updated in ages. My zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light. A $1000 laptop with 10 year old front camera is unacceptable. Camera is very important to me. Especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time.
1355,"Liked:- Long battery life (one charge WILL last all day, i.e. 16 hours. Personally tested true)- Speed (the new M1 processor really is fast)- Quiet (no fan but the laptop still does not get hot)- Light and portable- High resolution & bright displayDisliked:- As with other MacBooks, the keyboard is mediocre especially compared to laptops like Lenovo Thinkpad- Incompatible applications (With the M1 processor still being new, you might experience existing programs frequently crash. For example, Chrome keeps crashing) But I would guess there will be a fix soon"
1356,"UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable.The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long.Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using ""swap memory"" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board.***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB.I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models.There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD.***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly.------I purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12"" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1.The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco.I likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive ""Pro Apps"" running at the same time.I would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.I would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball ""not responding"" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1. If however, you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable, faster and cooler running than the Intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable Mac."
1357,"The M1 chip really is amazing. But it only lasted five days for me. Somehow mine managed to break after using a third party USB C hub. The screen wouldn’t turn on at all, and an Apple repair tech couldn’t figure it out after doing a few quick tests. Oh and then Apple said it would take a month to replace it with a new one."
1358,"Beautiful laptop. I’ve upgraded from the MacBook Air of old...so far this laptop has blown it away. It wasn’t overly pricey to be honest and I feel it’s worth the price. Overall look is great and keyboard feel is nice. Larger touchpad is great, I’ve paired my Magic Trackpad 2 with it as well."
1359,"I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13"" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13"" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.Good:- SCREEN looks great!  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  I usually don't go above 50% brightness.- KEYBOARD is good.  Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard.  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic.  Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great.  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.- LOOKS GREAT.  Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.- NO FAN.  That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.- PERFORMANCE.  It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time.  For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU.  Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27"" (top end) with Intel chips.- TOUCH ID is great still.  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons.  On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA.  Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch).  You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay.  And so on and so forth.- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.NOT GOOD:- WEBCAM still sucks.  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc.  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27"" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera).- ONLY 2 PORTS.  Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort).  Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame.  I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.OVERALL:A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem.  Love it so far!"
1360,No complains so far.  Very fast and performs great.  I had a 2014 MacBook Air and finally upgraded this year.  This is leagues beyond that entry and I’m very happy with this upgrade.
1361,"Lightweight, blazing fast, easy to use, battery life is incredible with the new Apple M1 chip.  A typical Great Apple product.However, there is only a Thunderbolt port, so you now have to go out and buy a cable to convert USB to thunderbolt (if you want to use a backup hard drive) or other USB items, AND, I had to buy yet another cable to sync my phone's lightning port to the thunderbolt port on the computer. Total $56.I LOVE Apple product, and worked for them in my caerer, but I would wait on buying this version until the software for it has been developed.UPDATE: After several months of using this computer, I have have found several things of concern:1.  my notification center keeps disappearing, despite my constant reinstalling the widgets.2.  my computer's calendar, reminders, and photo stream do not sync with my IOS devices (iPhone & iPad).  If I add an item to calendar on my phone, it will appear on my mac but not vice versa.  Reminders will not sync regardless of which device I originate the item on.I have contacted Apple support on all these issues and they cannot solve the problem.IT APPEARS THAT THE BUGS HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED OUT, YET.  THINGS ARE MADDENINGLY CLUNKY!"

   Bought this laptop bc i needed it for spring semester and i needed an upgrade from my heavy macbook pro. I go to work too so i needed something super light and thin i can just bring everywhere and slide it in my bag.I am obsessed with how fast this macbook is. The battery life is on point. I used it for movies and series at work and it lasted for 3 days. The processor is definitely sooo good. I open so many tabs at once and it has not lagged on me. The keyboard and trackpad is responsive.I love the color. The main reason why i bought this too. 😍😂I have no problems with it at all.Highly recommend"
1363,Opened my brand new $1000++ computer and the entire screen was cracked and destroyed. Awesome! Thanks Amazon.
1364,"Delivered to me within 12 hours of purchase... Sealed in original apple packaging with protective film, blemish free, not a scratch.. Mint.its powerful, Ive already loaded some big task audio software and broadcast software on it and its flying through the multiple processes together at ease... (Logic 10.5 / Traktor DJ 3.0 / OBS)Super light and portable, If this is a MacBook Pro then I can't even imagine how light the Air models are. Nor could I even imagine why you may need something more powerful. I am having to adjust to the new keyboard and Touch Bar, I keep hitting Siri and volume settings, even as I type this.id also recommend getting a keyboard cover as well.... I hear these keyboards go out sometimes and to repair it. This is no fault to the reseller, but I can't believe Apple with their price points don't offer a bigger SSD for the lowest price point.... 128gb is laughable so be prepared to buy an external SSD along with a Thunderbolt 3 / USB-C Hub to run hdmi, and various external accessories.Overall I love this computer so far, it was a nail biter as I rarely ever shell out $1,000 on anything but I'm very pleased and satisfied with my purchase. And I still cannot find a better deal on the internet, not even used on Facebook marketplace, letgo or craigslist....Five stars"
1365,So not worth it. All they want to do is take your money do NOT BUY THIS ONE! Its used and if you search apple on amazon they have brand new with higher stats for cheaper.
1366,"Just received this, but so far so good. It looks BRAND NEW. There are literally NO signs of cosmetic wear or damage. It arrived in a sealed apple box. I’m finishing setting up and I already love it. For just under $1,200 for a 2019 model, this is a GREAT deal!"
1367,"I really love my MacBook. I really love this laptop. I'm a huge MacBook fan and this works like new. So far I don't have a problem with the butterfly keyboard, but I heard bad reviews about the keyboard from watching YouTube videos. I think that they may have fixed the keyboard problem when they refurbished the product??? I'm not sure, but honestly this a really great laptop for a really great price. I do wish that it came in the original Apple box and packaging, but it wasn't far from the really deal."
1368,"It looks and feels brand spanking new! Definitely happy with my purchase considering that I bought a brand new 2020 MacBook Air and hated it. Returned it back in 2 days. I paid a lot less for the Pro than the Air and its A LOT better with so many features. I’m not trying to persuade anyone out of getting the Air but if you are considering on buying a MacBook my advice would be to just go ahead and get the pro. The Air reminds me of a google chrome book slapped with an Apple logo on it. Not saying that google chrome books are bad, but there’s no need to pay a full band for the Air when you could find something similar and a lot cheaper. All in all I really love this laptop."
1369,"Bought this laptop with some apprehensions, as i have typically bought refurbished goods from apple directly. This was my first from amazon, and i was not disappointed. The notebook was flawless, not a single scratch on it. second, all the accessories where flawless as well, not signs of usage. When i powered on the notebook to verify usage, the battery had cycled only 3 times, meaning it was still in new condition. Very highly recommended seller. Thanks for a pleasant transaction."
1370,"This laptop looked new, straight from Apple store."
1371,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   The screen arrived damaged, what a scam.!"
1372,"Although I was very skeptical about purchasing a ""refurbished"" MacPro, after reading the reviews for this company, I made the purchase.  The MacPro arrived earlier than expected, expertly wrapped, included Apple certified, and in NEW condition.  There is no way I could tell it was not new or refurbished.  The price was the best I could find after researching other sellers.  I would highly recommend iPower Resale Inc to anyone looking for a MacPro.  Their customer service is exceptional.  Thank you for a great product!  5*****"
1373,"When I looked at this product it only had one review and it was a bad one... I then checked all the other products the seller sold and the reviews were excellent, needless to say I took a chance and ordered this MacBook Pro 2019. It arrived before anticipated and it was securely package. I AM SO GLAD I took a chance on them because this MacBook is amazing! Now I’ve waited a couple months before reviewing it to make sure it works. The MacBook looks brand new, it didn’t have any dents or scratches. It works and performs like a new MacBook. I had to contact the seller over the a small issue with the charger and they went above and beyond to correct the issue.Excellent customer service excellent product. I recommend this seller to anyone!"
1374,"I got my new MacBook Pro M1 two weeks ago and could not be more happy with it. This machine is absolutely incredible in terms of speed, looks, weight/size, display, and battery life - and texture (it feels so good against the skin on my wrists as I type) and basically anything else you can think of. I also love the space gray color, the new keyboard, the Touch Bar, and the larger trackpad. There are so many options to customize the system to work just the way I like.My previous MacBook was the 2011 model and it still works today, but after 10 years it became too slow and the trackpad had trouble clicking, so after a TON of research, I decided to pull the trigger and get the New MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.A couple suggestions I am able to give after spending almost two months and probably over 30 hours researching the new MacBook are: go with the standard model of 8gb of RAM and the 256 ssd - you can get this on Amazon for $1239 vs $1299 at Apple - so you get to save 60 bucks, and you have the added satisfaction of not having to deal with the snobby nerd losers that work in the Apple Store, who asked me rudely when I went in to get a new laptop ""umm, do you have an appointment? Well, you're going to have to make an appointment if you want to go in the store"". I love Apple products and will never use another phone or computer besides the iPhone and MacBook, but after that experience I will never again give my business to the physical Apple Stores. I mean, seriously, do you really need me to make an appointment to buy a $1300 laptop? Whatever dude.Anyway, in several YouTube videos that compared the 8GB ram model along side the 16GB ram model (costs 200 bucks more), the 8GB performed just as well in nearly every task - and they really pushed it to the limits. The only reason to pay up for the 16GB RAM is if you want to edit 8K UHD videos or are a super serious music recording artist or highly advanced professional photographer - and even then it's not too much of a difference. For the every day user (me or basically anyone who is not a computer professional) the 8GB working with this new M1 chip is mind-blowing, blows any other laptop on the market completely out of the water, and actually even performs just as well as the $2200 15 inch MacBook Pro using the Intel chip. As far as the storage goes, 256 ssd is standard - that's what I got - and you can pay 200 bucks more for 512 ssd or 400 bucks more for 1 TB. But with the Cloud storage available now, you don't really need to keep much on the laptop drive, you can just save it to the cloud.Overall I honestly could go on for hours about every little detail that I absolutely love about this machine. A free one year subscription to Apple TV is also another little perk. But I am still mystified every day at how incredible this machine is. I've been online for over 3 hours now and its still on 92% battery. The new Retina display is brilliant. Everything is perfect. I truly am in love this laptop and would recommend that anyone looking for a new laptop to last a long time and outperform everything else on the market gets the new matchbook 13 inch M1."
1375,I bought my Mac from Apple directly not from Amazon. This thing is amazing. Battery life is awesome. Hard to believe that I can work with it all day and do not have to charge at all even with bright screen.No issues with speed at all. I use Matlab a lot and this computer is even slightly faster than my desktop with 12 core AMD CPU and 32 GB ram.Excellent machine. Happy I bought it.
1376,"I own over 50 computers and it blows away my 11th gen Dell XPS 13 i7, My surface Book 3, my Ryzen 7 Thinkpad. the first week I got it the battery lasted for 5 days and 22 hrs of use and still had 20% left. I felt guilty and charged it. The Geekbench 5 rating beat all those listed laptops and they had 16 or 32GB of memory and the MacBook Pro M1 had only 8GB of unified memory. The keyboard felt great, the sound was superb, the screen bright, and it was blazing fast in all I did. I'm an IT consultant and deal in Windows based databases and this Mac has now become my daily go to system at home. It has become my new front end."
1377,It's a Mac once you go Mac you never go back. This is my second Mac my first lasted almost 9 years.
1378,Dead at arrival.... kernel error. Took it to the Apple store they told me looks like a hardware failure and to send it back to Amazon.
1379,"I'm going to preface this review with the 1 thing I dislike so we can get that out of the way.I mean let's be honest, that's what most people are looking for when buying a product-the down sides.It has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack EVEN THOUGH apple quit using that on it's handheld products years ago.Not that I care, it's good that they include the 3.5mm jack-but how come they didn't include one for their lightning connector that their headphones come in out of the box? Forces you to either change to a standard headphone jack or BT headphones (probably trying to push their AirPods line).Other than that, I have no issues. It's fast, efficient, reliable and easy to use. If your familiar with iOS on these then it'll be a great addition to the tech team you have at home."
1380,"I love my new MacBook Pro!!  It’s the 13” and not too small. It’s very lightweight!  It’s so fast!  I was using an older MacBook Pro from mid 2012. It worked well, just so slow. This one flies!!  I was disappointed that there are no USB ports or CD player. I spent about $65 at Best Buy and got an adapter that works very well!!!"
1381,The battery lasts forever and its fast. My last macbook had a pretty good battery and worked very well for years too.The M1 does allow for dual external monitors and there are two usbc ports total. These two things can be worked around with dongles and a video hub but now I have $200 worth of accessories and a tangled mess on my desk.How is a 2020 Mac not compatible with dual monitors but my 2005 HP works great with the same monitor setup?!? I really can't get past that.Get the intel version with 4 USB ports and you can use it in your Covid home office out of the box.
1382,"There is no fix for this, and now it can't be returned.  All that money wasted!!! There is a vertical black line on the screen.  I tried to fix it using tips from youtube videos and none of it worked.  Proceed with caution!"
1383,"I really wanted to love this laptop. I've had only Macs for years. This was supposed to be an upgrade from my 2014 MacBook Air. I previously had a 2020 16"" intel based MacBook Pro for work configured with two HP monitors. No issues with the monitors and connected instantly with zero effort to get the screens to work with the laptop. Bought this one and connected to my Belkin hub for the HDMIs. Would only connect a single monitor. Googled the issue and found that the new M1 apple chip only supports a single monitor. News to me and I guess I should have researched more. However the low rating stems from the fact that this is a PRO laptop. A professional would want two monitors and should not have to google whether a PRO laptop supports more than 1 monitor when the intel version does seamlessly. Despite this I had planned to keep it and just deal with 1 monitor because of the cost savings over buying the Intel based MacBook Pro and wanted the longer battery life. Now brings me to the issue that made me return the laptop. This laptop just would not configure to show a clear resolution with my monitors. The scale was off and the display just stayed blurry no matter what setting I changed it to on the monitor or the laptop's settings. Tried and tried and just gave up. Returned this and ordered an Intel based 13"" MacBook Pro. No issues, supports dual monitors, and seamlessly integrated to the laptop. No blurry screen and no having to set or change any settings to get it to work. I am floored that Apple would produce a Pro for business that only supports a single monitor. I love Apple but will not buy anything with their chip until the kinks are worked out."
1384,This is by far the best laptop ive ever owned! The laptop came with 0 scratches and only 16 battery charges on it. It even came with the apple box and stickers! Highly reccomend for the price. $850 is great for a 2019 macbook air.
1385,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Everything I expected and more! Just like brand new!"
1386,I love this laptop so so much. I think everyone should get it. The model is between 2018-2020 and the one I got had the Touch ID on it! Everything was very easy to set up and is in such great quality!
1387,"Received in a timely manner.  Will review in a couple weeks.Well, it's been over 2 weeks since receiving my MacBook Air and I have to admit that it has proven to be worth it's price. The Retina display is phenomenal and it's compact chassis is just what I was looking for. I am not a power user, so I didn't need major memory capacity. The speakers are, surprisingly, crisp and clear for such a slim build. The fingerprint scanner is quick and a huge convenience. I am (or was) a long-time PC user and resisted getting an Apple, but the transition was smooth and Apple's claim to fame for being user-friendly and intuitive proved true. If you are looking for a compact, yet capable laptop with QWERTY keyboard, I would recommend this product."
1388,"After having the laptop a few months, I can say my leap of faith to buy an amazon refurbished was worth it BUT I had to work a little bit.  It didn't arrive perfect and it still isn't perfect.  There is a tiny white dot on the screen where some pixels died (I guess) and when I first got it, I had to call Apple support to get iMessage and Facetime to work on it.  Then I had to take it to the Apple store to get the keyboard fixed as some keys would not work.  Thankfully, I had Apple Care on it so the cost to get it shipped off and fixed wasn't bad.  Overall, I am happy with my purchase and I recommend this seller, but I will probably buy new next time."
1389,"** I have only had the laptop for a week, this review is only based off of the time I have had it**I was so nervous to buy a refurbished computer but this came like it was brand new. New packaging, new charger, spotless laptop. I was worried the battery would be bad and wouldn’t hold a charge. I was wrong. I downloaded over 12,000 photos and was on it nonstop for over 2 days without even having to charge it. I am in love with this!!!"
1390,"As in the description exactly, thank the seller for the fast shipping and good packaging"
1391,I love this laptop and I’m really happy with all the features. Would definitely recommend.
1392,Exactly as expected. Great value.
1393,"The product made a loud buzzing/grinding airplane-type noise as soon as it finished setting up which was truly deafening. I presume it was the fan producing this aggravating sound. No programs were running and the room was approximately 68 degrees Fahrenheit so overheating should not have been an issue. Since no computer should ever sound like a coffee maker at any time, I must conclude that it was defective. Return to sender."
1394,Exceeded my expectations! Some of the reviews had me a bit nervous but I can’t tell you how happy I am! The laptop is on almost brand new condition! Only 1 TINY nick on the front (you can’t see it unless your looking) and it was perfectly ready for me to set up my account! No issues or problems! It comes in a box perfectly protected and has the charger to go with as well👍🏼 So happy with it! Thank you!
1395,"I was so excited because this laptop came in perfect condition. But when I tried to change the unsername to my name it wouldn’t work. 3 calls to Apple later, and I find out this computer is owned by a school that can remotely access my laptop at any time. Meaning, if they wanted to they could shut down and erase my laptop. Amazon gave me a full refund but I am very sad and disappointed"
1396,"All in all, the laptop works great! It runs fast, it’s clean, and it’s perfect for what I needed it. The one disappointment I have it they claimed this product as a catagory A which means like new. When it arrived, the screen had two scratch marks on it that was discolored from the rest of the screen. I would understand like new for any other part to have a scratch, but the screen is a big deal and it should have mentioned that in the details."
1397,"This MacBook Air is amazing!  I had been previously using a 2007 MacBook Air and it was time to upgrade.  I have never purchased refurbished before so I really didn't know what to expect, though was greatly concerned.  Needless to say that this laptop heavily exceeded my expectations.  Other reviewers stated that their MacBook was not as described, though mine looks brand new.  The keys are still crisp and clean, the screen immaculate.  There are a few light scratches on the outside of the computer (mostly the underside), but it is very minimal and unnoticeable.It runs like a dream, though I have only begun using it.  I will update should the computer have any issues.  It is an early 2015 with 4 GB RAM and its OS is Sierra.  I wanted to share that, as I found the Q&A to be a little confusing on that point and other reviews didn't really mention it."
1398,"When I received this package, I was thrilled...until I tried to turn it on and got a “low battery” notification...for 16+ hours. Turns out the cord provided (not a Mac product) is not the correct wattage to charge this device. It’s hard to tell at this point if the computer is faulty or not now that I’ve purchased a new cord from Best Buy, but it shuts down as soon as it’s disconnected from power. The screen is pretty floppy, too- falls back without provocation. All of which seem like things that should have been mentioned in the details before I decided to purchase.After taking this computer to the Apple store, I was informed that the issue was indeed the battery- completely bad and had to be replaced. Again, something that I wish I had known before purchasing. It is in working order now, but doesn’t meet my standards of what “certified refurbished” means, and product details lacking for sufficient purchasing knowledge ahead of time."
1399,"It said I had to do an update. When I hit the only update allowed it said the latest version was already installed but it wouldn’t let me go foward.  Also the screen seemed loose.  So if it was cleared out they never installed the new software correctly. So it wouldn’t let me even get to the main screen.  Others had luck but I did not.Also when I plugged the power bar in. It had a bit of a shock come out. As an electrician, I know that was a big no no.  I was willing to spend the money and get the correct power cord. But with everything else. I thought that’s already 3 strikes. No thanks."
1400,I was very hesitant buying a used MacBook from Amazon but it turned out great! Looks new and works amazingly. You will receive exactly what was described. I have no complaints!
1401,"Good quality, arrived early. As-new condition. Easy to install from my old machine via time machine backup. The old one was a 2010, now we are good for another 5-7 years.Thanks"
1402,I have been struggling with this product since day one. I am not getting responses from the seller OR the extended warranty repair company.I have never had trouble with Amazon before. Every issue I have ever had has been settled with ease and courtesy.This has not. Made more devastating as it it is the largest purchase I have had and the product has been unusable almost since day one. We sent it to the extended warranty place who said they fixed it but it still doesn’t work.We have spent hours at Apple doing diagnostics and it is simply not functional. To repair it would cost more than I paid. They do not think that the parts it was refurbished with are even Apple parts.This was a terrible product and not worth the money.
1403,"I bought this Mac and it came with a non Apple charger, I bought this as travel computer, sure enough in the first week while I was in Europe I had to buy am authentic Apple charger at $117. Now a month  later my Mac has died. It was having issues as in when I tried to maximize the scene with Netflix it would just shrink to a 3x5"" screen volume,  also the screen had been replaced before I bought it and is not well attached, very disappointed, I bought this last summer, but only started to use it in October when I was traveling, so I spent close to $700 for a Mac that lasted 2 months, return and replacement window has ""closed"" so I am stuck with a hefty repair bill."
1404,"Was very iffy about buying refurbished but it’s honestly like new! There are a couple of LITTLE scratches but nothing noticeable! Compared to my friends MacBook Air that she paid 1100$ for and they are the absolute same. Best $500 I’ve ever spent. & the company is AWESOME! The charger didn’t work as soon as I got it & I emailed them. Within an hour I had an email from them and they were sending me a new charger, thankful my friend had her charger that I used until I received mine but the battery last like 2-3 days so it wasn’t that bad."
1405,"Seller: IT5050Wowie! My son wanted an Apple Computer for Christmas and I was not about to spend $1000+ on a laptop for a 11-year-old boy. But a refurbished MacBook was definitely priced more appropriate for him. This computer is AMAZING people!!! Looks so clean and new. Only a couple faint scratches on the bottom, the keyboard looks like it was hardly touched, screen is clear and no burn marks in it, plus the battery is great. The seller was so awesome to get me this gift in time for Christmas, they are quick to respond to emails and followed up to make sure it was delivered afterward. (seriously, the nicest people!) I had purchased another renewed MacBook from another seller, and their level of quality wasn’t as good, by far. I wish I could pre-select a quality grade for the laptop (excellent, good, fair, etc.), so it is a little scary just leaving it up to the unknown. I work in the retail business and I like to applaud small companies who sell quality products. Do yourself a favor and go here, they gave me a laptop that is stellar and eased my worries about a refurbished laptop. It really looks so good and is operating perfectly. This is such a smarter way to buy a computer, especially for kids, or if you like to have the pricier brands without spending the high price. – Happy Mommy!"
1406,"Wow! Bought this from TECHarvard and was claimed to be Certified Refurbished, which according to the Amazon description should show limited to no signs of wear.  Well the device that I received not only was pretty scratched on the bottom, had a huge ding on the corner of the top cover, but the keyboard showed more signs of wear than the MacBook that I've had for 5 years(Space bar was completely warped).  Definitely does not resemble a new device in any way shape or form.  If they are selling used devices, call them used and mark the price down accordingly.  This is definitely going back."
1407,"Overall the laptop is nice. A couple of marks on the outside but works relatively well. There was an issue with the battery that originally came with it. It would shut off around 65% battery life. I asked the seller for a replacement battery, which they gave to me free of charge. However, the replacement battery is not originally an Apple battery and instead a knock off. This issue prompted it to restart randomly no matter what the battery life was at. I’m putting the original battery back in and having Apple replace it with the appropriate battery for an additional fee. I got what a paid for and I won’t make the mistake of buying a refurbished Apple product from anywhere other than the Apple store again."
1408,This is the BEST purchase I’ve ever made! The laptop 💻 arrived on time and in MINT condition. It functions beautifully and works flawlessly for my personal and business needs. I would recommend this seller to any & all I know who are in the market for reliable and affordable devices.
1409,"Battery doesnt work! I travel to another country with the laptop and web I turned on and unplug it, it shuts down! And in Battery Options appears ""Replace now"". How you can help me? I'm in Ecuador now and wont be back in a year!"
1410,"I love my new MacBook Air, it came as expected (relatively like new condition). This my first Mac and I’d purchase it again refurbished, you save greatly and get almost the same product 😀"
1411,Bought certified refurbished ended up with a unit with a screen covered in dead pixels. I contacted apple to see how much a screen replacement should be more I'm looking a repair cost more than I paid for the laptop.
1412,"DO NOT BUY!!! I purchased this computer for about two month and one day I couldn’t turn it on after it goes into sleep mode for a long time. It just wouldn’t turn no matter what I do, I tried every single method out there. I had to press the power button a hundred times for it to finally turn on. But after a while even that won’t work. The computer is just dead. I had to take it to the computer store and they told me it costs $434 to fix it!!!! Even though I actually paid to get it fixed I recommend everyone do not buy!! It’s not worth the money and will cost you more!! The guy in the computer store told me that there is corrosion inside the motherboard and in order to fix it it costs a lot of money ($434). I am truly upset and wished I would have just bought a brand new one from apple that’s the newest version and which will cost me less than what I spent on this computer!!"
1413,"The laptop worked great the first week. Eventually, things started to decline and quickly.  I would constantly have to change the time clock, and that would prevent many apps from working properly or not at all. I also discovered that my webcam did not work. I asked customer service if I could get a replacement laptop, and they gave me a website to help me fix it myself. It did not work. Also, the computer would start dying very quickly, even after a full charge. I would also not start up automatically, even with the charger plugged in. I had to press to start button almost endlessly for it to just power on. Eventually, it just would not cut on at all, even with the charger plugged in. It’s completely dead. Apple says that it should cut on with the charger plugged in if it were a battery issue, so it’s definitely something wrong with it beyond that and it will cost upwards of $400 to fix. I’m totally bummed. It did not even last a year."
1414,"BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY MOTHER, SHE IS 70 YEARS OLD AND BARELY USES THE LAPTOP.THE SCREEN IS IN THIS STATE, APPEARS TO BE PEELING! VERY BAD!!"

   Note: My purchase was completed through Kanga Supply for this item that ultimately doesn't function as intended.Amazon Renewed item descriptions indicate that the products should work and look like new, which wasn’t the case for this purchase, ergo my poor rating. After only having the Macbook for less than a day, I was forced to reach out to the seller because the product no longer functioned as intended.CONSThe Macbook worked fine for the first hour or so of use, but during an update, the screen flickered vigorously (see video). I hoped it was just a fluke, and it led me to believe there may be some software or hardware-related issue. After having the Macbook for less than 12 hours, I was forced to reach out to the seller because the screen flickering caused the laptop to become unusable (see picture). I also came here to draft a review in hopes that my issue is resolved quickly and effectively. I'll update my review once this is complete.PROSAfter removing the laptop and inspecting the outside, I was pleased. The outside of the Macbook is in good condition, just one or two visible scratches or marks.The charger was not the original Apple charger (as other reviews have indicated) but an OEM adapter. I don’t care that much about whether it’s an Apple charger, as long as it functions.Specs match the advertised item I purchased:128GB SSD8GB ramEDIT/UPDATE: After reaching out to the seller as instructed with the Amazon Renewed products, I never got a response in the allotted timeframe (2 business days) and was forced to reach out to Amazon directly. Ultimately, this item was returned for a refund.UPDATE 2: Today is 1/13/2020 and I have still yet to see this problem resolved to my satisfaction (refund or exchange of working product), after having ordered this product on 12/26/2019. Highly disappointed both in Amazon and the third-party seller.UPDATE 3: Received a replacement Macbook on 1/15/2020. So far it seems to be working, no issues with the screen per the previous item received (was NOT the same item sent back, verified by serial number). Pleased so far with this item."
1416,"The 2015 Macbook Pro is still, in my opinion, the best Macbook even in 2019.  I use the SD card reader all the time and have several USB 3.0 devices.  I also use a newer 2017 quad-core i7 for work (no choice) but the difference in speed is not worth the added money and lacking ports.  When I actually put the newer 2017 to work, the heat issue is still a challenge for Apple and performance drops.  It's like having power that I can't actually use unless I sit in a walk-in freezer. Don't quote benchmark speed tests to me, what counts is actual performance sitting at my desk for hours at a time working on a project. I also prefer the magsafe power (although this one uses the magsafe II which I like less than magsafe I which had a more solid connection) This one, I purchased for my wife and it handles everything she needs it to do. Although you can't upgrade the memory on these models, so make sure you get enough for what you need.  If you want to change out memory, then the best choice is the Mid 2012 non-retina model which also come with DVD drives and has USB 3.0 ports."
1417,"First off, I am removing a star because they shipped a counterfeit 60W Magsafe 2 charger with my order. I contacted them immediately and they offered to accept a return of everything. I explained that the charger was my only complaint and they overnight FedEx'd a genuine Apple replacement for free.""we sent you the wrong adapter for this batch of order and will overnight you the correct genuine one.""So they knowingly ship counterfeit chargers with some of their orders?The computer is pretty good cosmetically and operationally, but not as great as other reviewers. It is an Early-2015 12,1 model, this one was built in 12/2016. There is a crease over the right USB port from somebody yanking a USB plug. The battery has 107 cycles (89% life left). Keyboard and display are in great shape with no flaws. The SSD has no dead cells. It came with MacOS 10.13 installed.Overall its a good laptop and decent refurbishment job.EDIT: Knocking off another star. They sent me another counterfeit charger. Apple would never loosely jumble the cord in the box, a genuine power supply doesn't stay powered on for several seconds after it's unplugged from the main or stay lit green/orange after its unplugged from the laptop and this fake only puts out 25 watts max."
1418,"I really feel like I got a great deal on this, mine arrived in brand new condition and it looked like it had never been used. I did see some people had bad experiences but mine was well worth the price tag. The only negative was that the charger provided is third party and not OEM Apple. The box is also generic and not Apple, not a big deal but you just don't get that same feeling opening it up as a new product. I will say that I checked the serial number on Apple and the computer itself was only a couple of years old, so in reality I paid around $450 for an Apple that was only a couple of years old with a decent amount of battery life still left. I only bought this as there was certain tasks that I could not do on my iPad and so I did not need a brand new super powerful computer. This one is great, does not get hot, fans are silent and the display looks incredible.Overall I was very happy with the purchase, it came fast and was like new condition at the fraction of the cost of a new one. I actually waited a few months before writing this review so that I could also include that I have had no issues at all in that time, battery lasts a decent amount of time and no software or hardware issues to report. It also runs the latest OS that I updated it to and I believe it will be supported software wise for some time to come. Completely worth the price!"
1419,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   The Macbook came in working condition with all original components and an OEM charger but not with the extension cord. The major downfall is the condition of the laptop, for the above average asking price for this model I expected great condition as it is stated to be like new but instead the model I received was in okay condition (not cleaned either, large collection of gunk in hinge vent) at best with a lot of edge scratches and deep cuts throughout the chassis, and some unremovable stains from stickers! And worst of all the battery was at over 500 cylces, the battery life was 4-5 hrs max! thats horrible for whats suppose to be a renewed device! Not satisfied!EDIT:  Avoid this entire listing especially from the seller ''Easymobiledevices'', they ship dirty grade b laptop and have poor costumer service."
1420,Once i started running it all sort of problems arises. First major problem is wifi drops off and will not let you connect to wifi. After this happens you cant even turn on/off the wifi. Used guest and still no wifi. Restarting or shutdown and restart will not activate wifi. If you restart it takes so long to reboot. Sometimes it get stuck on the waiting wheel on startup. One out of ten restart wifi will work for a minute but then drops off and you will no longer be able to connect again. I cant say anything physically because it looks fine. Lastly beware it shows and says freshly installed mojave os but it has instead sierra installed. The power cord looks like an imitation and not the original one because from the weight it is not the original one. I can tell because i have multiple macbook at home and that is not the original one. I am pretty disappointed with this seller.
1421,"I’ll update 15 days from today.CONS:-Delivery packaging: it was a regular box with one thick bubble wrap to protect the laptop.First glance, the charger seems pretty beat up but seems to work fine.-The outer top of the laptop has a lot of scuff marks and scratches. Sides do as well. Nothing TOO severe.-Bottom have some scratches and wearing on the rubber, not too noticeable.PROS:-Had a full battery-Set up went smoothly with no hiccups.-Outer signature glowing Apple works well.-Opening the laptop, the screen has no visible scratches, cracks, or scuffs at all.-Keyboard has no loose keys and is glowing well.-Trackpad has no scratches and works really well no weird working sides SO FAR.-Software automatically updated to Catalina, kinda wanna wait to update to Big Sur.I’ll update March 13, 2021"
1422,"Still a GREAT LAPTOP, arguably the best MacBook Pro 13” ever made, 2 or 3 iterations later! I have had mine for 3 months now and although I was a little disappointed that I got a no-brand MagSafe power brick instead of an Apple brand, it’s caused no problems for me. I have been using Logic Pro X a lot and it runs nice and smooth even with the haphazard way I use it, leaving muted unused tracks all over the place as I learn about things like track bouncing and experiment with every single effect and different audio formats (I feel bad sometimes like I am unnecessarily abusing the laptop, lol) and I haven’t frozen or crashed at all. I have used a few emulation programs for old Saturn, Super Famicom, PS and Dreemcast games that push the 2D sprite and parallax scrolling envelope and again I haven’t had any problems. Only thing I have experienced that has been an issue is the actual Mac OS and it’s limitations with regard to formats, programs that it supports and connectivity with outside developers but I have also been able to get around that by setting Virtual Machines up and GUID partitioning to use whatever other OS I need. This is also not a complaint about the hardware itself but rather the Mac OS software so should not be considered when it comes to the actual MacBook Pro 13”.You will want to upgrade to an NVME M2 SSD at least 256 GB or 512 GB right away, as the 128 GB SSD will fill up within 2-3 months of moderate use and the newer M2s will increase the OS loading speed more than anything else. Luckily you have your pick of great SSDs like the Samsung 970 Evo, etc that you can easily swap in with a $5 adapter, a screwdriver and no soldering (just search YouTube for “MB Pro 13 2015 SSD upgrade”)…The unique things and PROS about this MB Pro 13” are the older style KEYBOARD that doesn’t break like 2016-later model keyboards do, 2 USB 3 ports, an SD CARD R/W and a FULL SIZE HDMI PORT all built in. This is the last MB Pro 13 with any of those ports on board and the fact that you can swap SSD hard drives with no soldering and very little skill needed, all-in with the M2 you get a sexy little powerhouse for half the price of the newer model Pro 13”s (1/4 price of current gen)! The rest (CPU, onboard graphics, sound/speakers) make this laptop a must have that will likely only appreciate in value $$$!Two Thunderbolt 2/miniDisplayPorts are useful if you want to setup 2-3 Screens, but the CONS Are that you get NO ThunderBolt 3/USB-C ports and more and more adapters and devices require that connection these days, though with the USB 3 ports there are ways around it, complicated as they may be. You also CANNOT UPGRADE RAM unless you know how to de-solder the current ram and solder up new ram (accepts up to 16GB DDR-3 in 2X8GB formation) and setup the machine to accept the new ram, which seems a recipe to completely destroy the board/laptop without at least some Mac building & Mac hardware programming know-how, possibly even special equipment.MAKE SURE YOU GET THE MODEL WITH THE AMOUNT OF RAM YOU NEED BUILT IN & a CPU that will be sufficient for you and you won’t be disappointed with this awesome little 6 year old laptop! Don’t get the 4 GB model even if it will “work” for you “short-term”! I got the 8GB/i5 2.9Ghz/128GB and I already regret not paying another $100 for the 16GB ram model, but c’est la vie.Just buy this MacBook Pro 13” while you can, replace the SSD as soon as possible, enjoy it, keep it another 5-10 years and you will likely be able to triple your investment by reselling it assuming Apple stays on their current trajectory with their MB Pro Hardware releases!!!"
1423,"Hi, I bought this Macbook Pro 13"" early 2015 and received last week on Aug 23th. The laptop has a good appearance and doesn't have any flaws. However, the charger(45w) packed together with the macbook is not for macbook pro but for  Macbook Air. I just found out today, cuz when I use the charger(45w) laptop cpu temperatures goes up to 65-85 celcius. and I can't use more than 4 hours. But when I charge my macbook with Macsafe 1 (85w, which is for Pro), the cpu temperature keeps 40-50 degree, and it runs around 10hours. I want to change my charger into “MacBook Pro Charger 85w”. Thank you."
1424,I'm very dissatisfied with this purchase.I can't use the Mac because the hard drive was not reset and the software on the Mac dose not allow you to use it.Also there was no charger.Again very disappointed.
1425,"Looks brand new, wrapped and sealed in Apple packaging. Plugged it in and turned it on and let it go. Absolutely no problems, it was automatic and wonderful to have the computer set itself up. Has performed flawlessly as expected of an Apple laptop."
1426,"The laptop arrived in fair condition.  The screws show signs of wear so it may have been opened up during the ""renewal"" process.  Old stickers were left on the bottom. Also, the laptop was shipped with a cheap knockoff Chinese charger.  I have no reason to trust this charger so I'll have to order a genuine Apple one instead.Fortunately I don't need this machine to be a workhorse or I would send it back.  This should survive a year at least but I don't trust it as-is - I will wipe the hard disk, NVRAM, and SMC just to be safe."
1427,Product was faulty. The charging port wouldn't hold the plug. I returned it. I don't think the refurbishing process is very competent.
1428,"This is exactly like the MacBook I was given for work that was stolen on a plane flight. No problems with this as a replacement so far, smooth sailing for 3 months already! I got the protection plan just in case, but I'm very satisfied with this cheaper than new replacement. Will update if there are any issues that arise. Would recommend."
1429,"Idk what I was thinking not having an apple in the first place. This laptop is very easy to use, fast, and I’m excited to see how productive I can be with this format. I feel free, nothing holding me back now!! Unlike old pc with unresponsive interface, slow speeds, and constant crashes, this one gives me no problems!!"
1430,This laptop was literally like brand new out of the box. So far my daughter is so thrilled with her graduation gift. She is ready for college now!!!
1431,"Our first ever Mac but so far its been quite impressive. It was easy to setup and get it going. It works well and very easy to use, turn on/off, carry around and day to day life. Wish the battery would last a bit longer."
1432,"BUYER BEWARE!I knew by choosing a refurbished computer, I was taking a risk, but I never expected this. When I received this MacBook Air, I was surprised it was the model Apple stopped making in 2017, since the title said “Newest Version.” I emailed the seller and they said Amazon forced that in the title and told me I could return it. I work full time, am in grad school, and have three kids. I figured with it being an Apple it would last long enough to get me through school, so I kept it. Now, six months later the screen won’t turn on. It’s completely black.I am able to connect to an external monitor and use the computer that way, so I know it’s the display. After trying to adjust the brightness, several resets, resetting the SMC and the PRAM, I called Apple Support. They ruled out all software issues and told me it had to be the hardware.At this point I contacted the seller and they basically told me “sorry, it’s outside of the 90 day window so there’s nothing we will do for you.” I have escalated to Amazon trying to get some kind of resolution. They just confirmed there is nothing they are willing to do for me. They also are not doing anything to penalize the seller, All Out Apple. I'm shocked at Amazon. Shady sellers like All Out Apple will always be around, but I really thought Amazon was better than Ebay in that way. Lesson Learned.There is no reason a MacBook Air should have a display of a completely stops functioning after six months of use, even refurbished. I’m grateful that I had a work-provided monitor I can plug into to do my schoolwork, but if I was aiming to be tethered to my desk, I would have bought a Mac Mini."
1433,"Got the computer two days early! this was probably the fastest delivery I've ever received from amazon. I wasn't going to buy refurbished but I really wanted another MacBook and shelling out $2k for a new one was simply out of the question. When I saw the price for this MacBook Air, I decided to roll the dice and buy it. I knew it could possibly come not as advertised, such as having scratches or not being updated as far as software is concerned but when I opened it up it was practically BRAND NEW! set up was simple as can be! only took me 5 minutes to sign in with my Apple ID and all my information was synced between my iPhone and iPad and onto the MacBook Air. There were a few minor scratches less than a couple centimeters on the bottom of the computer nothing that noticeable. the charger doesn't stick as well as I'd like and one of the hinges is half broken off but I've that same issue with practically every MacBook I've ever had. I was really surprised with the quality. it said 2017 version but with all the updates and new iterations its hard to gauge which MacBook your getting I thought I was purchasing a much older MacBook Air than what I got this thing is amazing and the 13 in screen is far larger than I expected it to be feels like a 15 or 17 in display when having it in your hands/ the computer itself is incredibly light, the main reason I chose the air you can carry it in anywhere with one hand and hardly feel it definitely much lighter than my 2020 iPad 11"" All in all if you're on a budget, this computer is the way to go! for $400 its practically brand new and runs like a dream! thanks amazon for this incredible refurbished Mac! love it !"
1434,"I don’t what to think I bought 2017 16gb 256 ssd but I received a refurbished 2019 8g 256 perfectly packaged, I can’t put apple care I already call for that but im not sure to keep it because I want a computer of 16of ram but this one is 2019, im gonna give the chance to see how it works, And it cost me the same price of a refurbished 2019 Of apple but those ones you can put apple care"
1435,"hola, soy de peru. Estoy contento con la compra, la compre por el precio, y me llego tal cual las especificaciones.(late2018,2.3gz,8ram,256ssd). la bateria llego con 350 ciclos aproxen cuanto a lo estetico, tenia pequeños arañones en un costado, pero nada grave, la pantalla intacta y el touchbar ok. el cargador sellado oem.califico la compra como 9/10."
1436,Got a few months out of this before the screen started disappearing intermittently. Then it wasn't so intermittent. I'd have much rather spent the extra money to get a new computer that didn't break than to buy something second-hand and have to decide to repair or replace.
1437,"Considering I was 100% ripped off, I would not recommend you purchase from this seller, I did not receive what I wanted, the serial number for a COMPUTER comes up as an iPhone 11... Just.. No."
1438,This computer was working fine and all of a sudden the screen went out.  Cost me $640 to fix it.
1439,"Delivery was super fast, considering I’m in South Africa. The laptop is simply beautiful, woks well, no complaints, I love it."
1440,"Positivo, EXCELENTE EQUIPO!!!"
1441,So far this was a steal. Great product for a great value.
1442,super machine
1443,The space key and some of the keys were not working As they are supposed to. Really sticky
1444,"Arrived, boxed well with balloon cushions. Power adapter looked clean but had scratches. Opened up the Lid of the MacBookPro and it looked like it had some sort of disease or cancer & it smelled quite strange too. It had over 50% battery so I carried on with a reset which resulted in an error. Luckily it booted back into Yosemite OS that it had installed years ago, after 3 failed attempts managed to update to Mojave. Of course first things first copy music etc onto, USB stick struggled to go in either of the USB Ports (look at the photos) was also stuck after insertion but managed to pull out, with a hard pull - full force - anger. Had a look into the ports and discovered they were literally rusted dirty like disgusting, this is not the definition of Refurbished - but 2nd Hand or Heavily Used. Be aware, set your expectations right in oder to avoid any disappointments."
1445,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I was super stoked upon arrival, began setting up the laptop and within minutes the screen stopped working. Literally pixels. Severely disappointed. I have gotten ahold of kanga and they are working to replace the device but it has now been over a week since I’ve purchased the unit with two day shipping and still have nothing to show for it. I hope they come through on their end and send me a functional unit."
1446,"I've only had it for about a week now and this 2015 MacBook Pro is working phenomenally! I was kinda hesitant buying a refurbished MacBook from Amazon, but I can honestly say I'm go glad I went ahead and did. It came extremely fast and right from opening the box, it was as if I had bought a brand new one right from Apple themselves. There's not a scratch, dent, stain, dust or anything on it. So far it's working extremely well and I will definitely buy form this seller in the future and recommend them to others as well! Great price for a great computer."
1447,"I’ve had this MacBook Pro going on 4 days and so far so good! It has met all my expectations and more. I grew up using windows PCs. This is my first Apple computer and I’m happy to have made the transition. Wish I did this long time ago but better late then never. If it wasn’t for the packaging and not being in the original box, I probably wouldn’t be able to tell this was refurbished. This is just based from my experience using MacBooks at the Apple store. Also, there was a few minor scratches on the bottom of the laptop.I will revise and change review in a month if any problems. But as of now, my review above is how I feel."
1448,"I've only had it for a couple days, but so far this is a great purchase. The thing looks brand new, and I know it isn't. I am replacing an older Mac and just can't afford the prices of new machines from Apple. Using Migration Assistant (an app that comes with Macs) I was able to restore a time machine backup from the old machine, so I've lost nothing in the transition."
1449,"When I ordered this product for the first time, it came with a green line on the screen. I contacted the costumer service, they responded very quickly and replaced it.The second computer came with better specs, I was the happiest person... for 2 months though, the computer suddenly stop responding.Other things that are worth saying:- The charger is generic. A generic charger can easily damage the battery of the computer, that could explain my problem.- The second computer they sent, had a sticker that covered the whole low part of the computer (those stickers that are the same color as the computer and are used to cover up very big scratches.Conclusion: they can deliver a great costumer service, but not a working product."
1450,"The macbook pro only worked for a short while. It had a charging/powering problem - wouldn't keep a charge at first, then wouldn't power on even when plugged in. Confirmed it was not a charger issue.I contacted the company who said to send it back for repair. Once they received it they wrote saying it cannot be fixed and charged me a ""restocking fee"" in the amount of the purchase of the laptop. Outrageous!! I even had a protection plan for it. After numerous interactions they refused to help and returned the laptop without telling me. THEN they said they couldn't do anything in terms of a refund because I had the machine. Months later they refuse to resolve it and amazon can't help me because it's a third party seller. An ABSOLUTE JOKE of a company. I'm out over $500.00 with a computer that can't be fixed - and Apple store said they could try but for more than the computer's worth. So yeah. They have my money and I have nothing.DO NOT BUY from these people if you'd like to keep your money."
1451,"Hey all! So I’ve gotten into photography lately and needed a upgrade from my old 2012 MacBook Pro and 2011 Asus laptops for editing. Figured a 2015 model would be the way to go for a decent upgrade without spending tons of money. I was super skeptical about buying a reconditioned one through Amazon after reading the reviews and thought about it for about 4 hours before I made the transaction. Next day it was at my door step with me a bit nervous about opening the package and seeing a beat up MacBook, I opened the box and the MacBook was in a bubble wrapped sleeve and that’s it. Okay I’m fine with that but what was the condition of it? Looks like it barely got used or the previous owner always had a case on it. Outside from a few nicks here and there it’s flawless. Turns on and is super quick, the Retina display is beautiful and definitely enjoyable to watch movies. It came with Mojave so the first thing I did was update it to Big Sur and it’s still flawless. I’ve only had it for a day if that but so far I’m happy with my purchase. Just be mindful yours may or may not be like mine condition wise I got lucky. Should you buy one of these? I would I’m pleased with my purchase and I’m sure you would be too. But I’ll update with any issues if they come up in the future. Thankfully I’m a bit tech savvy so whatever happens I’m sure I can fix it."
1452,"This of course this is an old model and reconditioned/renewed, so I was expecting it to look somewhat used; however, this MacBook Pro is in PERFECT CONDITION as if I had purchased it new. I'm upgrading from a very heavy and slow 2009 white MacBook that's a dinosaur and I could only do very basic things on it. It has almost zero capability in terms of battery life (it could only be used plugged in) so this laptop is an absolute gem in comparison. This might be why I'm so hyped and elated. Plus the price was very good. *I hope the computer doesn't have some sudden glitch and dies on me...lol!Now, I can finally edit my videos in iMovie, which was not working on the old MacBook, because I couldn't update it anymore. I need this laptop mainly for traveling, to do editing work, I have a 2 monitor PC set-up at home. My only wish is that I could transfer my Adobe CS to the new laptop.SIDE NOTE: it's actually overall a little smaller than my old 13"" (screen size is the same), it's not as heavy, but not as light as the Air; it arrived with Catalina iOS installed and I had to upgrade to Monterey to use the newest version of iMovie - this isn't a complaint, just an observation."
1453,"I bought for my mom, great deal (sort-of), works great (after I deleted 2 mysterious old unknown wifi connections)I bought this for my mom, she was always having Windows problems, viruses disguised as virus removal, scammy pop-ups, and so on.  Happy day!  :DThey raised prices during Prime Day, wth?  I thought I was getting a good deal, but afterward I noticed the price went down.  Anyway, I ordered this for my mom.  She's been using Windows and I wanted her to experience a Macbook Pro.  This one is actually even better than mine!  I'm still happily using a Late 2013 2.4 Ghz 8 RAM 256 GB 13-inch Retina, her's is exactly the same except it's a Early 2015 and it's actually got 2.7 Ghz!  Anyway she seems really happy with it.  I set it up for her, and ran the serial number, which was not found, not surprisingly although I'm not sure what that means, and the update page in the App Store looks like it was coded in 1995, so I'm not sure what's up with that.  Could be something funky going on, but all I know is it works and we're happy with it.  She's getting used to using it, and she says it's fast and smooth.  She was getting tired of all the Windows updates and virus stuff and all the spammy popups telling her to purchase a virus disguised as virus removal, yadda yadda yadda, so I am well-pleased that she is now almost a full-blown Mac-head.  Thanks Apple.  I hope to be able to afford an Apple car when they do come out, haha.  I'm not sure about the battery-life yet, but I HAD TO replace the battery on mine, so replacing it on hers should not be a problem."
1454,It’s just one continuous problem after the other with this computer. It’s really not worth it to save a little bit of money just buy new not refurbished have your warrantee you’re better off in the long run.
1455,For this being my first ever Mac- This was an amazing buy... no scratches or dents. Its basically BRAND NEW. 😝😝😝The only thing is that it says 512gb but the space says 256gb so be wary of that.But other than that I am really happy with my purchase.
1456,Good
1457,Love it
1458,"the product arrived with the screen broken. I would like a refund of $ 400 to repair it, since he is now in Brazil."
1459,So happy with this purchase. Even my kids said it looks like the new ones. Has some minor imperfections but at the cost totally acceptable. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.
1460,"I purchased through amazon this m1 chip 512 gb 8ram macbook pro 2020 year manufacture.  I’m a mac user of many years.  The computer is blazing fast, slim, light with great battery life. A huge bonus—-little need for additional  anti virus add on software since the macbook anti virus platform is very solid. A hidden gem when you buy any apple device is phenomenal tech telephone support.  The advisors at the apple stores and by telephone are the best part of the apple experience for me and even rival the devices they sell. Yes, I hate the high prices and know the game but over time I’ve  accepted their price points because of the incredible tech support."
1461,battery would not take any charge  stuck at 1%
1462,"I cannot believe the condition my Macbook is in, you can’t even tell if it’s used and the packaging was very nice and professional with the white box and wrapped just like it is when you get it directly from Apple. I am super happy with my purchase, thanks Amazon."
1463,"Good, but it is a little small.. easy to control. Recommend if you are hard to control your computer"
1464,Computer will not charge.
1465,"""Refurbished"" even though Battery life was non existent from the startup, always check the reviews on laptops to make sure they have over 200, cause then you won't be played by greedy ass people like I was"
1466,"Minor scratches , for the price reduction is a great buy !!!"
