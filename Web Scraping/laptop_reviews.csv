0,We are very satisfied with this computer.  It has been several years since we purchased a lap top.  So far--this has been very good to work with.  It is so much faster.  This brand came highly recommended by someone in the tech.field.  Nothing negative to say.
1,"It took me 3-4 hours to get a new printer on my home network because of Windows 11 S. The folks at Canon were very helpful but ultimately I had to turn it over to Microsoft to setup Windows 11. Windows 11 S will only allow you to add Microsoft Apps and doesn't allow networking. I really like the Lenovo laptop but this should be a toggle to switch out of Safe mode. Microsoft prefers you use only their apps in order to avoid potential pitfalls with generic apps. Also this laptop does not have a CD/DVD Drive. I wanted to load my copy of Home and Business 2010 office but Microsoft no longer supports the app so I had to ""rent"" new Office at a initial cost of $70 a year. Screen quality is great and I really like the touch screen"
2,Got this laptop bcuz of windows 11 while unboxing it i realised it had windows 10 safe mode sigh.
3,Easy to setup and great design
4,"I really like it, I use it for online teaching.  It is great, the hdmi access is so much easier."
5,"So far I like it but as the headline states, it doesn't have windows 11 installed, only window 10 in safe mode.  Update: easily upgraded to Windows 11."
6,Clean lines and extremely functional. Very Happy with the speed and performance. I would recommend it for the daily user.
7,"Unfortunately,  I didn't need this item, but heard it was a great find. I was able to get my current laptop fixed"
8,The affordable prices....
9,Cheap maid. Did not like it for the money @!!
10,"I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!"
11,"This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop."
12,"A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as ""basic needs"" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to ""S Mode"" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?"
13,"A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend."
14,BUYER BE AWARE: This computer has Microsoft 10S. This is scam software by Microsoft to force you to use only Microsoft apps from their deserted island wasteland of an app store. The computer will not allow you to do anything else. You can upgrade to a full version of Microsoft 10... for another $134. Hard pass. STAY AWAY from ALL computers with Microsoft 10S!! Absolute garbage software.
15,"I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and ""safe."" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be."
16,It runs amazing
17,"*UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant ."
18,"The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5"" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5"" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an ""upgrade your edition of Windows"" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the ""Go to the Store"" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the ""helpful"" button! Thank you!"
19,"I bought this laptop for its weight and that's about the only thing positive I can say about it.The processing power is not very strong, so performance-wise, I was not impressed. But with the pricetag considered, I'm all right with this.However, the biggest thing for me is the OS- WINDOWS 10-IN S MODE.I had never heard of S Mode, and I didn't notice this when I bought the laptop.Apparently, S Mode is Microsoft's way of ensuring that you only use their apps and products by blocking you from downloading any outside apps. You have to get them all through their store. So, for example, were I to try to download Norton's anti-virus from Norton's official site, Microsoft's S Mode would tell me that I am unable. Any and all files outside of their store are blocked from being downloaded.In order to leave S Mode, you have to change it in the settings, but then you have to use a registration key for Windows 10 Home or Pro. So I shelled out another $130 just to get a fully functioning OS. Factor that price into this laptop price. THEN- after purchasing Windows 10 Home, I had to keep trying over the course of 4 days for the laptop to accept me switching out of S Mode because Microsoft was conveniently having server errors on their side and so my request could not be processed at this time. This is a common issue, at least from what I read among those discussing S Mode on Reddit forums. Multiple people report that Microsoft has server issues when you try to opt out of S Mode.Very very unhappy with this laptop for the sole reason that the OS is Windows 10 in S Mode. It was inconvenient and one of the most useless things I have ever seen pre-installed on a computer. Created a major and unnecessary headache for me."
20,"I was hesitant getting a Chromebook as I was concerned I'd miss being able to install windows programs, but so far I am really impressed with this. It was very quick to setup and easy to sync all of my Google account info. Having the ability to install Google apps is great. It's lightweight, runs fast, and seems to have a long lasting battery.As far as shipping it came packaged really well and the condition is 9/10 with only a slight smudge on the top of lid."
21,Did not come with a charger
22,5 months is all this piece of crap lasted! Conveniently past the 90 warranty window.  I called the 3rd party seller and had a mini argument about their company standing behind their products...  He told he that I would have to take this into a repair shop to have a new microphone and camera installed.  I told him that I knew that this would cost more than the laptop itself.  It said it would be around $40.  Well guess what the report shop said.  Exactly what I knew from the beninging...it would cost $300 plus the laptop would never function the same.  DO NOT BUY!!  Save yourself the waste of money....  buy new and not from a 3rd party seller
23,I have no cell phone to get instruction s - this is not a laptop  - the keys are different and I have no idea how to use this -  I can barely hear it -  it takes forever just to load facebook -  it constantly buffers -  I see why it was discounted  -  junk.
24,I have another chromebook but it has an 11 inch screen.  I was surprised that this one with a 14inch screen has better battery life.  Mostly I am browsing internet so I don't need all of the slowness and problems associated with Windows 10.
25,"Exactly as described. Havent tried the touch screen yet because I keep forgetting it's an option. The chromebook is definitely different then I'm used to, but it has been an easy transition."
26,"I need Bluetooth for some things.  This unit will not run Bluetooth without completely taking away all my bandwidth for wifi.  I get 12M down but fire up Bluetooth and I drop to 1m or less.  So tube videos are  impossible to watch.  Even listening to just music via BT although not as drastic will still cause the audio to stutter/stop and start.The next thing is the wifi range is not as good as all my devices...  50 ft and the transfer rate down is a 1/3rd down...  <>8M....  All my devices run above 11M...  So sadly I am returning the unit.The BT issue has been known about for quite a while.  I would not have thought there would be any problem with BT...My Mac, PC win 10 laptop runs BT just fine an there is absolutely no bandwidth traffic!I borrowed a friends older Lenovo chromebook and it demonstrates the same thing.  His wifi speed was good.Jim"
27,"So the laptop is very portable,  easy to use, and pretty fast. The problem is I bought this as a Christmas gift, so didn't open or test it when I got it. After opening it we found that the webcam doesn't work. We tried ever solution we could find online but nothing worked. I tried to contact the seller and they we next to useless just telling me to refresh it, then never replying again. So I ended up having to but another laptop for zoom meetings for school. If you can I'd at the very least avoid this seller."
28,14 inch is a great size if you want something medium size. Very light weight and easy to use. Usbc cord is great so all of the devices that I own use the same charger. I got this for under 200 and it was well worth it if you need something to type and simple web browsing. My only wish was that this was touch screen and I didn't realized I needed touch screen at the time...
29,DO NOT ORDER THIS!!! I ordered something this and got a lower grade of Chrome book(N22 which is worth less than half the price of the laptop in the display).
30,"I've only had it about a week, and it has been constant troubleshooting.  When it works, I like the keyboard, the display is crisp and it boots up fast and switches tasks quickly.  But things didn't (and some still don't) work out of the box, and there is too much spamware installed.The right click on the touchpad did not function out of the box.  I researched a bit, couldn't find a good solution, but after I did a BIOS update for a different problem it seems to work now, although with a fiddly two finger gesture instead of just one finger clicking in the bottom right like every other laptop I've got.  It is a dice roll whether it registers both fingers or not, so you might get the right click menu, you might just open links or jump to somewhere else in the program and then have to get back and try again.  I'm guessing I'd get used to this.You do get Windows pre-installed.  The license key is a bit hard to find in case you need/want to reinstall it, but you can find it in the BIOS.  It boots real fast, so it is tricky to get to the BIOS menu.  Windows also doesn't seem to actually shut down, so when you open up the lid, it is already past the BIOS prompt (with the default settings).  Microsoft requires a Microsoft account to even use the computer, which isn't Lenovo's fault, but annoying.  Lenovo comes with ""helpful"" admin tools to update firmware and the BIOS, but you have to set up a Lenovo account to do so.  That is a pain, and I exited out, only to see that I've got an email verifying my Lenovo account, apparently populating it with info from the Microsoft account that I just set up.  I don't want to be paranoid, but Microsoft had me set up an account and five minutes later my information is being used to set up other accounts.  Not a good look for either side - how am I supposed to trust anything I do on this laptop?But even worse is the Lenovo software is like continuously being asked about your car's extended warranty, warning you about all the bad things that will happen and upselling you on better support.  How many people are buying a $500 laptop and needing on-site replacement services?The biggest problem by far is that I still don't know what the USB-C port does.  I initially set it up using my docking station.  USB-C charging didn't work.  It didn't recognize a second display.  It did recognize the ethernet connection and mouse and keyboard.  Reading up, it looks like it is fiddly with exactly which docking stations it will talk to.  I'm currently leaving one job, starting another, and for . . . reasons . . . , I currently have 5 daily use laptops, all of which work flawlessly with a ""high end"" Dell docking station.  I also have a ton of cheap ones from the last year hooking up school Chromebooks to various monitors.  None of them work with this Lenovo.  It will recognize the second display if I plug in the HDMI cable directly.  I have also tried any number of adapters to plug into the USB-C port - from Chromebooks, from a MacBookPro, from a dedicated USB charging hub that far exceeds the power requirements - no luck.  It doesn't recognize any of them to charge.  It does have a second charging port with a dedicated, proprietary connector which works well enough, but the brick that plugs to the wall is large and the cord is short-ish and the charging port is on one side of the machine only, which limits where I can actually use it.Speaking of which, the battery is nowhere near the 8.5 hours advertised.  More like 4, with the settings out of the box.  That is enough for me, but I had 75% charge left, suspended the computer and closed the lid, and it was completely empty 6 hours later.  I'm not sure you could be doing anything less with the computer, and it still drained the battery pretty quickly.  I've played with disabling some BIOS settings but don't see a huge difference.  If I don't have it plugged in overnight, it is dead in the morning.Other than that, no problems :)  I actually like the computer when it is running, it is much better than the one I am replacing, performance-wise.  But things did not work out of the box, and having a half-baked USB-C port that doesn't charge is probably a deal breaker for me.  I'm waiting on another docking station that has been reported to work well with this laptop before throwing away the days of configuration and returning it.  Who knows, maybe I just got a bum USB port and it does work out of the box for everyone else."
31,"This is my second Lenovo and I wouldn't have bought another one if the first wasn't a gem. The touchscreen can be very handy if you aren't a touchpad user (which I'm not) and you don't have space to use a mouse (such as on a plane). The only drawback on this particular model is no backlit keyboard.  Otherwise,  I give it 5 stars."
32,"I'm delighted with my new computer.... The only issue is that the fingerprint sensor isn't working, but everything is cool and despite the computer is made from plastic, it feels very classy."
33,very good home type computer
34,"WiFi died and even a complete software reset would not fix it, clearly a hardware issue. I am having to not only pay this seller to return it they are going to charge me a 20% restocking fee because I threw the box away THE DAY BEFORE IT DIED!"
35,"According to the Yale School of Management, Lenovo continues to pursue business interests in the Russian Federation even though scores of other reputable companies have withdrawn from the country."
36,"I bought this laptop for scientific computing, and I was waiting for one with an 8-core processor for parallelized computations. When I saw a Ryzen 8-core processor, 32 GB RAM, and the price, ~$900 before tax, it ticked. This HP-Ryzen laptop exceeded my expectations in speed and energy efficiency. I ran a benchmark test of Wolfram Mathematica (the software I use for computations) and the results were far above all other computers listed there for comparison. At the same time, the laptop does not consume much energy, its power adapted is small. I run a parallelized computation using all 8 cores for hours and the laptop's body is only a little bit warm. I do not hear any sound of the fan. This is a huge step forward in comparison to my previous laptops with Intel i7 processors that consumed a lot of energy and were getting hot even in the idling regime.On the other hand, it is apparently not a gaming laptop as it has an AMD Radeon graphics card, no expensive Nvidia that I don't need. Comparable gaming laptops (8 cores) on Amazon cost twice as much.I haven't found any serious drawbacks yet. A small drawback is that the keyboard is not illuminated from within, the body of this laptop and its keys are gray, while inscriptions on the keys are not white but grayish. With low light, you don't see them well, and you cannot work at night without a light. The keyboard is much better visible on my preceding Dell Inspiron laptop (Intel i5, also energy efficient and overall good) that has a black surface and keys, white key inscriptions, and keyboard illumination."
37,"great update from my 10 yr old lenovo t430.it is light and super fast, sturdy built and i like the touch.setup was easy and upgraded to win 11 in no time. fabulous interface. like the new windows!very happy with the purcahse."
38,Overall performance of the laptop is good. I primarily bought it for educational purposes and it definitely meets my needs.
39,It never worked as it should it seemed to be reconditioned
40,"I use the laptop for PowerPoints, projection, Xcel, etc.  Utilize it on a network and it hooked right up and worked great.  Not a single complaint.  Love it!"
41,My people say it works great!
42,"Mic doesn't pick up well when speaker is off or at edge of camera, but it is faster than the Ryzen 5 I murdered, lighter weight, too. I thought I would miss my 17in screen, but 15in is okay since the resolution is good."
43,"This is a long review.  To summarize, you get what you pay for and then some.  This is a very usable package at a bargain price.  Nothing is top-of-the-line, but you will get a nice, compact machine for web-based activity.This is my first Chromebook.  Previously I have used Macs and laptops from Toshiba and Lenovo.  I decided to go with a Chromebook because I mostly email, browse pages, Zoom, and watch Youtube.  Anything I need to do document-wise can be covered by Google.  The compactness and long battery life is a big plus.  I'm tired of big, heavy laptops wearing holes in my bags.This Chromebook weighs 2-1/4 .lbs, which is excellent.  It is about the size of a magazine, so I would not hestitate to take it anywhere.  The body is plastic, which is durable and easy to keep clean.  It's not as nice as metal, but it is generally solid.  The bottom panel is a teeny bit loose, but that is a nitpick.Battery life is as advertised.  Depending what you do you get around 10 hours or more, which is more than double any laptop I have used.The screen opens to 135 degrees (or 45 degrees against the tabletop).  I was disappointed it did not open to a full 180, but I can work with it.  Screen brightness is listed at 220 nits (on the low end), but don't let that deter you; it is as bright as my 8 year old Macbook and my Lenovo laptop assigned by work. For indoor use, it works just fine.  If you work outside, you will have to find shade.  The display quality is not the best, but perfectly useable.  It is an IPS display, which provides better viewing angles and color rendition.  The 11.6"" screen is enough real estate for watching videos and reading the news.  I can type this review and read my email side by side.  This is also a touch screen, which seems to work fine in my limited experience.  When laying down with the Chromebook on my chest, it's nice to just browse using the touchscreen.  I have downloaded a few Android games, and they work great on the touchscreen.  IMO spend more for the touch screen if you want to use Android apps.The keyboard is a comfortable size.  I am typing efficiently without making lots of mistakes.  Most of the keys are where you expect them to be.  The specialized Chrome keys don't interfere.  The keys themselves have a nice, positive response.  Equally responsive is the trackpad, which comes with a full repertoire of gestures for scrolling, zooming, and viewing apps.  One thing I noticed is you can only physically click on the botton half of the touchpad, but I usually tap to click.The on-board speakers are a nice surprise.  They are loud and clear.  An audiophile might find them slightly tinny, but I can listen to music for hours using just these speakers.  There is minimal distortion when I crank the volume up to max. Of course, there is a headphone jack and bluetooth capability.32 gigs of memory may be challenged if you install a lot of apps.  The Chrome System takes up about 13 GB on its own. I have inserted a 128 GB Micro SD card, which can be used as storage for Android apps that support it.  For example, I can download music from Youtube Music to my SD card.  Documents from the Text editor and Camera app can be directed to the SD card as well.Regarding the processor, I don't do anything that has taxed this system yet.  I usually only have a couple of tabs and apps open, and I play a few games.  Keep in mind this is the same processor on the almost universally lauded Lenovo Duet Chromebook, so it is no slouch.The 720p webcam is adquate for web conferencing, taking snapshots or recording videos.  It's a little grainy with indoor lighting.  People seem to hear me fine using the internal microphone, but works best if you are sitting right in front of the computer.  The mic input can be adjusted if you expand the volume options in the wifi/battery/time options.One last cool thing is you can charge this Chromebook with a phone charger (with the right cable).  It is slow, and must be done while the Chromebook is not in use.  I was able to get 15% per hour using a basic phone charger.  It might be nice if you are traveling and don't need to lug around the clunky power supply that comes with this Chromebook.Overall, I am happy with my purchase. This is a nice value package that delivers."
44,"I first want to say that mechanically this laptop worked great. The company that sent it also sent it very fast, arriving ahead of the projected date. Now that positivity is out of the way, why am i returning it?Say what you want about me, but i didn't realize that this device used a different OS. I originally wanted an affordable laptop for some word processing. Chrome OS does not allow you to do this. Functionally it could,  but it designed to be an internet browser and little else. Do you have a phone? Well, your phone is capable of everything this device can do and more. Why would anyone need a laptop with less functionality than a phone?Many software programs support a variety of operating systems. They do not currently work with Chrome OS. You cannot even attempt to download them. I have heard that you can download apps (not that i was able to experience this for myself), but that will be the only downloading of programs that you might have access to.This now leads to my final gripe, the device is basically online only.A browser cannot function without internet, so it is with this device. It seems to be so dependent on this that it actually bugged out when i tried to delete the only wifi connection it had. (which reminds me, there is no way that you can factory reset this device. There is no option to do so, take that as you will.) When you first start up this device, it will force you to connect to the internet. You can skip putting in you Google account info, but it will not allow you to proceed without internet.Tldr: Don't get anything with Chrome OS. Your phone is capable of so much more than this ever will be."
45,"This is a great Chromebook for a middle to highschooler. It has a real long battery life charges quickly, and maintains a strong wireless signal. The touchscreen is very responsive and we haven’t had any problems with it at all. It has a very comfortable keyboard."
46,"I only use a computer for personal stuff, e-mails, facebook, random stuff., a zoom meeting once a week. I'm 72 and needed a lighter, smaller one than my dinosaur of a laptop. This fits the bill perfectly. It weighs less than the average book, it has a very long battery life, its size and weight makes it easily portable, and I can have it outside on the deck for hours without losing power. I love the touchscreen, and it was not hard converting to the Chrome OS from Windows. The only thing this didn't offer was a backlit keyboard, but since It's white, w/white keyboard, It's not hard to see even in dim light. So easy to use and carry, and easily contains everything my old computer had downloaded--and that's a lot!  I Love It!"
47,"It's very important to note, this is a Chromebook NOT a full-sized laptop, so this may be much smaller than expected.Personally, I love this Chromebook, size and all. It works great and has a pretty decent quality. No issues with so far with charging, battery life, crashing, etc. I would only hope for a better sound quality, as it doesn't get very loud at all. Plenty of storage space for me as well, as I use it for crafting (Design Space app, emails, saving photos, etc.) I would also recommend this for those looking for something small with a keyboard for school use."
48,"This is perfect for what I need. I  am a writer and have been writing on a kindle tablet, and it was just too small."
49,"I like the Chromebook, but it restarts itself every day on its own. I've had it for less than a month. I believe the MicroSD card slot is too close to the power cord slot. I leverage my thumb on the side of the Chromebook to pull the power cord out (the spot where the MicroSD card slot is) so I end up uninstalling the card. No, there's no other way to carefully remove the power cord. I've had several Chromebooks and never had issues until this one."
50,"I didn't realize how small it was however it's a nice laptop,the screen did go black for a full day, it was charged an everything,for some weird reason it came back on, that's the only issue I've had with it"
51,"Make sure you read the fine print. I received my chromebook. The package it was in was already opened. A little annoyed I paid for a new one and got a used one but it looked ok. Plug it in to start using it and check it out. Kept saying it was charging. Unplugged it the next day only for it to cut righty back off and say it was dead. I tried another chromebook charger and the same thing happened. So I decided to get some support. Amazon was nice but made me try all the things I already did. After nothing worked, again. They told me to contact the seller, there was nothing else they could do to help me. I reached out to the seller and got no reply. And apparently I can’t return it. For any reason whatsoever. So now I have a cr*p laptop that I just wasted $ on that I guess I’ll now have to pay to take somewhere to fix it. So annoyed and disappointed. I haven’t even had it a few days and can’t even return for a replacement or to get my money back. Cool cool cool. Thanks"
52,"If my labtop goes to sleep, when I try to use it from sleep the screen is split.  The botton half is on top and the top part is on the bottom.  And nothing can be done to fix this other than logging out and shutting down and restarting the computer. This becomes very annoying after a while.  Also, with regularity, the notebook simply freezes and again, the only remedy is to shut down and restart. A third regret is that it is very, very slow, much slower than the 5-year old Acer Chromebook (similar price) that I am trying to replace because it's nearing 5-years old and Chrome no longer supports my Acer Chromebook with security updates.  The HP Chromebook is such poor quality that I don't use it anymore, I'm back to using my 5-year old Acer Chromebook.  I have a few more months until it's no longer supported.  I think I will try the Pixelbook Go, it seems to have good reviews and I have much higher hopes for it.  I'm so disappointed with the HP that I will never, ever consider another HP product.  Such low, laughable quality."
53,I did not know that the Chromebook I purchased was ‘refurbished’ until I received it.  The price pd was for a new laptop. I feel cheated. I am not happy.
54,"Its a basic Chromebook.  Nothing fancy but does exactly what I need it to do.  Internet searching, emails and can stream  amazon video.  Going to experiment with Google Docs and slides also.  For the money...I think it was a great purchase."
55,"I was not sure I would like a Chromebook. Quick start up. Once you figure out how to work off line and navigate, it's not that different from other formats. You can easily add memory via a thumb drive or micro sd card. The only thing I can't do is a wireless connection to my printer.  Small inconvenience for the cost of the laptop. It is plenty fast for office apps and the internet with the battery lasting all day. Thumbs up."
56,"The  HP Chromebook is an excellent multi purpose laptop. It can be used for researching online, budgeting and finances, games, music and movies. Shopping for anything needed for the entire family.Taking classes on line or for homework for students."
57,"It looks new and is fast, has a long battery life, and is spot on what we needed.  Just a fast device that we can search the web on and project onto a television screen.  Lightweight so we can move it around easily and small so it tucks away when not in use.  Can't beat the price for this level of computer."
58,"The laptop was purchased renewed. Be careful who you purchase from. Mine was severely compromised and infected all of my androids. I suggest to thoroughly inspect it first and if something seems out of the norm, return item immediately. Such as logging in and out. Be safe and spend a few xtra dollars on a new one if you can. I wish I would of. Just a warning. I'm sure not all of the sellers are untrustworthy but the few that are? Beware."
59,We bought this product for my father in law as a gift.  He's a novice to say the least at technology and couldn't be more pleased with the product.  Company did a great job and it arrived two days after the purchase in a secure box and packaged to ensure no damage would take place.  I would definitely order from them again!
60,The laptop I received is not what I expected. This laptop does not want to turn on no matter what power adapter I use. The problem is with the computer itself. It's very inconvenient and incredibly disappointing.
61,was delivered with a user id still on it.  renewed?  No one even looked at it.  Total BS
62,This computer does NOT have a backlit keyboard as advertised in the product description.
63,"My only gripe is the screen itself. Has a backlight sheen, so you have the have the right angle to see colors correctly. Had to download a second party program to change gamma and brightness, but it looks better now.Has SD slot, and my first Windows 11 computer. Everything installs and works properly. A backlit keyboard would be nice, but I knew it didn’t have one when I bought it."
64,"I just got this computer today and my first impression is: it's loud. The keys are not clicky but sort of hollow sounding, which isn't too bad. The fans turn on and off constantly and WEEEESHHHHHHHH for minutes at a time (all I've done so far is load Chrome). The worst thing for me is the touchpad makes a sound like you're dragging your finger over bad paper from grade-school chapter books. I'm autistic (and admittedly have a headache right now ((there go the fans for no reason))) and I'm extremely sensitive to noises and this fffsffssffsfsfsfsfssssssss sound is super irritating. My old HP had a nice smooth touchpad that literally made NO NOISE, why oh why would they change it? I'm already trying to duck the noise my own fingers are making, or using my other hand to cover it up to deaden the noise. I'll end up using this with headphones in a lot, which will make my husband sad...Still sitting here with the fans going, and they actually cover up the noise of the touchpad... That's not a solution.I'm sure I'll be back with more to say but this was my immediate unhappy impressionnext day update: WHY DIDN'T ANYONE MENTION THAT ####### ### ###### ######## ###### LIGHT ON THE F6 KEY ????? It comes on when you push mute,,,,which, I ALWAYS have my computer on mute. I realise I could just turn down the volume but I want to push the mute button. And now when I do, this annoying orange light comes on that's a tiny sun in a dark room, very distracting. I hate it and now have put .99 cent nail polish on my 750$ machine.FEW DAYS LATER: the nail polish is holding up, but using this thing with only WoW running on it (that's it, that's all that on it) it's like being on the moores on a windy night. Just WEeeEEEEEEEeSHHHSEeWWEEEEEEEEESssshEEEEEEEWEEEEEEEHHHHHWWSSSSSS constantly from the processors, it's high pitched and incessant.The arrow keys are weird shaped and too small (for laptop gaming purposes) but at least the entire spacebar and touchpad work which is more than I could say for the Dell I had."
65,"I was skeptical when I ordered this because there was not a model included in the description. But I have never had an issue returning anything I have ordered through Amazon in the past so I decided to go for it.Yes, it is an HP laptop! It is actually an hp laptop model 15-ef2127wm . I ordered the one with 32GB RAM and 1 TB SSD drive. I wanted something with similar specs to my desktop pc. I have been extremely pleased with the performance!I tried to take a picture since the product information is on the bottom of the laptop. However, the font is extremely small and the black on gray isn't the best contrast so the image tends to be blurry. If I could change one thing about it I would have the keyboard backlit. I like that the cooling vent is on the top between the screen and the keyboard. I tend to play City of Heroes Homecoming for hours on end. I changed my graphics settings for the appearance over performance and this laptop never seemed to get hot even after 8 hours of gaming!I am not into VR gaming so you might check with HP on that. it will upgrade to Windows 11. I personally have not done this because my desktop pcs are not compatible and I like to have everything on the same operating system."
66,"I've been looking for a new laptop.  This is the third one I've bought, and I'll probably end up keeping it against my better judgement just because I'm tired of looking.  My main issue is that the product listing says this is a new 2022 model.  And it comes with UDB-C data only.  None of my docking stations work with it at all.  It doesn't send video.  No charging.  It doesn't recognize etherrnet.  It doesn't recognize a mouse or keyboard or anything besides a USB storage device.  Yes, you can use the HDMI port on the laptop and that works fine.  And it has two USB A ports for a keyboard and mouse and you can hope you don't need anything else.  And you can pray you don't lose or damage the charger, because it is of course non-standard.  I move between my desk and other areas enough that plugging and unplugging all of the peripherals multiple times a day is not a good thing.This isn't the highest end laptop, but for the price missing this functionality makes no sense.  My $150 chromebooks have had this for years, as have all of my work laptops from a variety of manufacturers.You might ask why I'm on my third laptop and why I still keep making this error?  The product copy of this on Amazon doesn't mention it either way.  But, I had other questions, and found the model on other websites and the HP website, and those indicated a docking station was supported.  The previous one I returned to Amazon because it specifically said it had support and didn't.  The first one I returned somewhere else, because I saw USB-C and charging/monitors have been supported for so long, I just assumed this would work, plus one of the pictures talked about USB-C and had a picture of multiple monitors but had photoshopped all the wires out and they said after the picture was showing using the HDMI port on the laptop.This is also the reason I'm keeping it.  I look around at other similarly priced or slightly higher ones, and it is really difficult to tell if returning yet another one will make a difference - I guess I'll have to go see them in person to tell for sure.  Now, if I wanted a Chromebook, I know I could get one at 1/3 the price that supports this, but I really need a functional SSH client and X-Windows display.All of that said, the laptop is functional enough.  Fast to boot, quick to compile code, fast switching between programs, good display, above average battery life.  If only they'd tossed in a $5 part to have a real port."
67,"Nice computer, fast, good screen, but just stopped working after 3+ weeks of light use. You can turn it off, but the hard-drive continues running in the background and you cannot turn it on again for days! Fully charged, maybe you are in luck to turn it on -but- on most days you are OUT OF LUCK! Will return for credit! Used the Amazon Return policy within the allotted time period, printed the return label and returned item with extra packaging ($21) to the seller via UPS. Item was returned to seller on 2/6/2022 confirmed by UPS tracking and I am still waiting for a full refund by seller / Amazon."
68,"I wanted 16 GB of RAM and SSD hard drive but didn't need a ton of space.  Some of the complaints I have read are valid.  The USB-C port does not support video.  Hard to find anywhere in the description but if that's a deal breaker for you look for USB-C Thunderbolt.  There is an actual Thunderbolt beside the USB-C port.  I almost returned the unit because of the keyboard.  Although I didn't care if it was back lit (it's not), the contrast between the letters and key is not good.  I could not see the symbols in low light.  I bought a silicon keyboard cover for about 8 bucks from the Big A and now can easily see and I am more protected from spills.  For casual users this is a great unit.  It's light and I like the screen size and the 10 digit pad built in.  You want 3 screens and a ton of ports, better dig deeper into your wallet."
69,"This laptop was not advertised as having a touchscreen and does not have one, and is the reason for not rating a touchscreen.This laptop was for my grandson to have for school work and the on-line games he likes to participate in. He loves it and from what I have seen the laptop is very responsive and will work for him through school. Additional software is needed for word processing, etc. The only thing I did not like is, when opening and turning on the laptop it immediately goes into a setup and is a not pre-installed with Windows 11 OS, with only your personal preferences and connectivity to setup. I will update this review if to the contrary in a couple of months from now. So far, I do not expect to have to do an update."
70,"Well it worked for about 3 days before it had fatal OS issues, I have been in contact with HP since then and have ran the hardware tests a half dozen time and had to install windows 10 in order to get back to having an OS, but now the laptop cannot find a network... ""update"" returned laptop after wasting days trying to get it fixed, but hey there's a 72$ restocking fee for a garbage laptop so that's always nice."
71,It is bowed in the middle and twangs when I type.  Computer is fast and screen is good.  Is this a genuine HP laptop?
72,"I love everything about this HP laptop the quality, the screen, and battery life; everything is excellent! A good investment for doing university classes. Also, suitable for work/professional purposes as well."
73,"With only minor signs of use and a first boot fatal error that required a rescue usb, after around 2 weeks of use I must say that this is the right minimum specs for a daily office work without issues. 64gb allows to install some linux apps to work, battery arrived with 96% of health in diagnosis. I don't think you can't get better specs these days for the price. Recommended"
74,"Received in perfect condition, no sign of prior use. Chrome OS loaded normally and was updated to latest edition without issues. International delivery was surprisingly fast."
75,The battery life wasn't good and came with a scratch on top.
76,"Very well built and with an elegant design. Good processor, very fast. Quiet fan operation, cool keeping in palm rest area.I was surprised by the fact that it came with an ""HDD Kit"" (connectors), to expand the storage capacity with an internal HDD disk (I asked Asus and they replied that a HDD or SSD of up to 1 TB can be installed, to expand the capacity storage).Asus customer service is very good (it comes with MyAsus software that makes communication very easy); is one reason I bought this brand. Two years ago I bought an Asus 13 ""Notebook, I had a software problem with the keyboard lighting and in a few messages they guided me on how to solve it, until now I have never had problems again.I sincerely recommend this Notebook."
77,"Light weight, great start up speed with SSD drive.  Keyboard backlighting good for dim lights but key letters hard to see in medium light.  Ability to turn off keyboard backlighting is a plus and actually makes letters easier to see in bright light."
78,"I've been using my new ASUS VivoBook computer for over a week and have a few comments.  First, it's a great computer for those folks who like to work in the dark.  The contrast between the silver keys and the lighted characters is poor at best.  Key F7 allows four settings for the brightness of the characters, but the brightest one is still too dim. I find it easy to see the keyboard if I work in a dimmed setting.  I've owned two ASUS computers previously and both have had excellent keyboard contrast. Why did they change to a poor contrast keyboard? Without this fault I would give it a 5 star rating.This is sold as a portable computer.  At five pounds it might be better described as transportable.This computer does NOT have a touch screen as is advertised by Amazon. This is a good screen if you don't like looking at finger prints.Going to ASUS for help sends you to a ""paid-for"" tech group. This is a helluva way to provide support and ASUS should be ashamed!"
79,"Great laptop; very fast processor (i7), good RAM memory and nice solid state drive; there is no Touch Screen so don't know why Amazon wanted a rating on it; there are 2 issues:  support is only by email (almost useless for computers) and although it says it will support 2 monitors, it will ONLY if you close the laptop's lid; video card only supports a ""TOTAL"" of 2 monitors so don't plan on using the laptop's screen if you intend to use 2 external monitors - lid must be closed for it to display on both external monitors"
80,"Bought for my husband after his other asus only lasted 18mths. I was skeptical to say the least, but this was what he wanted. Aside from the volume being horrible, it appears to be working just fine. We’re only 2mths into it so I’m still very cautious."
81,"In the market for a new laptop?  I've found this unit to be exceptional, compared to my older Dell Latitude.  Speed, and the 17-inch screen feels good on my aging eyes."
82,Very happy so far--only drawback is that the speakers on this laptop don't get very loud....
83,"This laptop is a solid, well-built device with speed, great display, and a good keyboard.  The only downside I see is the audio quality.  Not as good as I had hoped."
84,
85,"Very nice laptop the screen is the right size, the only downside I have is the keys can be hard to see at times"
86,"This one has a super fast boot up time. The only issue I have so far is that the Capslock button had a light that worked when you clicked on it (so you know when it's enabled) but now it does not light up. The computer it self is pretty good. After doing so extensive research, this one was the ""worth it"" laptop that I needed. Good for school work and office work. Comes in ""windows S mode"" but its easy to switch out to a regular mode. All you need to do is install Chrome and google will tell you exactly what you need to do to switch out of the ""S"" mode. Screen quality isn't HD but you really won't notice the difference. I would have given a five star rating if it wasn't for the capslock issue. I wish they made this with a white color design.Update-  Some vibrations and crack in sound but still working good."
87,"Very disappointed, this was advertised as touch screen then on the description it says non touch screen and it’s much smaller than described. Very disappointed."
88,We mainly use this Computer for zoom meetings and work so it works perfectly for emails and things like that nothing special for us
89,"I bought this laptop because I really don't need anything fancy AT ALL! It was just supposed to be for my kids when they needed to do homework, and for me to use to search a few things on the internet and check my email.... THATS IT! It was RIDICULOUS! I seriously timed it just to prove my point, and from the time I turned it on to the time it was ready to actually use it took 15 MINUTES!! Now I am not one of these young kids who think if things don't happen in a blink of an eye, it is slow and I get mad. I grew up with dial up and so I am used to sitting and waiting on a computer. But this was worse than that. It would never fully load, when I typed on it, it wouldn't keep up, and it was always just turning off. Then to turn it back on, well that was quite the process that sometimes wouldn't happen that day. I am not techy in the least, I just want a computer to turn on, let me search a few things, and let my kids search a few things. I didn't think I asked that much. This computer didn't agree with me. So if you have the patience of JOB, this laptop just may be for you. If not, don't waste your time."
90,"This is my first Dell and I’ve called customer service twice for minor issues and they really go the extra mile, I’ve never experienced such great customer service before. Before purchasing my Dell laptop, I read about their renowned customer service and now I know it’s the real deal. My only complaint is the lackluster black generic case, miss having a shiny case; otherwise superb product."
91,"This laptop was a Christmas gift for my wife.  It powered up and the setup was done without issue.  We used it for a day, doing web-based apps and even watched some YouTube videos with no issues.  We used it again a couple of days later, but the performance was very poor.  Screens would hang and freeze for extending periods.  It was unusable.  We powered down and closed the device.  We were out of town and returned home a week later.  It powered up and was useable for a little while (an hour or two), then again became slow.  When typing a word, each letter would take several seconds to complete.  It was extremely frustrating and disappointing so we have returned it."
92,"Out of the box it was slow to start up and even slower to open any app. I spent days researching how to speed it up and still failed to get it to work. Issue others have with this model is for some reason, even with 16GB or more of Ram, it still has high CPU and high Disk use ongoing. Even when not doing anything. Activity monitor show this clearly. Worst part was I could not fix after a week(am pretty PC knowledgable), I contacted Dell and they finally concluded it must be a software issue and not hardware so I would have to pay them $99 to have tech help fix.Very let down since my first PC ever was a Dell XPS series that was awesome and lasted me 6 years.  It's a brand new PC and I have to pay to fix it. I thought he was joking. So I sent it back and ordered Macbook Pro."
93,"Computer was ordered with both SSD and HDD drives. The operating system was installed on the SSD while the HDD was unformatted and could not be seen by Windows 10. I am glad I was savvy enough to use utilities to see if the HDD was indeed installed, otherwise I would have had to return to the vendor and pay the return shipping fees (UPS would have been $34). If I had sent this to my wife or other family members, they sure would have returned the computer for not having the purchased second drive (HDD)."
94,"My new job as a department head for a city means I need to work almost anywhere on any given day - my office, a conference room, a public event, out in the Industrial Park or out of town. I have used this laptop for 60 days now in my car, my office, at the fire department, out in the desert at a solar farm and in three different cities. It just works everywhere and every time I need it. It connects instantly to my office wifi and my portable cellular signal hotspot every single time.The touchscreen is responsive and easy to use in tablet form or as a regular laptop. The ability to convert to a tablet has been immensely useful on the go for me - I bought the companion pen/stylus separately to add property line markers and such on satellite photos out in the field. I fold the computer and go into tablet mode seamlessly as needed. The overall processing speed is more than enough and I haven't experienced any lag at all even with multiple files, programs and functions going at once. It runs Microsoft Office and additional photo editing software and other stuff without any drama.I drag this laptop around in a padded case in a tote bag with various files I need for the day and it's light enough that I don't feel like I'm carrying an extra 10lbs of nonsense after a 10 hour day. My only real complaint is that the fingerprint reader is not always easy to use or fully functional. I have actually just quit messing with it entirely and instead use a 6 digit pin number to unlock the computer. It's been a dream for Zoom connections both in my office and on the go with the wifi hotpot only. I'm very glad I chose this laptop instead of the Surface or something different."
95,This laptop was the best deal of Christmas 2020!! It's an amazing price for everything that comes with it! My 13 yo son uses it primarily for gaming and has only good things to say. Buy this!! You won't be disappointed!
96,"The last laptop I bought - a Lenovo - had an optical drive. So nearly a decade old. But it was a total workhorse for work and home use. And needed replacement.After *lots* of reading and research I landed on the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro, in no small no part because my Samsung Galaxy 10+ phone has done so well.Also? This was in stock! Several others I looked at were either out when I started looking, or went to backorder while I was on the hunt. And the Amazon 5-payment plan was a little kinder on my budget.Screen is incredible. Backlit keyboard. RAM is nearly triple what my old machine had (16gb v 6), so using Photoshop now is no big deal while I'm using several other apps simultaneously. It sure used to be. And it takes about a second - yep - once you flip the screen open to wake.Downside? It's *very* thin and *very* light compared to my old machine, so that's taken some getting used to. I need to hold it in place while I open the screen. And right now it actually sits ON the old one when I'm working. But it's still new yet.Looks like it's a bit more expensive now ( I paid about $1100) but I think still a deal for what you'll be getting, esp if you haven't upgraded in a while as was my case.Highly recommend."
97,Super fast laptop.The screen is beautiful. I love the light weight.Nice packing.Best laptop I've ever won.The sould quality is amazing for this thin laptop. (You will have to go to the sound setting and press the advance speaker quality to activate the best sound possible)
98,This it's totally defected. I'm sending it tomorrow through UPS back to Amazon due to the fact that it will not charge. Stops at 44% and doesn't go on and it should charge in 30 minutes from what the information States. I am totally disappointed. There was no adapter in it either.
99,"Llevo unas semanas con mi Samsung Galaxy Book Pro y estoy más que feliz con ella, porque es súper rápida, sensible y con una calidad de imagen en la pantalla super espectacular ¡Lo mejor de lo mejor! Y más siendo a ese precio."
100,I absolutely hated windows 11 it's garbage and cost me down time trying to navigate is bs os
101,"Having laptops provided by employer for several years, I hadn’t purchased in a while. Usually I think budget, but this time I splurged a bit and I am very happy.Super lightweight and very fast startup and waking. AMZN also providing good link for MS 365 Office"
102,The laptop came with a faulty boot system and I had to install the Windows 11 from scratch to get it work. The laptop was unable to repair itself. It's actually a used one from the Amazon warehouse buy at least they should have warned that it might be defective.
103,Great Sound! Easily the finest laptop audio you can ask for at this price. Screen flickering at lowering brightness and does not look sharp enough for Full HD resolution. AMOLED colors are great as usual. battery life is decent.
104,Super fast machine. Fantastic screen resolution and color rendition. Lots of memory for manipulating big data files. Can't find anything to complain about. Writing code to do financial analysis on large Account Receivable files. The speed is amazing.
105,"Great device, really like it. Lightweight, fast, quiet, long battery life. Best notebook I had ever!The only disadvantage found by now - camera quality is quite poor.Even my 5 years old macbook has better camera."
106,"Just like that title says ... Nice Upgrade from my old Alienware-18 Gaming Laptop but the sound ABSOLUTELY SUCKS!. I had to buy a set of external speakers to go with it. It sounded like someone stuffed a pillow into the speakers, it is very muffled and beyond far too (fake-sounding) bassy."
107,"I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!"
108,"This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop."
109,"A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as ""basic needs"" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to ""S Mode"" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?"
110,"A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend."
111,BUYER BE AWARE: This computer has Microsoft 10S. This is scam software by Microsoft to force you to use only Microsoft apps from their deserted island wasteland of an app store. The computer will not allow you to do anything else. You can upgrade to a full version of Microsoft 10... for another $134. Hard pass. STAY AWAY from ALL computers with Microsoft 10S!! Absolute garbage software.
112,"I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and ""safe."" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be."
113,It runs amazing
114,"*UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant ."
115,"The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5"" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5"" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an ""upgrade your edition of Windows"" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the ""Go to the Store"" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the ""helpful"" button! Thank you!"
116,"I bought this laptop for its weight and that's about the only thing positive I can say about it.The processing power is not very strong, so performance-wise, I was not impressed. But with the pricetag considered, I'm all right with this.However, the biggest thing for me is the OS- WINDOWS 10-IN S MODE.I had never heard of S Mode, and I didn't notice this when I bought the laptop.Apparently, S Mode is Microsoft's way of ensuring that you only use their apps and products by blocking you from downloading any outside apps. You have to get them all through their store. So, for example, were I to try to download Norton's anti-virus from Norton's official site, Microsoft's S Mode would tell me that I am unable. Any and all files outside of their store are blocked from being downloaded.In order to leave S Mode, you have to change it in the settings, but then you have to use a registration key for Windows 10 Home or Pro. So I shelled out another $130 just to get a fully functioning OS. Factor that price into this laptop price. THEN- after purchasing Windows 10 Home, I had to keep trying over the course of 4 days for the laptop to accept me switching out of S Mode because Microsoft was conveniently having server errors on their side and so my request could not be processed at this time. This is a common issue, at least from what I read among those discussing S Mode on Reddit forums. Multiple people report that Microsoft has server issues when you try to opt out of S Mode.Very very unhappy with this laptop for the sole reason that the OS is Windows 10 in S Mode. It was inconvenient and one of the most useless things I have ever seen pre-installed on a computer. Created a major and unnecessary headache for me."
117,"I was hesitant getting a Chromebook as I was concerned I'd miss being able to install windows programs, but so far I am really impressed with this. It was very quick to setup and easy to sync all of my Google account info. Having the ability to install Google apps is great. It's lightweight, runs fast, and seems to have a long lasting battery.As far as shipping it came packaged really well and the condition is 9/10 with only a slight smudge on the top of lid."
118,Did not come with a charger
119,5 months is all this piece of crap lasted! Conveniently past the 90 warranty window.  I called the 3rd party seller and had a mini argument about their company standing behind their products...  He told he that I would have to take this into a repair shop to have a new microphone and camera installed.  I told him that I knew that this would cost more than the laptop itself.  It said it would be around $40.  Well guess what the report shop said.  Exactly what I knew from the beninging...it would cost $300 plus the laptop would never function the same.  DO NOT BUY!!  Save yourself the waste of money....  buy new and not from a 3rd party seller
120,I have no cell phone to get instruction s - this is not a laptop  - the keys are different and I have no idea how to use this -  I can barely hear it -  it takes forever just to load facebook -  it constantly buffers -  I see why it was discounted  -  junk.
121,I have another chromebook but it has an 11 inch screen.  I was surprised that this one with a 14inch screen has better battery life.  Mostly I am browsing internet so I don't need all of the slowness and problems associated with Windows 10.
122,"Exactly as described. Havent tried the touch screen yet because I keep forgetting it's an option. The chromebook is definitely different then I'm used to, but it has been an easy transition."
123,"I need Bluetooth for some things.  This unit will not run Bluetooth without completely taking away all my bandwidth for wifi.  I get 12M down but fire up Bluetooth and I drop to 1m or less.  So tube videos are  impossible to watch.  Even listening to just music via BT although not as drastic will still cause the audio to stutter/stop and start.The next thing is the wifi range is not as good as all my devices...  50 ft and the transfer rate down is a 1/3rd down...  <>8M....  All my devices run above 11M...  So sadly I am returning the unit.The BT issue has been known about for quite a while.  I would not have thought there would be any problem with BT...My Mac, PC win 10 laptop runs BT just fine an there is absolutely no bandwidth traffic!I borrowed a friends older Lenovo chromebook and it demonstrates the same thing.  His wifi speed was good.Jim"
124,"So the laptop is very portable,  easy to use, and pretty fast. The problem is I bought this as a Christmas gift, so didn't open or test it when I got it. After opening it we found that the webcam doesn't work. We tried ever solution we could find online but nothing worked. I tried to contact the seller and they we next to useless just telling me to refresh it, then never replying again. So I ended up having to but another laptop for zoom meetings for school. If you can I'd at the very least avoid this seller."
125,14 inch is a great size if you want something medium size. Very light weight and easy to use. Usbc cord is great so all of the devices that I own use the same charger. I got this for under 200 and it was well worth it if you need something to type and simple web browsing. My only wish was that this was touch screen and I didn't realized I needed touch screen at the time...
126,DO NOT ORDER THIS!!! I ordered something this and got a lower grade of Chrome book(N22 which is worth less than half the price of the laptop in the display).
127,I did not know that the Chromebook I purchased was ‘refurbished’ until I received it.  The price pd was for a new laptop. I feel cheated. I am not happy.
128,"Its a basic Chromebook.  Nothing fancy but does exactly what I need it to do.  Internet searching, emails and can stream  amazon video.  Going to experiment with Google Docs and slides also.  For the money...I think it was a great purchase."
129,"I was not sure I would like a Chromebook. Quick start up. Once you figure out how to work off line and navigate, it's not that different from other formats. You can easily add memory via a thumb drive or micro sd card. The only thing I can't do is a wireless connection to my printer.  Small inconvenience for the cost of the laptop. It is plenty fast for office apps and the internet with the battery lasting all day. Thumbs up."
130,"The  HP Chromebook is an excellent multi purpose laptop. It can be used for researching online, budgeting and finances, games, music and movies. Shopping for anything needed for the entire family.Taking classes on line or for homework for students."
131,"It looks new and is fast, has a long battery life, and is spot on what we needed.  Just a fast device that we can search the web on and project onto a television screen.  Lightweight so we can move it around easily and small so it tucks away when not in use.  Can't beat the price for this level of computer."
132,"The laptop was purchased renewed. Be careful who you purchase from. Mine was severely compromised and infected all of my androids. I suggest to thoroughly inspect it first and if something seems out of the norm, return item immediately. Such as logging in and out. Be safe and spend a few xtra dollars on a new one if you can. I wish I would of. Just a warning. I'm sure not all of the sellers are untrustworthy but the few that are? Beware."
133,We bought this product for my father in law as a gift.  He's a novice to say the least at technology and couldn't be more pleased with the product.  Company did a great job and it arrived two days after the purchase in a secure box and packaged to ensure no damage would take place.  I would definitely order from them again!
134,The laptop I received is not what I expected. This laptop does not want to turn on no matter what power adapter I use. The problem is with the computer itself. It's very inconvenient and incredibly disappointing.
135,was delivered with a user id still on it.  renewed?  No one even looked at it.  Total BS
136,This computer does NOT have a backlit keyboard as advertised in the product description.
137,"If you’re wondering if this laptop will run your favorite games at least at medium or low settings, YES. Don’t let the low price fool you, AMD has upped the laptop game with this processor. I’m running Fortnite with a steady 120fps on 1080p High settings. And this is only with the one 8gb stick of ram. If you add one more 8gb stick, which costs like $50 or so, you will increase the performance a LOT because this AMD processor relies on having both RAM slots occupied to run best. I’m only using the one 8gb stick and it’s running this well, so if you spend the extra $50 you’ll have a really good laptop for casual gaming at the same price as a PS4 right now. We’ve come a long way from before when all computers that you could even think about running any sort of game on costed atleast $700, and that’s for a desktop. I love it."
138,"this won't blow your mind if you're looking for a gaming laptop, but it's a very powerful AMD Ryzen laptop at a price point you'll only find with budget laptops rocking a Celeron or other wimpy CPU.physically very lightweight and very quiet (fans hardly ever kick in, and when they do, they're almost silent). it has a plastic body, but they make up for this by using a very attractive deep blue color, reminiscent of the old Silicon Graphics workstations and other 90s hardware I used as a kid. the keys are dark graphite with white backlit letters. one USB C port is the only downside I could see here (data only - no charging via this port)... though it does have a card reader and a fingerprint reader for the power button. the supplied charger is slim similar to the one you would find with a cell phone. comes with 4GB RAM soldered to the board plus a swappable 4GB (DDR4 3200MHz) which you can change out for 8GB to get 12GB total RAM. in terms of software, it comes with Windows 11 Home, which has the strange downside of requiring a Microsoft account to sign in and lacking the ability to join a domain and other more advanced networking features. minimal bloatware from Lenovo (all of which can be uninstalled, though you probably want to keep the Lenovo Utilities package to manage the hotkeys). comes with the ""free"" version of Office 360 as well as a 1yr version of McAfee Antivirus. this beats anything I saw at the big box stores in both specs and price; more than just a basic laptop. this matches or outperforms my Macbook Pro."
139,I know you get paid for allowing these security software companies to pre install their 3 month free software but please leave it off.  It took longer than anything else to uninstall and reinstall my chosen security suite. Include a key code for a “free” tryout instead
140,"I like it so much, the keyboard is from heaven, so responsive, with backlit, the processor is a monster, the GPU is enough, and more. really for 470 USD on Black Friday, is worth every penny"
141,"So far 1 week in good battery last 4-6 hours on mid performance, high performance 3-4 hours low performance 7+ hours depending on the task your doing. I’ll update review once I’ve used this laptop more one thing I will say is the build quality is good especially the keyboard and fingerprint reader. My other complaint is the mouse pad is poor quality it's just not a good feeling would recommend getting a mouse and using it to the bare minimum. It does the job but it feels weird because of the plastic."
142,"There’s nothing not to love about this laptop. Setup was super easy, and it has so many ease-of-use features, I’m still gobsmacked. I’ve only had it a couple of days, and here’s what I love already:- The keyboard is excellent, with large letters and an adjustible backlight.- Screen is bright and crisp.- This thing is quiet! Even when the fan turns on, you can barely hear it.- The bottom is designed to allow air to flow beneath it, so it doesn’t overheat.- Battery life is impressive.- At 3.2 pounds, it’s pretty light considering everything it can do.- The deep blue color is such a nice change from black or silver.My only concern—and it’s negligible—is that the casing is plastic, not metal. I’m a klutz, and I worry what will happen if I drop it. But, that means it’s never cold to the touch, and keeps it lightweight.I’m not a gamer, so I can’t speak to its usefulness for that, but so far it’s great for Adobe Creative Suite apps and Office 365.At this price point, for this sweet little machine, you can’t go wrong. I literally have a crush on my laptop, lolz."
143,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I purchased this laptop for my boyfriend on Christmas to lure him gaming with me on pc, and it worked! ❤ It's March now and I can't believe how much I've enjoyed having this laptop. If you are looking for a budge laptop that can run Valorant, Dead by Daylight, CS-GO, Phasmophobia (just to name a few) on medium settings (the game runs smooth and looks great) well, buy this laptop! Get yourself a monitor, mouse and keyboard and you'll get the feel of having a PC for only 500 dollars. It can keep with my pc and I am grateful to some of the other reviews that lead to me purchasing this laptop."
144,"This is a basic modern laptop.  It'll be faster than anything from 5 years ago.  It's nice for every day tasks.  And can even do minor gaming with it's on board processor.  I'd recommend if needing to do anything heavier duty graphics wise, look into something with a dedicated graphics card.  Lack of a touch screen and 2 in 1 functionality makes it less portable.  It's a great machine otherwise and is plenty fast.  It doesn't get too hot when doing minor gaming."
145,"I purchased this laptop originally for videoconferencing, web browsing, and watching movies, but was pleasantly surprised with how it did in gaming. 120+ fps in fortnite on high at 1080p, 60fps in minecraft with medium settings, 120+ fps in league and smite on medium for each. This is after replacibg the 4gb sodimm that came with the laptop with a 16gb sodimm. Great bang for your buck if you can't afford a more expensive ""gaming"" laptop."
146,"I love this laptop, except the battery life was weak the one time I gamed on it. However, I haven't had it very long. Screen size is a bit small, but can't complain for the price with Windows 11 and 8GB RAM"
147,"One of the better budget laptops that I've purchased in a while, the new apple MacBook is way overpriced for my budget. The mouse pad sensitivity works great and the keyboard is pretty standard for most laptops.The portability and battery life is also typical, I usually don't have to charge too often with what I use it for. Overall good laptop."
148,We are very satisfied with this computer.  It has been several years since we purchased a lap top.  So far--this has been very good to work with.  It is so much faster.  This brand came highly recommended by someone in the tech.field.  Nothing negative to say.
149,"It took me 3-4 hours to get a new printer on my home network because of Windows 11 S. The folks at Canon were very helpful but ultimately I had to turn it over to Microsoft to setup Windows 11. Windows 11 S will only allow you to add Microsoft Apps and doesn't allow networking. I really like the Lenovo laptop but this should be a toggle to switch out of Safe mode. Microsoft prefers you use only their apps in order to avoid potential pitfalls with generic apps. Also this laptop does not have a CD/DVD Drive. I wanted to load my copy of Home and Business 2010 office but Microsoft no longer supports the app so I had to ""rent"" new Office at a initial cost of $70 a year. Screen quality is great and I really like the touch screen"
150,Got this laptop bcuz of windows 11 while unboxing it i realised it had windows 10 safe mode sigh.
151,Easy to setup and great design
152,"I really like it, I use it for online teaching.  It is great, the hdmi access is so much easier."
153,"So far I like it but as the headline states, it doesn't have windows 11 installed, only window 10 in safe mode.  Update: easily upgraded to Windows 11."
154,Clean lines and extremely functional. Very Happy with the speed and performance. I would recommend it for the daily user.
155,"Unfortunately,  I didn't need this item, but heard it was a great find. I was able to get my current laptop fixed"
156,The affordable prices....
157,"This is a good decent laptop for school kids or college students. Not for business use. The specs on the sellers site are deceiving. The screen quality is not what it says. It's just a typical LCD screen that has a little more brightness than it's older predecessor. It does not have backlit keys and the keyboard lettering can't hardly be seen.The laptop feels cheap and fragile. I get worried when carrying it. Hard drive is not upgradeable. The battery life does not last as long as stated in the Sellers site. We ran tests using several programs and browsing the internet. Overall, it is not designed for creative design. As stated it is good for home use, school kids and college students. Not good for traveling even though it is a little light and it is overpriced. We donated ours to a school."
158,Camera and microphone didn’t work. Called hp for help. Told me it was a refurbished computer and couldn’t fix the problem. Takes very long time to get your money back. Be Aware!!
159,"As I expected, and unfortunately am right...this is LOUSY and I do NOT need the frustration...First it said I wasn't hooked up with Microsoft....then when I called for help it told me to go to the website!! Finally I got a human being....they said we could bypass MIcrosoft....(when doe sTHAT become a problem?)  To do THAT...i had to shut down my rotor, with other household members using it...NO  WAY...It is going BACK in the box and BACK to Amazon in the morning..I did NOT pay all this money for frustration and irritation....No idea when I'll ever order another NEW computer....I'll stick to used TYVM"
160,"Reviewing laptopHP 15 Laptop, 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 Processor, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD Storage, 15.6” Full HD IA new, light, well designed product.  The camera is not as good as described but totally acceptable for an online class. This version works well with zoom, can handle advanced features like virtual background. Set up was easy"
161,Nice laptop except the keyboard has grey lettering on silver keys. Now who thought that was a good idea?  Definitely not this customer. I contacted customer service who told me that the keyboard should be backlit but it is not. Returned and ordered a Dell that I can read the keyboard. Will not even think about another HP as long as the keyboard is this color combination. Sad for a good computer to be hampered this way.
162,"My job is Senior Business Intelligence Developer and Analyst, and I'm working remotely. To say this laptop is good for students but not for business use is just false. I'm able to do absolutely everything without lag and without issues. In my spare time, I also do music using Soundtrap. I plug a USB keyboard and microphone/guitar interface into this laptop and I'm able to create multi-track songs. My caps lock does have an indicator light that works, and I have zero complaints or issues. Maybe some people are reviewing an earlier model? I purchased mine in February of 2022, and the OS is Windows 11 Home. Actually, I bought 2; One for me and one for a family member who does graphics with Gimp. The laptops are great and we have no complaints."
163,Set up was a breeze. Screen size and keyboard are great. The price was great. I'm glad it's not a touchsceen. I had that feature on my last one and I would only recommend that if you really need it. Brushing hair or lint off the screen always messed things up. So far this laptop has been awesome and just what i needed.
164,"I've had this product for about a month and really have no complaints.  Boots up quick with no delay.  My only issue is with the on/off switch.  It's too small.  Also, I miss not having an indicator light showing when ""caps lock"" is on.  Other than these two issues I really like the unit!"
165,"I purchased this new HP Laptop from Amazon.  After it was received, the first time I tried to use it for a Zoom meeting I could hear the participants but they could not hear me.  It is under warranty with HP.  I contacted HP Support and spent over 10 hours with technicians wherein they try to diagnose and fix.  They tried everything and eventually tried reformatting the Windows 10 operating system.  All to no avail.  Internal microphone would not work.  They have since arranged for the computer to be returned to HP for repair.  It took about 7 days to receive the box for return.  I sent the computer to HP for repair location the following day.  I have no idea how long it will take for it to arrive at HP's repair facility and thereafter have it fixed and returned.  I also have no idea whether it can be fixed and am not happy that I purchased a new computer and immediately am dealing with a necessary repair."
166,"Laptop arrived with AMD ryzen 5500 instead of Intel core I5 11th generation. Description should be clear, I bought 2 laptops and specifically selected them based in the processor. I feel cheated."
167,Cheap maid. Did not like it for the money @!!
168,"I bought this laptop for scientific computing, and I was waiting for one with an 8-core processor for parallelized computations. When I saw a Ryzen 8-core processor, 32 GB RAM, and the price, ~$900 before tax, it ticked. This HP-Ryzen laptop exceeded my expectations in speed and energy efficiency. I ran a benchmark test of Wolfram Mathematica (the software I use for computations) and the results were far above all other computers listed there for comparison. At the same time, the laptop does not consume much energy, its power adapted is small. I run a parallelized computation using all 8 cores for hours and the laptop's body is only a little bit warm. I do not hear any sound of the fan. This is a huge step forward in comparison to my previous laptops with Intel i7 processors that consumed a lot of energy and were getting hot even in the idling regime.On the other hand, it is apparently not a gaming laptop as it has an AMD Radeon graphics card, no expensive Nvidia that I don't need. Comparable gaming laptops (8 cores) on Amazon cost twice as much.I haven't found any serious drawbacks yet. A small drawback is that the keyboard is not illuminated from within, the body of this laptop and its keys are gray, while inscriptions on the keys are not white but grayish. With low light, you don't see them well, and you cannot work at night without a light. The keyboard is much better visible on my preceding Dell Inspiron laptop (Intel i5, also energy efficient and overall good) that has a black surface and keys, white key inscriptions, and keyboard illumination."
169,"great update from my 10 yr old lenovo t430.it is light and super fast, sturdy built and i like the touch.setup was easy and upgraded to win 11 in no time. fabulous interface. like the new windows!very happy with the purcahse."
170,Overall performance of the laptop is good. I primarily bought it for educational purposes and it definitely meets my needs.
171,It never worked as it should it seemed to be reconditioned
172,"I use the laptop for PowerPoints, projection, Xcel, etc.  Utilize it on a network and it hooked right up and worked great.  Not a single complaint.  Love it!"
173,My people say it works great!
174,"Mic doesn't pick up well when speaker is off or at edge of camera, but it is faster than the Ryzen 5 I murdered, lighter weight, too. I thought I would miss my 17in screen, but 15in is okay since the resolution is good."
175,"I purchased this item for my mom, so she can do her work out virtually due to the virus.I looked around at the different CPU's in the computers and the ram etc8 core at 2.0ghz and 4gs of ddr4 is perfect for this laptop and 8 cores is quite rare in a small netbook.THE GOOD: It booted up in about 3-4 seconds and made it to the home screen in about 3 seconds after typing in password. The webpages loaded super fast and so did all the applications. The webcam looks great for 720p and so do the pictures! The OS is smooth and layed out intuitively. ITS LIGHT and the battery last forever, the screen is plenty bright AND has USB-C and 3.0 connections(I believe it was 3.0) The white shell is very nice looking and just looks great!THE BAD: The only lag I noticed was when in Youtube and makin a video full screen, took about 1- 1 1/2 seconds to happen, nothing crazy or weird.The webpages load"
176,"Did not like the fact that I would have had to sign in to Google to use the laptop and access internet each time. What if I want to type a paper in the park? It is my computer! Also...at the second try to turn it on...it said ""Chrome Os missing or damaged""...I returned the Chromebook. It has been at Amazon 4 days and no refund....a week since I returned it."
177,I bought this for my daughter who's in middle school doing remote learning. The chromebook exceeded my expectations and daughter is happy. She can do homework and watch shows too. The battery last a couple days without charging. I was scared for the price (is really cheap) but is totally worth it!
178,"So this is a pretty good laptop!I use it to look up and research topics for classes as well as Google services such as Google Docs or Google Sheets! It's not a Macbook, let's be clear. But streaming videos on Youtube or Netflix? Works great!! Need to type up a research paper (possibly last minute at 11:25)? Works great!! I got this to last me through community college as well! I know I need to use Office in college next year, so when I do, if it works, I'm going to try and remember to update this review. Even if you aren't a student, this works pretty good!I would not use this for heavy gaming or anything though! I got this is December and it's mid February and it's so far so good! I had an HP Chromebook that I believe was a lemon. Despite that, I took a chance getting this and opened my wallet to getting a warranty just in case! Overall, I believe I would buy again based on it's performance so far!"
179,Hello! I purchased this computer for school but the gag is I can barely even use it for school. You CAN NOT download respondus lockdown browser (information I tried to look up before I bought the computer but there was no mention of the subject) and the wifi is janky. It connected to my schools wifi at first and then boom it disconnected and hasn’t let me connect back ever sense. It says I have the wrong “user and password” but I use the same user and pw to connect on my phone and there’s no problems. It’s also extremely slow even if your wifi is good. I would recommend just spending a couple more hundred dollars and getting a laptop that’s worth it instead of wasting your money on this junk and having to buy a new laptop eventually. Sucks since this is my first experience with a chrome book but I’ll definitely NEVER buy one again. Should’ve stuck with Mac. DONT SAY I DIDNT WARN YOU!
180,"Ordered for eldest child (age 10) for home school work. It does what he needs - ability to join video classes, and in downtimes be able to watch videos and play an occasional game. It's not high spec, so you're not going to play the latest games on it, but does what we needed it for, and he's very happy with it."
181,"Poor screen quality but I did buy the least expensive Chromebook I could find. Thinking about it, knowing what I know now, I would have spent a bit more to get a better quality screen. Otherwise very responsive computer."
182,"What a horrid Chromebook, my fourth, and this was by far worse than the Samsung and the two acers, my last just got put in the garbage as the screen would go black and never recover. This HP screen would split and then you'd have to shut down to get the screen whole again. It would lock up and this was just one day. I need a small laptop for travel and have no clue what to try next.  Screen quality was very dim and I thought this was touch screen but not."
183,"I'm a home health RN and need a laptop with at least 12 hours of battery life & something small enough to carry around. THIS LAPTOP IS PERFECT FOR MY USAGE!!! Seriously! Light weight!!! The battery lasts well over 12 hours with non-stop usage. I exchanged my first package sent due to the laptop being extra slow and the ""W"" not working after a couple of days. But the replacement came fast & the seller made the whole exchange beyond easy with no stress! 10/10 would recommend for those who need a quality lap top with high battery life & light/easy to store. It works quickly and is great quality! Especially for the price! Highly recommend for use for school, work, home, & all others! Very happy with my purchase and the quality!"
184,LOVE IT SO MUCH ... got it for my college classes and in so much LOVE with it!!!!
185,"Disliked it.The reason I bought this was to hold my stuff because my cell phone had to much storage and my phone was slowing down. My photos of my grandkids was the main reason I needed more storage. I also use it for my scrapbooking which is good. I really didnt expect it to be great because it was refurbished, but as soon as I unboxed it to set it all up and make sure it was clean and defragmented it I was very disappointed  because I found that I had to do alot to the laptop. Thankgod for watching youtube I was able to clean alot of the storage out that was in the laptop. I thought that since it was refurbished that at least it was set to Factory reset because I had a feeling it was used so I needed to know if anything had to be done. Well As soon. As I opened up my Windows 10 on my hp laptop Isee that there was still files on it and I needed to clean it all out.Just remember when buying g a refurbished laptop please please please check all that's needed to be done in order to have a decent fast running computer."
186,"I bought this computer intending to use it for limited purposes.  In my case, I've dedicated this unit for my financial bookkeeping and it does well for this.  However, I already knew that the processor was on the lower rung of the computer ladder, so I did not intend using it for games and/or entertainment purposes."
187,The screen quality is great. Works very easily with my cricut design space
188,"I loved it at first, but after a few weeks, it freezes and crashes EVERYTIME I try to log into anything, and says an error occured, then freezes up. I have to manually restart it and wait, only for it to do it again. Not happy to say the least, and will be getting an refund."
189,Nice laptop
190,"Doesn’t run smoothly, the intel processor is crap, I gave it a chance but honestly my old laptop that I had since 2010 works way better"
191,"I have an Andriod, so I use Google to sync EVERYTHING.Windows 10 S doesn't let you use Chrome browser. You are allowed to use ONLY Edge. I can't stand Edge as it is. Even went I worked for Microsoft for 12 years, I used Firefox and them Chrome. When I found out that they are using this tactic to force people to use this junky browser I was completely disgusted.Microsoft and these slimy tactics on the one hand; on the other hand, we have the iphone forcing people to use charger ports that only work with iphones, often making them pay $35 for an inferior cable that isn't very fast and will break within 6 months, only to change it on them at the next model upgrade.These two companies are so gross. It's no wonder most of the world outside of the US uses Android or Samsung. USB-C is the way to go. Superfast, super affordable.I'm returning this machine for regular Windows 10."
192,The key board lags. Everything else is good about it.
193,"I saved $500 on a laptop by buying this refurbished one.I'm very happy with the picture, DPI, but a little disappointed with the available volume."
194,"I ordered this laptop as a replacement from the 1st 1 I purchased ( different company) the 1st didn’t work at all so I was pleasantly pleased when I received this laptop everything is working great , screen has no scratches, keypad works great , for the price you can’t go wrong"
195,"This is a long review.  To summarize, you get what you pay for and then some.  This is a very usable package at a bargain price.  Nothing is top-of-the-line, but you will get a nice, compact machine for web-based activity.This is my first Chromebook.  Previously I have used Macs and laptops from Toshiba and Lenovo.  I decided to go with a Chromebook because I mostly email, browse pages, Zoom, and watch Youtube.  Anything I need to do document-wise can be covered by Google.  The compactness and long battery life is a big plus.  I'm tired of big, heavy laptops wearing holes in my bags.This Chromebook weighs 2-1/4 .lbs, which is excellent.  It is about the size of a magazine, so I would not hestitate to take it anywhere.  The body is plastic, which is durable and easy to keep clean.  It's not as nice as metal, but it is generally solid.  The bottom panel is a teeny bit loose, but that is a nitpick.Battery life is as advertised.  Depending what you do you get around 10 hours or more, which is more than double any laptop I have used.The screen opens to 135 degrees (or 45 degrees against the tabletop).  I was disappointed it did not open to a full 180, but I can work with it.  Screen brightness is listed at 220 nits (on the low end), but don't let that deter you; it is as bright as my 8 year old Macbook and my Lenovo laptop assigned by work. For indoor use, it works just fine.  If you work outside, you will have to find shade.  The display quality is not the best, but perfectly useable.  It is an IPS display, which provides better viewing angles and color rendition.  The 11.6"" screen is enough real estate for watching videos and reading the news.  I can type this review and read my email side by side.  This is also a touch screen, which seems to work fine in my limited experience.  When laying down with the Chromebook on my chest, it's nice to just browse using the touchscreen.  I have downloaded a few Android games, and they work great on the touchscreen.  IMO spend more for the touch screen if you want to use Android apps.The keyboard is a comfortable size.  I am typing efficiently without making lots of mistakes.  Most of the keys are where you expect them to be.  The specialized Chrome keys don't interfere.  The keys themselves have a nice, positive response.  Equally responsive is the trackpad, which comes with a full repertoire of gestures for scrolling, zooming, and viewing apps.  One thing I noticed is you can only physically click on the botton half of the touchpad, but I usually tap to click.The on-board speakers are a nice surprise.  They are loud and clear.  An audiophile might find them slightly tinny, but I can listen to music for hours using just these speakers.  There is minimal distortion when I crank the volume up to max. Of course, there is a headphone jack and bluetooth capability.32 gigs of memory may be challenged if you install a lot of apps.  The Chrome System takes up about 13 GB on its own. I have inserted a 128 GB Micro SD card, which can be used as storage for Android apps that support it.  For example, I can download music from Youtube Music to my SD card.  Documents from the Text editor and Camera app can be directed to the SD card as well.Regarding the processor, I don't do anything that has taxed this system yet.  I usually only have a couple of tabs and apps open, and I play a few games.  Keep in mind this is the same processor on the almost universally lauded Lenovo Duet Chromebook, so it is no slouch.The 720p webcam is adquate for web conferencing, taking snapshots or recording videos.  It's a little grainy with indoor lighting.  People seem to hear me fine using the internal microphone, but works best if you are sitting right in front of the computer.  The mic input can be adjusted if you expand the volume options in the wifi/battery/time options.One last cool thing is you can charge this Chromebook with a phone charger (with the right cable).  It is slow, and must be done while the Chromebook is not in use.  I was able to get 15% per hour using a basic phone charger.  It might be nice if you are traveling and don't need to lug around the clunky power supply that comes with this Chromebook.Overall, I am happy with my purchase. This is a nice value package that delivers."
196,"I first want to say that mechanically this laptop worked great. The company that sent it also sent it very fast, arriving ahead of the projected date. Now that positivity is out of the way, why am i returning it?Say what you want about me, but i didn't realize that this device used a different OS. I originally wanted an affordable laptop for some word processing. Chrome OS does not allow you to do this. Functionally it could,  but it designed to be an internet browser and little else. Do you have a phone? Well, your phone is capable of everything this device can do and more. Why would anyone need a laptop with less functionality than a phone?Many software programs support a variety of operating systems. They do not currently work with Chrome OS. You cannot even attempt to download them. I have heard that you can download apps (not that i was able to experience this for myself), but that will be the only downloading of programs that you might have access to.This now leads to my final gripe, the device is basically online only.A browser cannot function without internet, so it is with this device. It seems to be so dependent on this that it actually bugged out when i tried to delete the only wifi connection it had. (which reminds me, there is no way that you can factory reset this device. There is no option to do so, take that as you will.) When you first start up this device, it will force you to connect to the internet. You can skip putting in you Google account info, but it will not allow you to proceed without internet.Tldr: Don't get anything with Chrome OS. Your phone is capable of so much more than this ever will be."
197,"This is a great Chromebook for a middle to highschooler. It has a real long battery life charges quickly, and maintains a strong wireless signal. The touchscreen is very responsive and we haven’t had any problems with it at all. It has a very comfortable keyboard."
198,"I only use a computer for personal stuff, e-mails, facebook, random stuff., a zoom meeting once a week. I'm 72 and needed a lighter, smaller one than my dinosaur of a laptop. This fits the bill perfectly. It weighs less than the average book, it has a very long battery life, its size and weight makes it easily portable, and I can have it outside on the deck for hours without losing power. I love the touchscreen, and it was not hard converting to the Chrome OS from Windows. The only thing this didn't offer was a backlit keyboard, but since It's white, w/white keyboard, It's not hard to see even in dim light. So easy to use and carry, and easily contains everything my old computer had downloaded--and that's a lot!  I Love It!"
199,"It's very important to note, this is a Chromebook NOT a full-sized laptop, so this may be much smaller than expected.Personally, I love this Chromebook, size and all. It works great and has a pretty decent quality. No issues with so far with charging, battery life, crashing, etc. I would only hope for a better sound quality, as it doesn't get very loud at all. Plenty of storage space for me as well, as I use it for crafting (Design Space app, emails, saving photos, etc.) I would also recommend this for those looking for something small with a keyboard for school use."
200,"This is perfect for what I need. I  am a writer and have been writing on a kindle tablet, and it was just too small."
201,"I like the Chromebook, but it restarts itself every day on its own. I've had it for less than a month. I believe the MicroSD card slot is too close to the power cord slot. I leverage my thumb on the side of the Chromebook to pull the power cord out (the spot where the MicroSD card slot is) so I end up uninstalling the card. No, there's no other way to carefully remove the power cord. I've had several Chromebooks and never had issues until this one."
202,"I didn't realize how small it was however it's a nice laptop,the screen did go black for a full day, it was charged an everything,for some weird reason it came back on, that's the only issue I've had with it"
203,"Make sure you read the fine print. I received my chromebook. The package it was in was already opened. A little annoyed I paid for a new one and got a used one but it looked ok. Plug it in to start using it and check it out. Kept saying it was charging. Unplugged it the next day only for it to cut righty back off and say it was dead. I tried another chromebook charger and the same thing happened. So I decided to get some support. Amazon was nice but made me try all the things I already did. After nothing worked, again. They told me to contact the seller, there was nothing else they could do to help me. I reached out to the seller and got no reply. And apparently I can’t return it. For any reason whatsoever. So now I have a cr*p laptop that I just wasted $ on that I guess I’ll now have to pay to take somewhere to fix it. So annoyed and disappointed. I haven’t even had it a few days and can’t even return for a replacement or to get my money back. Cool cool cool. Thanks"
204,"If my labtop goes to sleep, when I try to use it from sleep the screen is split.  The botton half is on top and the top part is on the bottom.  And nothing can be done to fix this other than logging out and shutting down and restarting the computer. This becomes very annoying after a while.  Also, with regularity, the notebook simply freezes and again, the only remedy is to shut down and restart. A third regret is that it is very, very slow, much slower than the 5-year old Acer Chromebook (similar price) that I am trying to replace because it's nearing 5-years old and Chrome no longer supports my Acer Chromebook with security updates.  The HP Chromebook is such poor quality that I don't use it anymore, I'm back to using my 5-year old Acer Chromebook.  I have a few more months until it's no longer supported.  I think I will try the Pixelbook Go, it seems to have good reviews and I have much higher hopes for it.  I'm so disappointed with the HP that I will never, ever consider another HP product.  Such low, laughable quality."
205,"The last laptop I bought - a Lenovo - had an optical drive. So nearly a decade old. But it was a total workhorse for work and home use. And needed replacement.After *lots* of reading and research I landed on the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro, in no small no part because my Samsung Galaxy 10+ phone has done so well.Also? This was in stock! Several others I looked at were either out when I started looking, or went to backorder while I was on the hunt. And the Amazon 5-payment plan was a little kinder on my budget.Screen is incredible. Backlit keyboard. RAM is nearly triple what my old machine had (16gb v 6), so using Photoshop now is no big deal while I'm using several other apps simultaneously. It sure used to be. And it takes about a second - yep - once you flip the screen open to wake.Downside? It's *very* thin and *very* light compared to my old machine, so that's taken some getting used to. I need to hold it in place while I open the screen. And right now it actually sits ON the old one when I'm working. But it's still new yet.Looks like it's a bit more expensive now ( I paid about $1100) but I think still a deal for what you'll be getting, esp if you haven't upgraded in a while as was my case.Highly recommend."
206,Super fast laptop.The screen is beautiful. I love the light weight.Nice packing.Best laptop I've ever won.The sould quality is amazing for this thin laptop. (You will have to go to the sound setting and press the advance speaker quality to activate the best sound possible)
207,This it's totally defected. I'm sending it tomorrow through UPS back to Amazon due to the fact that it will not charge. Stops at 44% and doesn't go on and it should charge in 30 minutes from what the information States. I am totally disappointed. There was no adapter in it either.
208,"Llevo unas semanas con mi Samsung Galaxy Book Pro y estoy más que feliz con ella, porque es súper rápida, sensible y con una calidad de imagen en la pantalla super espectacular ¡Lo mejor de lo mejor! Y más siendo a ese precio."
209,I absolutely hated windows 11 it's garbage and cost me down time trying to navigate is bs os
210,"Having laptops provided by employer for several years, I hadn’t purchased in a while. Usually I think budget, but this time I splurged a bit and I am very happy.Super lightweight and very fast startup and waking. AMZN also providing good link for MS 365 Office"
211,The laptop came with a faulty boot system and I had to install the Windows 11 from scratch to get it work. The laptop was unable to repair itself. It's actually a used one from the Amazon warehouse buy at least they should have warned that it might be defective.
212,Great Sound! Easily the finest laptop audio you can ask for at this price. Screen flickering at lowering brightness and does not look sharp enough for Full HD resolution. AMOLED colors are great as usual. battery life is decent.
213,Super fast machine. Fantastic screen resolution and color rendition. Lots of memory for manipulating big data files. Can't find anything to complain about. Writing code to do financial analysis on large Account Receivable files. The speed is amazing.
214,"Great device, really like it. Lightweight, fast, quiet, long battery life. Best notebook I had ever!The only disadvantage found by now - camera quality is quite poor.Even my 5 years old macbook has better camera."
215,"Update:The high pitched coil noise the fans make is super annoying. I don't know if mine is special, but it's ridiculous. I really should have sent this back and gotten a prebuilt desktop. Acer. Fix your fans!Original second review:My previous review got deleted somehow. It was very thorough on the pros and cons of this laptop. Short version.CPU gets too hot. Thermal throttles when gaming. It's not constant throttling but periodically the temperature peaks for a second then returns to a more normal range. The new Acer 1.06 bios helped a little. Instead of reaching 212 or more degrees F, it mostly reaches 203 degrees F.The Acer customer service link they give you on a card in the box does not actually work.The fans make a very slight coil whine like noise. Most people probably won't notice, But I do.I got this because of the graphics card drought."
216,"I wanted this computer for gaming (mainly Worlds of Warcraft and Steam games). It played World of Warcraft okay I guess, though the graphics were surprisingly unimpressive, especially considering the price of this machine and the rave reviews regarding graphics. The screen desktop icons were blurry even. The real killer disappointment was that this laptop was incapable of running Steam games (Wurm unlimited in particular) without constant crashing. I reached out to support and the support crew at Acer were unknowledgeable and uninterested in assisting me and the computer was straight out of the box! I tried to research the crashing myself to see if I could find a solution and so did my husband who builds computers and works in IT. Unfortunately, we could find no solution and had to return this item. About the only good things I can say for it is it was boxed prettily and had a very cool looking keyboard with pretty colors. It looks like the built in fan would help with overheating. Functionally, it doesn't work as a gaming laptop as it purpots and I am really confused as to why it gets such good reviews. I did my research for months before purchasing and this computer cost more than I wanted to spend, but it wasn't worth the money and it couldn't run a simple game that every other laptop I've ever had ran just fine. Perhaps there was a way to rectify the issue, but I'll never know since support was so unhelpful. Even so the graphics were absolutely nothing worth the price of this computer, very poor in my opinion. In fact my old Acer Aspire had far superior graphics! I hate returning things, a purchase that requires so much research, but to spend that sort of money and receive a gaming laptop that doesn't play games and with a poor picture, I had no other option. Still looking for the laptop of my gaming dreams or will see if I can fix the graphics card in my old dying laptop. What a bummer! If you like gaming, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
217,"If there were no underlying issues with this laptop I would rate as 5 Stars and higher recommend.  However, having owned this laptop for less than 30 days I've experienced too many issues and am returning for a refund.  First and foremost is the random shutdowns that occur without warning or provocation (i.e laptop idle/not overheating), refusing to open desktop applications or games (particularly Steam games), and restart times in excess of 10 minutes when system locks up.  What convinced me to return and not purchase another Helios 300 are the number of people on the Acer support forums that have experienced similar issues without resolution.  If you purchase and don't experience these issues, congrats on having an amazing gaming laptop that runs games excellently, that hasn't been my experience and must caution: buyer beware."
218,"This laptop was basically exactly what I was looking for. Before then, I never owned a true gaming PC. The only computer I owned before that wasn’t a hand-me-down was a 2016 Acer Aspire E15 with an Intel i5 and a NVIDIA GeForce 940MX graphics card with 8GB of memory. Needless to say, for any serious type of gaming, it was not to last. Games like Sonic Generations had the fan screaming in agony and the game would freeze at random points and games like Street Fighter V at lowest settings ran at about half speed. The only other modern gaming system I have was the Nintendo Switch, and while I love that system, it’s not the best main drive to play the latest blockbuster releases from 3rd Parties. And so, I began looking for a new gaming PC. I tried looking for a desktop all summer but I could never afford or find the parts I wanted and the prebuilt options didn’t impress me. But in September of this year I found this little guy and it had everything looking for it. I saved it up and got it at a discount of $1,100 with some extras such as a new mouse, mousepad, and backpack.When this PC came in, the difference to this and my old one was night and day. The screen’s higher refresh rates and 16 GB of RAM felt almost unreal to me for a bit, but it was a beautiful experience. The packaging was beautiful, the system itself looks gorgeous, but a gaming PC is only as good as it’s gaming capabilities were. Oh boy, was I amazed. The first thing I set up was the Dolphin emulator with Mario Kart: Double Dash!! and I got it set up in a matter of minutes and did some upscaling. With the combination of my trusted 8bitdo SN30 Pro+, it felt like a dream playing games on it. So far, I’ve loved all this thing has done for emulation. Granted, I’ve only set up stuff as recently as Wii U, but that system runs so well that I was convinced it was just some native PC port. From NES to Sega Saturn to Wii U and more, your emulation needs will be in good hands here.What about actual PC games? Don’t worry, it’s awesome on here. Personally, I don’t have too many PC games to use for reference so don’t take my word for everything. Sonic Generations ran beautifully at max settings (as it should since it’s a game from 2011), but when I got to Street Fighter V, it hit me just how much I could do with this. I can play this game with max settings on 1080p and it runs perfectly. Yeah, it’s a game from 2015/2016 on the PS4 so I should expect this, but keep in mind that my previous PC couldn’t even do this game at minimum settings and you can see why I’m so happy about this. The experience was nothing short of brilliant. And the fan, while not silent, isn’t nearly as bad as I thought it would be. Unless you put the PC into Turbo Mode with overclocking, the fan is more than passable and won’t be much of a distraction. The speakers are great as expected, and even on lower settings are quite well and projected perfectly. I’m not the type of guy to blare my game’s volumes on 100% but if that’s you, you’ll have some fun with this guy. The screen, as mentioned, is nothing short of beautiful. Great colors, viewing angles, and a great refresh rate makes viewing stuff on this as good as you could want from a 1080p IPS display. As long as you don’t expect a $3,000 monster machine performance, you’ll be in good hands here.While I’ve raved about this PC for a while, there are a few things I could’ve wished they did better with. Thankfully, this system is decent when it comes to built in stuff but the boot-up sound is a little annoying. Thankfully, it can be turned off which I did right away. The screen, as I said before, is lovely, but I kind of wish it was a 4K panel. I’m not sure how well this guy does with 4K content, but I guess I’d rather do 1080p at 144 FPS than 4K at 60 FPS. It’s kinda up to you. The battery life isn’t hot. It’s advertising to doing about 6 hours in it’s own but I wouldn’t expect that. This is certainly something you keep on your desk plugged in at all time. Plus, performance is hit pretty badly if it’s not plugged in so this isn’t something I’d want to keep on my lap. My third biggest issue is the process of replacing storage and RAM. My last computer handled this well, with a little door to change everything on the bottom with little to no problems. But, despite being a gaming product where a majority of people would want to change this stuff easily, you can’t. You gotta take off the back, use a prying tool to lift up the click in order to expose the bottom and take it off. I don’t know what’s up with mine, but I can’t do it. I bought a Samsung 1TB M.2 drive to improve the adequate but lacking 512 GB of internal storage. But nope, the clips would not only refuse to come off no matter what I did, but the top part that I needed to get off was stick like glue. I had to stop trying because I was either going to permanently damage the insides or do more cosmetic harm to the bottom play. Thankfully, the nicks aren’t too noticeable and the only part that got scratched was the top left hand part of the bezel of the screen. But still, what gives, Acer? This is a gaming PC, not a MacBook. I get you companies like making these laptops as non-modular as possible, but you’re shooting yourself in the foot with product longevity. If it weren’t for the fact that everything else with this computer is everything I could’ve wanted, this would’ve been an absolute dealbreaker for me. But ultimately, whether or not this is a major issue to you is something I cannot declare. That’s up to you.Regardless, besides not being a $3,000 tank of a gaming PC and having some annoying restrictions in terms of user configurations, I’m nothing short of happy with this product. Compared to my last laptop, this one is the real deal that will last me throughout college. This is probably one of the few purchases I’ve made where I can say that it was worth every penny. But, c’mon Acer, stop with this bottom plate garbage. You’re better than this. Other than that, kudos to you and your engineering team earns my respect."
219,"This Acer Predator laptop is more expensive than other Acer brand lower level gaming laptops, but it's hardly upgradable. It has weird design in the bottom case with very sticky parts on the hinge and side. Even with proper toolkit, it's difficult to open the entire bottom case for RAM and SSD expansion. Most importantly, the laptop comes with Windows 10 Home 20H2 version OS. After initial set up of the laptop, it requires to do mandatory updates to keep up with the current system. After a few seconds of wait, the laptop tries to restart and said Windows updates are running. Then the nightmare loop happens again and again. The restart process has repeated over 50 times, but the laptop has not finished Windows updates for more than 10 hours. Just returned the laptop with original box and accessories to Amazon within 24 hours receiving it. Do not bother to contact the manufacturer for technical support, since they will tell you to do the same. The only way to resolve the issue is to open the bottom case and take out the SSD to wipe out the defective Windows 10 Home OS 20H2 version (it's not compatible with latest 11th gen intel processor), and then reinstall Windows 10 Home 21H1 or Windows 11 on the laptop. You cannot do that on your own, since the laptop's bottom case is very difficult to open."
220,"**Update **Vine reviewers do not realize some crucial ssd's simply don't work with this laptop.This model doesn't work with some crucial SSD's. I exchanged mine for a different one and had the same issues. Put the crucial ssd in my desk where it works fine, and ordered a Samsung SSD for this laptop. It worked right away. It's infuriating that they give reviewers free products and they go down a list of all the other products they got for free that they ASSUME work with this machine.Oddly enough, I had a 2012 Acer predator desktop that didn't work with crucial ssd's. Good desktop besides that's. What's Acer's beef with Micron? Decade later with the exact same issues.After getting the Samsung SSD, everything works perfect. Form factor is impressive, battery is par for a gaming laptop (what do you expect from the thirsty specs?), doesn't get super hot, the fans keep it comfortable below 80 most of the time, even with performance mode and demanding games. It's only pushing a 1080 screen, but with the 144 hz it looks so good.**Original Review**This laptop was too good to be true for me.11th gen i7, 3060, 16 gb ram. High power support for 3060. If you're looking to add an SSD to add storage like I was, do your homework. Amazon and Acer have pigeon holed so many of these same named models into the same listing that it's nearly impossible to find help for your specific model online. Besides that it was a great machine. Venting was phenomenal, battery was excellent for a gaming laptop.I ordered a crucial ssd to put into the extra slot, my predator came with the slot for an extra SSD, a ribbon to plug into the motherboard, and screws to attach the SSD to the mount. I thought it had been bricked initially. Completely unresponsive, fans running 100%, screen flickered once to a different shade of black. Rewatched ACER's own video on how to install it to see if I missed a step, it wasn't rocket science.Had to unplug the battery, unplug my extra hard drive, replug in the battery and allow it to charge for a bit. Somehow the battery life tanked over the course of 30 minutes.Did all the no brainer trouble shooting items like install the latest bios update, try hardrive in another machine to isolate the issue.I came across two different possible reasons for my particular issue. In a random review from a different year and completely different backplate to the laptop a consumer reported that Acer had shipped his Predator with the wrong SSD ribbon, they had shipped him one ment for the Swift laptop. When they traded him out it seemed to fix his issue.Reading another thread, a user had my same issue from a few years ago as well. Acer had told him to change the boot sequence in the bios. It was trying to boot from the blank/reformatted secondary ssd. I reformatted the SSD I was trying to add in a different machine. Whenever the SSD was plugged in, the laptop simply would t respond. It was a black screen and button presses did nothing. There wasn't even the short bios flash you usually get. Even tried spamming F11 and del to try and blindly access it.I spent most of today trying to get it to work. I loved my first Acer back in 2012 and a few others after and was excited to come back to them. For the price and feature set it is an unreal value, but I specifically chose this over the MSI I was eyeballing because of the secondary ssd bay. I can't wait another month for a replacement, only to have the replacement have the same issue. There's no support. I need to send it back and just pony up the money for a brand with better support. Flukes are frustrating but blindly trying to fix a brand new device is even worse."
221,"I do t like that the ram is locked at gear mode 2 effectively cutting your ram speed in half.  Even after unlocking the bios, there's nothing you can do because there isn't support for xmp.  Everything is jdec spec.Undervolting is essential, and -70mv is pretty much gaurenteed stable and it makes my cinebench scores go up substantially as the cores don't thermal throttle anymore under load.  A cooling pad can help.The thing I really don't like tho is the nvme speed.  Even at pcie4.0 x4 which both ports are supposed to support, crystaldiskinfo only gives me 50-70mbps read speed and 330mbp write.  Raid0 doesn't do much for it either.  For comparison, the sata SSD I added with rapid mode on is 700/800mbps respectively.No one seems to point out the slow nvme speeds and this has been consistent for me from two of these laptops.  Also, in the unlocked bios I can change the default display color depth from 18 to 24bit.  Why that ain't default is beyond me.Anyways, other than that it works great lol.Otherwise, it runs great"
222,"The Good:Speed. Speed. And more speed.The extra bay allowed me to place my old hard drive in it as a bootable device, so I lost nothingI have not had any operating issues at all and it has handled everything I've thrown at it soo far, but I am not a super-high-end gamerThe Downsides:Opening case to add old hard drive requires special tool, but I was able to use blunt end of window razor instead of buying one. If your not comfortable working on stuff and/or don't have the tool, then you may need to pay to have it done.There is bleed in the corners. If it is something that bothers you, then you will be annoyed. I, personally, don't play anything where it is noticeable to me unless I look for it.  But it is very obvious on a black screen.My skin PH balance is weird. My skin will destroy all metals except real gold. Where my left palm rests on it, the paint is literally gone and it shows bare metal. I'm not sure if it is my PH or an issue with it's construction, but it doesn't effect anything to go through the problem of doing a return."
223,"This is a great little laptop with lots of power for the price.  Gen 11 i7, an RTX 3060, Thunderport 4, and a very bright 144 Hz display.  But there are plenty of reviews that will list out all the wonderful specs.  Here are my only complaints.  I do have some light bleed around the top and bottom edges of the screen which is disappointing.  It is hard to find the battery specs on this laptop but I think it is something like 59 MAH.  You you pack this much horse power in a chasey I wish it contained a max 99 MAH battery.  There is an extra 2.5"" drive bay next to the battery, it would be awesome to offer a bigger battery option at the sacrifice of the drive bay.  Lastly, a MUX switch would have been great.  I understand this would add to the cost but I would pay extra for those options and a MUX switch it relatively cheap to build into a laptop.  Other than that, I researched close to 30 laptops before settling on this one and it did not disappoint."
224,"This laptop performs phenomenally! Capable of running Elden Ring at 1440p High settings @60fps! That’s incredible and I love it. Currently using the laptop for on the go gaming and editing whilst also using it on downtime with my 4K 55” and it works perfect! This thing can run a surprising amount of games at 4K and 1440p perfectly fine. The system gives a lot of fan settings to really tune it up to how you want it to play. Extreme mode is the best for absolute gaming but it can get very loud, I recommend default of Quite if you plan to just watch YouTube or something. Build quality is strong and the keyboard is great! Beautiful system all around."
225,"First off: the RAM in this model is *not* upgradeable, but the SSD is. I just upgraded it the other night myself and checked with ASUS; the RAM is soldered to the motherboard.That aside, it still runs plenty fine and I haven't experienced any problems. Getting the back off to get into the guts was a PITA, but just take your time and be patient.I turned off Windows S to get the full experience, and upgraded to Windows 11 within a couple of weeks of having it. I also dual-booted a Linux build with Fedora 34 and Cinnamon desktop/Wayland, and the screen rotation works like a champ.It's not feather-weight, but it's plenty light enough for casual use, surfing on the couch, etc. without noticing it. The ports are good, especially the Thunderbolt USB-C. It's great to have a single cable and charger for all our needs (2 Pixel 4a 5Gs, MacBook Pro, 2 Fire tablets), and the battery life is good. I don't game so I can't speak to that, but I'm also guessing that this laptop isn't intended for gamers.The 14"" form is perfect: not too small or cramped, not too big.I'm really enjoying this laptop, and it you're looking for a good general use laptop, I recommend it."
226,"This laptop is a 2-in-1 style.  It has a metal top and a plastic bottom (although underneath/inside the bottom cover it is lined with a thin sheet of metal) for heat dissipation.It arrives in Windows S mode. I upgraded to Windows 10 Home.There are only two stickers on the laptop, but I was surprised to see fun laptop stickers in the box!It comes with a barrel style charger, but it can be charged by usb-c also.The resolution is 1920x1080 out of the box, set to 150% scaling. On-screen icons were too big for me, so I reduced the scaling to 100%.I benchmarked it in Geekbench under Windows 10. I ran it three times and got these scores.1227 single core and 2763 multicore.1325 single core and 2801 multicore.1319 single core and 2756 multicore.You can switch between Performance Mode, Standard Mode, and Whisper Mode by pressing Fn + F.  I saw marginal gains in Performance Mode: 1334 single core, and 2823 multicore.OpenCL scored 9542 and Vulkan scored 8493.I took the bottom off to confirm my fears.  This pc is running a single channel of 4gb of ram. It is not user upgradable.  It does have a removable 128GB eMMC drive from Foresee though.  Removing the bottom cover is not difficult, but there are lots of different sized screws, including two hidden under the feet.Despite only having 4gb of ram, it is surprisingly useful.  I even upgraded it to the Beta Channel of Windows 11 after benchmarking it.Overall, this is a nice laptop, with a premium slim look, that only falls short on its internal specs.  If you can find this laptop with better specs, it would be worth buying the upgraded model in my opinion.  At this time, I don’t know if there is an upgraded model.  Otherwise, don’t plan on gaming or multitasking much with this laptop."
227,"I am reviewing this laptop primarily from the perspective of a creative home user. I like drawing on computers quite a bit at this point, coming from my Surface Book 2. So I was very curious how much laptop one could get for about a quarter of the price (sans Asus Pen 2, which ran me an extra hundo).BUILD QUALITY and FEATURESBuild quality is where the budget nature of the device shows. The body is black brushed aluminum and picks up finger smudges pretty easily. The power button is a tiny little nub on the side of the body which is impossible to locate by feel. The barrel plug feels very 2012. On the sides we find a mere 2 full size USB ports, but interestingly, a full sized HDMI port, USB-C port, and micro-SD expansion port. This last comes in quite handy if you want to store files locally, as the included SSD is a mere 128gb, with less than 100gb free.Windows 10 is in S mode, which can easily be circumvented if you want to run non-Windows Store programs. Windows Hello is not available via webcam, but a fingerprint sensor is included on the track pad. It works, but is a bit finicky. The trackpad is rather small, but it is reasonably accurate and navigating the device by that means is not laborious.The hinge itself is pretty solid and there is minimal wobble in the screen when in laptop mode. The hinge spins all the way around to put the laptop into ""Tablet"" mode. Now, this is a far cry from a Surface Book detachable tablet, since the keyboard stays attached, but it's not half bad. There are small rubber feet on the keyboard tray that allow you to place the device quite sturdily onto a tabletop in drawing mode. The screen also settles into the tablet orientation with a satisfying solidity, and does not wobble when drawn upon. You're not going to use this like a true tablet, but it's more than acceptable for drawing on.SCREEN and AUDIOThe screen is a 1920 by 1080 16:9 display, which does feel rather dated after coming from a 2:3 display. It gets reasonably bright, but not bright enough for sunny outdoor use in my opinion. Off angle viewing is pretty good. It's not premium, and is nowhere near as impressive as the panels on a Surface Book or MacBook laptop. But it's a far cry from the budget laptops of ten years ago.I was very impressed by the audio, however. This laptop gets loud, the sound is pretty rich for a laptop, and it doesn't distort at high volumes. This is an ideal device if you want to stream video or watch YouTube.DRAWINGI have previously used two different screen drawing setups - Surface Book and Surface Pen, and Acer Switch with Acer Stylus (from 2016). The latter was pretty wretched by comparison, so I was very curious about the VivoBook. I am happy to report that in the last 5 years, ""budget"" Windows inking devices have come a very long way. The Asus Pen 2 is quite responsive and the VivoBook was swift enough to register real-time strokes in Sketchbook, Zenbrush, and Spirality. Diagonal lines did not suffer from much jitter at all. The Surface Book still takes the prize for accuracy and responsiveness, but if you're looking for a drawing laptop on the cheap, the VivoBook is no slouch and comes quite close!CONCLUSIONI don't have a hard time recommending this to the right user. It would be a terrific school laptop for a young student who needs Zoom, word processing, web browsing, and inking. It is more than enough laptop to do light office duties, but it's not going to blow through the Adobe suite or do heavy video editing with only a Core i3 and Intel integrated GPU. I do think this is a very compelling budget option for an artist who wants to do drawing in a Windows environment, as long as they don't want to do it with PhotoShop, which is too much for these internals. But it handles Autodesk Sketchbook and similar applications with aplomb. Yes, you'll have to plump for an extra pen, but t he same is true of Microsoft's Surface line."
228,"I love the look and feel of this laptop. Corners are a little sharp which I don't mind so much. Coming from a 2012 Toshiba laptop, this thing is light, its fast and it gets the job done. Touch screen is very receptive and the colors are bright. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
229,"First time I ordered it, it would not turn on or charge. ""Okay, it's defective"", I say. No worries. I return it for another one. Second one comes, great. It turns on. It charges. I am happy. I get it all set up the way I need it. take it out of S mode etc. Then, 1 day later, the monitor breaks down and won't display. I try a few times. Turn it on, turn it off, hold the button for 40 seconds like the ""help"" page said. Nothing. Blank screen.Goodbye ASUS VivoBook Flip 14.I may have to get a more expensive model from a different brand, but 2 headaches inside a week ain't worth what I paid here. Nothing is. I am happy for those of you who got one that consistently works, ASUS is a good brand. I have a PC and a laptop that are both terrific years later, but two defective products in a row is the beginning of a pattern I'd rather not go through, especially during the holidays.However, when this VivoBook was working it was a nice little laptop, so it's a shame really."
230,"I did not like how this product only has four gigabytes ram that is not expandable. I'm an artist who needs to use Adobe fresco and Adobe fresco requires 8 GB RAM and that's why I bought this computer. But it doesn't have an expandable ram slot you don't have the ability to upgrade and that screws me big time. If they didn't have so many models that were the same exact name, I would have been able to check for the specs but apparently there are many different versions of the vivo book 14. Seriously misleading"
231,"I expected this little laptop to underperform my 10th gen i5 wifi 6 laptop. Surprisingly, it performs at the same level. Speeds via Ookla's test site are 620-630 mbs download near my wifi 6 router with Comcast's 600 mbs service, and 40 feet away in another room they still test at 240 mbs download. Web pages load at the same speed as the i5.Where this computer excels is its screen. I think it's on par with our iPad and iPhone screens for color depth, sharpness, and viewing angle...far better than other laptops, except for maybe MS Surface, in the sub-$1,000 price range. The touchscreen and touchpad work flawlessly.The speakers are clear and volume can be loud, much better than my 2018 VivoFlip, which couldn't crank out much volume.The keys are large, and the tactile feel is just right for accurate touch-typing, also much better than my other laptops. The keyboard backlighting has three brightness levels plus off.I also expected the battery life to be less than my 2018 VivoFlip, but it's actually quite good. Unless you're watching a movie, it should last several hours in normal usage."
232,"I have an ASUS Chromebook that my children bought me for a X-mas present a few years ago. It is lightweight and great for online shopping  (since it is touchscreen) while sitting on the sofa. However, it has no USB port, Did not have access to Microsoft Word and Windows. I am a teacher, so I need access to Word, Google.docs, PPT and all the other software and apps teachers use. This new ASUS ViviBook gives me everything I need in the compact size and with the touchscreen I already liked. The added advantage is that it folds on the lap like a tablet. Quality at an affordable price!"
233,"So..this laptop is amazing. Totally amazing.The ability to flip the screen and turn it into a giant tablet is wicked cool.The touchscreen is responsiveThe computer speed and storage is top notchthe keyboard is nice, and quiet keys. Has a backlight to make typing easier.when you flip the computer into tablet mode, it turns off the input from the keyboard. it allows for seamless transitions from laptop to tablet.i haven't found anything that i don't like about this laptop. it is a solid choice for students and typical household use. recommend!!"
234,"The first thing about this computer was a lack of privacy, when I logged on to my amazon account through this device all of a sudden Amazon kept asking me to prove I was my own account holder through my own devices. ALSO, MY PASSWORDS WERE BEING CHANGED MAKING VERY TEDIOUS THE RECOVERY OF MY ACCOUNT AMONG OTHER THINGS AS WELL SUCH AS BILLING ERRORS. Before I used this computer everything with Amazon was very smooth going.  Then the computer requires you to begin an account with Microsoft and the tells you the account does not exist. I have been back and forth on this computer very many times. I am well acquainted with the use of computers. This computer puts the user through a bunch of unecessary steps to get anything done. I bought this computer for my child and we started the first email account and password for him and then were told the account doesn,t exist. This computer is seriously dysfunctional. The speeds are not consistent with advertising and the battery life is neither capable to manage a days worth of laptop running about 3 hours fully charged or as advertised. The sound chip is attacked a day after you start to begin using making no sound whatsoever and the pointer  stops working on the second day. The computer seems to have an overcontroler which makes the computer not yours. Most changes you make to it are overridden by some unknown hand. Even when I am using separate accounts for my children and myself. It does not Apparantly give you the owner control of your own computer. It is designed for you to buy extra features which they are willing to sell you. There are very minimal apps esspecially for children. A very disappointing buy at $470. I am an experienced computer user. This computer has serious issues for which  are very questionable for a computer which belongs to the owner."
235,We are very satisfied with this computer.  It has been several years since we purchased a lap top.  So far--this has been very good to work with.  It is so much faster.  This brand came highly recommended by someone in the tech.field.  Nothing negative to say.
236,"It took me 3-4 hours to get a new printer on my home network because of Windows 11 S. The folks at Canon were very helpful but ultimately I had to turn it over to Microsoft to setup Windows 11. Windows 11 S will only allow you to add Microsoft Apps and doesn't allow networking. I really like the Lenovo laptop but this should be a toggle to switch out of Safe mode. Microsoft prefers you use only their apps in order to avoid potential pitfalls with generic apps. Also this laptop does not have a CD/DVD Drive. I wanted to load my copy of Home and Business 2010 office but Microsoft no longer supports the app so I had to ""rent"" new Office at a initial cost of $70 a year. Screen quality is great and I really like the touch screen"
237,Got this laptop bcuz of windows 11 while unboxing it i realised it had windows 10 safe mode sigh.
238,Easy to setup and great design
239,"I really like it, I use it for online teaching.  It is great, the hdmi access is so much easier."
240,"So far I like it but as the headline states, it doesn't have windows 11 installed, only window 10 in safe mode.  Update: easily upgraded to Windows 11."
241,Clean lines and extremely functional. Very Happy with the speed and performance. I would recommend it for the daily user.
242,"Unfortunately,  I didn't need this item, but heard it was a great find. I was able to get my current laptop fixed"
243,The affordable prices....
244,Cheap maid. Did not like it for the money @!!
245,"I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!"
246,"This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop."
247,"A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as ""basic needs"" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to ""S Mode"" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?"
248,"A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend."
249,BUYER BE AWARE: This computer has Microsoft 10S. This is scam software by Microsoft to force you to use only Microsoft apps from their deserted island wasteland of an app store. The computer will not allow you to do anything else. You can upgrade to a full version of Microsoft 10... for another $134. Hard pass. STAY AWAY from ALL computers with Microsoft 10S!! Absolute garbage software.
250,"I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and ""safe."" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be."
251,It runs amazing
252,"*UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant ."
253,"The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5"" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5"" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an ""upgrade your edition of Windows"" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the ""Go to the Store"" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the ""helpful"" button! Thank you!"
254,"I bought this laptop for its weight and that's about the only thing positive I can say about it.The processing power is not very strong, so performance-wise, I was not impressed. But with the pricetag considered, I'm all right with this.However, the biggest thing for me is the OS- WINDOWS 10-IN S MODE.I had never heard of S Mode, and I didn't notice this when I bought the laptop.Apparently, S Mode is Microsoft's way of ensuring that you only use their apps and products by blocking you from downloading any outside apps. You have to get them all through their store. So, for example, were I to try to download Norton's anti-virus from Norton's official site, Microsoft's S Mode would tell me that I am unable. Any and all files outside of their store are blocked from being downloaded.In order to leave S Mode, you have to change it in the settings, but then you have to use a registration key for Windows 10 Home or Pro. So I shelled out another $130 just to get a fully functioning OS. Factor that price into this laptop price. THEN- after purchasing Windows 10 Home, I had to keep trying over the course of 4 days for the laptop to accept me switching out of S Mode because Microsoft was conveniently having server errors on their side and so my request could not be processed at this time. This is a common issue, at least from what I read among those discussing S Mode on Reddit forums. Multiple people report that Microsoft has server issues when you try to opt out of S Mode.Very very unhappy with this laptop for the sole reason that the OS is Windows 10 in S Mode. It was inconvenient and one of the most useless things I have ever seen pre-installed on a computer. Created a major and unnecessary headache for me."
255,"I was hesitant getting a Chromebook as I was concerned I'd miss being able to install windows programs, but so far I am really impressed with this. It was very quick to setup and easy to sync all of my Google account info. Having the ability to install Google apps is great. It's lightweight, runs fast, and seems to have a long lasting battery.As far as shipping it came packaged really well and the condition is 9/10 with only a slight smudge on the top of lid."
256,Did not come with a charger
257,5 months is all this piece of crap lasted! Conveniently past the 90 warranty window.  I called the 3rd party seller and had a mini argument about their company standing behind their products...  He told he that I would have to take this into a repair shop to have a new microphone and camera installed.  I told him that I knew that this would cost more than the laptop itself.  It said it would be around $40.  Well guess what the report shop said.  Exactly what I knew from the beninging...it would cost $300 plus the laptop would never function the same.  DO NOT BUY!!  Save yourself the waste of money....  buy new and not from a 3rd party seller
258,I have no cell phone to get instruction s - this is not a laptop  - the keys are different and I have no idea how to use this -  I can barely hear it -  it takes forever just to load facebook -  it constantly buffers -  I see why it was discounted  -  junk.
259,I have another chromebook but it has an 11 inch screen.  I was surprised that this one with a 14inch screen has better battery life.  Mostly I am browsing internet so I don't need all of the slowness and problems associated with Windows 10.
260,"Exactly as described. Havent tried the touch screen yet because I keep forgetting it's an option. The chromebook is definitely different then I'm used to, but it has been an easy transition."
261,"I need Bluetooth for some things.  This unit will not run Bluetooth without completely taking away all my bandwidth for wifi.  I get 12M down but fire up Bluetooth and I drop to 1m or less.  So tube videos are  impossible to watch.  Even listening to just music via BT although not as drastic will still cause the audio to stutter/stop and start.The next thing is the wifi range is not as good as all my devices...  50 ft and the transfer rate down is a 1/3rd down...  <>8M....  All my devices run above 11M...  So sadly I am returning the unit.The BT issue has been known about for quite a while.  I would not have thought there would be any problem with BT...My Mac, PC win 10 laptop runs BT just fine an there is absolutely no bandwidth traffic!I borrowed a friends older Lenovo chromebook and it demonstrates the same thing.  His wifi speed was good.Jim"
262,"So the laptop is very portable,  easy to use, and pretty fast. The problem is I bought this as a Christmas gift, so didn't open or test it when I got it. After opening it we found that the webcam doesn't work. We tried ever solution we could find online but nothing worked. I tried to contact the seller and they we next to useless just telling me to refresh it, then never replying again. So I ended up having to but another laptop for zoom meetings for school. If you can I'd at the very least avoid this seller."
263,14 inch is a great size if you want something medium size. Very light weight and easy to use. Usbc cord is great so all of the devices that I own use the same charger. I got this for under 200 and it was well worth it if you need something to type and simple web browsing. My only wish was that this was touch screen and I didn't realized I needed touch screen at the time...
264,DO NOT ORDER THIS!!! I ordered something this and got a lower grade of Chrome book(N22 which is worth less than half the price of the laptop in the display).
265,"I've only had it about a week, and it has been constant troubleshooting.  When it works, I like the keyboard, the display is crisp and it boots up fast and switches tasks quickly.  But things didn't (and some still don't) work out of the box, and there is too much spamware installed.The right click on the touchpad did not function out of the box.  I researched a bit, couldn't find a good solution, but after I did a BIOS update for a different problem it seems to work now, although with a fiddly two finger gesture instead of just one finger clicking in the bottom right like every other laptop I've got.  It is a dice roll whether it registers both fingers or not, so you might get the right click menu, you might just open links or jump to somewhere else in the program and then have to get back and try again.  I'm guessing I'd get used to this.You do get Windows pre-installed.  The license key is a bit hard to find in case you need/want to reinstall it, but you can find it in the BIOS.  It boots real fast, so it is tricky to get to the BIOS menu.  Windows also doesn't seem to actually shut down, so when you open up the lid, it is already past the BIOS prompt (with the default settings).  Microsoft requires a Microsoft account to even use the computer, which isn't Lenovo's fault, but annoying.  Lenovo comes with ""helpful"" admin tools to update firmware and the BIOS, but you have to set up a Lenovo account to do so.  That is a pain, and I exited out, only to see that I've got an email verifying my Lenovo account, apparently populating it with info from the Microsoft account that I just set up.  I don't want to be paranoid, but Microsoft had me set up an account and five minutes later my information is being used to set up other accounts.  Not a good look for either side - how am I supposed to trust anything I do on this laptop?But even worse is the Lenovo software is like continuously being asked about your car's extended warranty, warning you about all the bad things that will happen and upselling you on better support.  How many people are buying a $500 laptop and needing on-site replacement services?The biggest problem by far is that I still don't know what the USB-C port does.  I initially set it up using my docking station.  USB-C charging didn't work.  It didn't recognize a second display.  It did recognize the ethernet connection and mouse and keyboard.  Reading up, it looks like it is fiddly with exactly which docking stations it will talk to.  I'm currently leaving one job, starting another, and for . . . reasons . . . , I currently have 5 daily use laptops, all of which work flawlessly with a ""high end"" Dell docking station.  I also have a ton of cheap ones from the last year hooking up school Chromebooks to various monitors.  None of them work with this Lenovo.  It will recognize the second display if I plug in the HDMI cable directly.  I have also tried any number of adapters to plug into the USB-C port - from Chromebooks, from a MacBookPro, from a dedicated USB charging hub that far exceeds the power requirements - no luck.  It doesn't recognize any of them to charge.  It does have a second charging port with a dedicated, proprietary connector which works well enough, but the brick that plugs to the wall is large and the cord is short-ish and the charging port is on one side of the machine only, which limits where I can actually use it.Speaking of which, the battery is nowhere near the 8.5 hours advertised.  More like 4, with the settings out of the box.  That is enough for me, but I had 75% charge left, suspended the computer and closed the lid, and it was completely empty 6 hours later.  I'm not sure you could be doing anything less with the computer, and it still drained the battery pretty quickly.  I've played with disabling some BIOS settings but don't see a huge difference.  If I don't have it plugged in overnight, it is dead in the morning.Other than that, no problems :)  I actually like the computer when it is running, it is much better than the one I am replacing, performance-wise.  But things did not work out of the box, and having a half-baked USB-C port that doesn't charge is probably a deal breaker for me.  I'm waiting on another docking station that has been reported to work well with this laptop before throwing away the days of configuration and returning it.  Who knows, maybe I just got a bum USB port and it does work out of the box for everyone else."
266,"This is my second Lenovo and I wouldn't have bought another one if the first wasn't a gem. The touchscreen can be very handy if you aren't a touchpad user (which I'm not) and you don't have space to use a mouse (such as on a plane). The only drawback on this particular model is no backlit keyboard.  Otherwise,  I give it 5 stars."
267,"I'm delighted with my new computer.... The only issue is that the fingerprint sensor isn't working, but everything is cool and despite the computer is made from plastic, it feels very classy."
268,very good home type computer
269,"WiFi died and even a complete software reset would not fix it, clearly a hardware issue. I am having to not only pay this seller to return it they are going to charge me a 20% restocking fee because I threw the box away THE DAY BEFORE IT DIED!"
270,"According to the Yale School of Management, Lenovo continues to pursue business interests in the Russian Federation even though scores of other reputable companies have withdrawn from the country."
271,"I bought this laptop for scientific computing, and I was waiting for one with an 8-core processor for parallelized computations. When I saw a Ryzen 8-core processor, 32 GB RAM, and the price, ~$900 before tax, it ticked. This HP-Ryzen laptop exceeded my expectations in speed and energy efficiency. I ran a benchmark test of Wolfram Mathematica (the software I use for computations) and the results were far above all other computers listed there for comparison. At the same time, the laptop does not consume much energy, its power adapted is small. I run a parallelized computation using all 8 cores for hours and the laptop's body is only a little bit warm. I do not hear any sound of the fan. This is a huge step forward in comparison to my previous laptops with Intel i7 processors that consumed a lot of energy and were getting hot even in the idling regime.On the other hand, it is apparently not a gaming laptop as it has an AMD Radeon graphics card, no expensive Nvidia that I don't need. Comparable gaming laptops (8 cores) on Amazon cost twice as much.I haven't found any serious drawbacks yet. A small drawback is that the keyboard is not illuminated from within, the body of this laptop and its keys are gray, while inscriptions on the keys are not white but grayish. With low light, you don't see them well, and you cannot work at night without a light. The keyboard is much better visible on my preceding Dell Inspiron laptop (Intel i5, also energy efficient and overall good) that has a black surface and keys, white key inscriptions, and keyboard illumination."
272,"great update from my 10 yr old lenovo t430.it is light and super fast, sturdy built and i like the touch.setup was easy and upgraded to win 11 in no time. fabulous interface. like the new windows!very happy with the purcahse."
273,Overall performance of the laptop is good. I primarily bought it for educational purposes and it definitely meets my needs.
274,It never worked as it should it seemed to be reconditioned
275,"I use the laptop for PowerPoints, projection, Xcel, etc.  Utilize it on a network and it hooked right up and worked great.  Not a single complaint.  Love it!"
276,My people say it works great!
277,"Mic doesn't pick up well when speaker is off or at edge of camera, but it is faster than the Ryzen 5 I murdered, lighter weight, too. I thought I would miss my 17in screen, but 15in is okay since the resolution is good."
278,"This is a long review.  To summarize, you get what you pay for and then some.  This is a very usable package at a bargain price.  Nothing is top-of-the-line, but you will get a nice, compact machine for web-based activity.This is my first Chromebook.  Previously I have used Macs and laptops from Toshiba and Lenovo.  I decided to go with a Chromebook because I mostly email, browse pages, Zoom, and watch Youtube.  Anything I need to do document-wise can be covered by Google.  The compactness and long battery life is a big plus.  I'm tired of big, heavy laptops wearing holes in my bags.This Chromebook weighs 2-1/4 .lbs, which is excellent.  It is about the size of a magazine, so I would not hestitate to take it anywhere.  The body is plastic, which is durable and easy to keep clean.  It's not as nice as metal, but it is generally solid.  The bottom panel is a teeny bit loose, but that is a nitpick.Battery life is as advertised.  Depending what you do you get around 10 hours or more, which is more than double any laptop I have used.The screen opens to 135 degrees (or 45 degrees against the tabletop).  I was disappointed it did not open to a full 180, but I can work with it.  Screen brightness is listed at 220 nits (on the low end), but don't let that deter you; it is as bright as my 8 year old Macbook and my Lenovo laptop assigned by work. For indoor use, it works just fine.  If you work outside, you will have to find shade.  The display quality is not the best, but perfectly useable.  It is an IPS display, which provides better viewing angles and color rendition.  The 11.6"" screen is enough real estate for watching videos and reading the news.  I can type this review and read my email side by side.  This is also a touch screen, which seems to work fine in my limited experience.  When laying down with the Chromebook on my chest, it's nice to just browse using the touchscreen.  I have downloaded a few Android games, and they work great on the touchscreen.  IMO spend more for the touch screen if you want to use Android apps.The keyboard is a comfortable size.  I am typing efficiently without making lots of mistakes.  Most of the keys are where you expect them to be.  The specialized Chrome keys don't interfere.  The keys themselves have a nice, positive response.  Equally responsive is the trackpad, which comes with a full repertoire of gestures for scrolling, zooming, and viewing apps.  One thing I noticed is you can only physically click on the botton half of the touchpad, but I usually tap to click.The on-board speakers are a nice surprise.  They are loud and clear.  An audiophile might find them slightly tinny, but I can listen to music for hours using just these speakers.  There is minimal distortion when I crank the volume up to max. Of course, there is a headphone jack and bluetooth capability.32 gigs of memory may be challenged if you install a lot of apps.  The Chrome System takes up about 13 GB on its own. I have inserted a 128 GB Micro SD card, which can be used as storage for Android apps that support it.  For example, I can download music from Youtube Music to my SD card.  Documents from the Text editor and Camera app can be directed to the SD card as well.Regarding the processor, I don't do anything that has taxed this system yet.  I usually only have a couple of tabs and apps open, and I play a few games.  Keep in mind this is the same processor on the almost universally lauded Lenovo Duet Chromebook, so it is no slouch.The 720p webcam is adquate for web conferencing, taking snapshots or recording videos.  It's a little grainy with indoor lighting.  People seem to hear me fine using the internal microphone, but works best if you are sitting right in front of the computer.  The mic input can be adjusted if you expand the volume options in the wifi/battery/time options.One last cool thing is you can charge this Chromebook with a phone charger (with the right cable).  It is slow, and must be done while the Chromebook is not in use.  I was able to get 15% per hour using a basic phone charger.  It might be nice if you are traveling and don't need to lug around the clunky power supply that comes with this Chromebook.Overall, I am happy with my purchase. This is a nice value package that delivers."
279,"I first want to say that mechanically this laptop worked great. The company that sent it also sent it very fast, arriving ahead of the projected date. Now that positivity is out of the way, why am i returning it?Say what you want about me, but i didn't realize that this device used a different OS. I originally wanted an affordable laptop for some word processing. Chrome OS does not allow you to do this. Functionally it could,  but it designed to be an internet browser and little else. Do you have a phone? Well, your phone is capable of everything this device can do and more. Why would anyone need a laptop with less functionality than a phone?Many software programs support a variety of operating systems. They do not currently work with Chrome OS. You cannot even attempt to download them. I have heard that you can download apps (not that i was able to experience this for myself), but that will be the only downloading of programs that you might have access to.This now leads to my final gripe, the device is basically online only.A browser cannot function without internet, so it is with this device. It seems to be so dependent on this that it actually bugged out when i tried to delete the only wifi connection it had. (which reminds me, there is no way that you can factory reset this device. There is no option to do so, take that as you will.) When you first start up this device, it will force you to connect to the internet. You can skip putting in you Google account info, but it will not allow you to proceed without internet.Tldr: Don't get anything with Chrome OS. Your phone is capable of so much more than this ever will be."
280,"This is a great Chromebook for a middle to highschooler. It has a real long battery life charges quickly, and maintains a strong wireless signal. The touchscreen is very responsive and we haven’t had any problems with it at all. It has a very comfortable keyboard."
281,"I only use a computer for personal stuff, e-mails, facebook, random stuff., a zoom meeting once a week. I'm 72 and needed a lighter, smaller one than my dinosaur of a laptop. This fits the bill perfectly. It weighs less than the average book, it has a very long battery life, its size and weight makes it easily portable, and I can have it outside on the deck for hours without losing power. I love the touchscreen, and it was not hard converting to the Chrome OS from Windows. The only thing this didn't offer was a backlit keyboard, but since It's white, w/white keyboard, It's not hard to see even in dim light. So easy to use and carry, and easily contains everything my old computer had downloaded--and that's a lot!  I Love It!"
282,"It's very important to note, this is a Chromebook NOT a full-sized laptop, so this may be much smaller than expected.Personally, I love this Chromebook, size and all. It works great and has a pretty decent quality. No issues with so far with charging, battery life, crashing, etc. I would only hope for a better sound quality, as it doesn't get very loud at all. Plenty of storage space for me as well, as I use it for crafting (Design Space app, emails, saving photos, etc.) I would also recommend this for those looking for something small with a keyboard for school use."
283,"This is perfect for what I need. I  am a writer and have been writing on a kindle tablet, and it was just too small."
284,"I like the Chromebook, but it restarts itself every day on its own. I've had it for less than a month. I believe the MicroSD card slot is too close to the power cord slot. I leverage my thumb on the side of the Chromebook to pull the power cord out (the spot where the MicroSD card slot is) so I end up uninstalling the card. No, there's no other way to carefully remove the power cord. I've had several Chromebooks and never had issues until this one."
285,"I didn't realize how small it was however it's a nice laptop,the screen did go black for a full day, it was charged an everything,for some weird reason it came back on, that's the only issue I've had with it"
286,"Make sure you read the fine print. I received my chromebook. The package it was in was already opened. A little annoyed I paid for a new one and got a used one but it looked ok. Plug it in to start using it and check it out. Kept saying it was charging. Unplugged it the next day only for it to cut righty back off and say it was dead. I tried another chromebook charger and the same thing happened. So I decided to get some support. Amazon was nice but made me try all the things I already did. After nothing worked, again. They told me to contact the seller, there was nothing else they could do to help me. I reached out to the seller and got no reply. And apparently I can’t return it. For any reason whatsoever. So now I have a cr*p laptop that I just wasted $ on that I guess I’ll now have to pay to take somewhere to fix it. So annoyed and disappointed. I haven’t even had it a few days and can’t even return for a replacement or to get my money back. Cool cool cool. Thanks"
287,"If my labtop goes to sleep, when I try to use it from sleep the screen is split.  The botton half is on top and the top part is on the bottom.  And nothing can be done to fix this other than logging out and shutting down and restarting the computer. This becomes very annoying after a while.  Also, with regularity, the notebook simply freezes and again, the only remedy is to shut down and restart. A third regret is that it is very, very slow, much slower than the 5-year old Acer Chromebook (similar price) that I am trying to replace because it's nearing 5-years old and Chrome no longer supports my Acer Chromebook with security updates.  The HP Chromebook is such poor quality that I don't use it anymore, I'm back to using my 5-year old Acer Chromebook.  I have a few more months until it's no longer supported.  I think I will try the Pixelbook Go, it seems to have good reviews and I have much higher hopes for it.  I'm so disappointed with the HP that I will never, ever consider another HP product.  Such low, laughable quality."
288,I did not know that the Chromebook I purchased was ‘refurbished’ until I received it.  The price pd was for a new laptop. I feel cheated. I am not happy.
289,"Its a basic Chromebook.  Nothing fancy but does exactly what I need it to do.  Internet searching, emails and can stream  amazon video.  Going to experiment with Google Docs and slides also.  For the money...I think it was a great purchase."
290,"I was not sure I would like a Chromebook. Quick start up. Once you figure out how to work off line and navigate, it's not that different from other formats. You can easily add memory via a thumb drive or micro sd card. The only thing I can't do is a wireless connection to my printer.  Small inconvenience for the cost of the laptop. It is plenty fast for office apps and the internet with the battery lasting all day. Thumbs up."
291,"The  HP Chromebook is an excellent multi purpose laptop. It can be used for researching online, budgeting and finances, games, music and movies. Shopping for anything needed for the entire family.Taking classes on line or for homework for students."
292,"It looks new and is fast, has a long battery life, and is spot on what we needed.  Just a fast device that we can search the web on and project onto a television screen.  Lightweight so we can move it around easily and small so it tucks away when not in use.  Can't beat the price for this level of computer."
293,"The laptop was purchased renewed. Be careful who you purchase from. Mine was severely compromised and infected all of my androids. I suggest to thoroughly inspect it first and if something seems out of the norm, return item immediately. Such as logging in and out. Be safe and spend a few xtra dollars on a new one if you can. I wish I would of. Just a warning. I'm sure not all of the sellers are untrustworthy but the few that are? Beware."
294,We bought this product for my father in law as a gift.  He's a novice to say the least at technology and couldn't be more pleased with the product.  Company did a great job and it arrived two days after the purchase in a secure box and packaged to ensure no damage would take place.  I would definitely order from them again!
295,The laptop I received is not what I expected. This laptop does not want to turn on no matter what power adapter I use. The problem is with the computer itself. It's very inconvenient and incredibly disappointing.
296,was delivered with a user id still on it.  renewed?  No one even looked at it.  Total BS
297,This computer does NOT have a backlit keyboard as advertised in the product description.
298,"My only gripe is the screen itself. Has a backlight sheen, so you have the have the right angle to see colors correctly. Had to download a second party program to change gamma and brightness, but it looks better now.Has SD slot, and my first Windows 11 computer. Everything installs and works properly. A backlit keyboard would be nice, but I knew it didn’t have one when I bought it."
299,"I just got this computer today and my first impression is: it's loud. The keys are not clicky but sort of hollow sounding, which isn't too bad. The fans turn on and off constantly and WEEEESHHHHHHHH for minutes at a time (all I've done so far is load Chrome). The worst thing for me is the touchpad makes a sound like you're dragging your finger over bad paper from grade-school chapter books. I'm autistic (and admittedly have a headache right now ((there go the fans for no reason))) and I'm extremely sensitive to noises and this fffsffssffsfsfsfsfssssssss sound is super irritating. My old HP had a nice smooth touchpad that literally made NO NOISE, why oh why would they change it? I'm already trying to duck the noise my own fingers are making, or using my other hand to cover it up to deaden the noise. I'll end up using this with headphones in a lot, which will make my husband sad...Still sitting here with the fans going, and they actually cover up the noise of the touchpad... That's not a solution.I'm sure I'll be back with more to say but this was my immediate unhappy impressionnext day update: WHY DIDN'T ANYONE MENTION THAT ####### ### ###### ######## ###### LIGHT ON THE F6 KEY ????? It comes on when you push mute,,,,which, I ALWAYS have my computer on mute. I realise I could just turn down the volume but I want to push the mute button. And now when I do, this annoying orange light comes on that's a tiny sun in a dark room, very distracting. I hate it and now have put .99 cent nail polish on my 750$ machine.FEW DAYS LATER: the nail polish is holding up, but using this thing with only WoW running on it (that's it, that's all that on it) it's like being on the moores on a windy night. Just WEeeEEEEEEEeSHHHSEeWWEEEEEEEEESssshEEEEEEEWEEEEEEEHHHHHWWSSSSSS constantly from the processors, it's high pitched and incessant.The arrow keys are weird shaped and too small (for laptop gaming purposes) but at least the entire spacebar and touchpad work which is more than I could say for the Dell I had."
300,"I was skeptical when I ordered this because there was not a model included in the description. But I have never had an issue returning anything I have ordered through Amazon in the past so I decided to go for it.Yes, it is an HP laptop! It is actually an hp laptop model 15-ef2127wm . I ordered the one with 32GB RAM and 1 TB SSD drive. I wanted something with similar specs to my desktop pc. I have been extremely pleased with the performance!I tried to take a picture since the product information is on the bottom of the laptop. However, the font is extremely small and the black on gray isn't the best contrast so the image tends to be blurry. If I could change one thing about it I would have the keyboard backlit. I like that the cooling vent is on the top between the screen and the keyboard. I tend to play City of Heroes Homecoming for hours on end. I changed my graphics settings for the appearance over performance and this laptop never seemed to get hot even after 8 hours of gaming!I am not into VR gaming so you might check with HP on that. it will upgrade to Windows 11. I personally have not done this because my desktop pcs are not compatible and I like to have everything on the same operating system."
301,"I've been looking for a new laptop.  This is the third one I've bought, and I'll probably end up keeping it against my better judgement just because I'm tired of looking.  My main issue is that the product listing says this is a new 2022 model.  And it comes with UDB-C data only.  None of my docking stations work with it at all.  It doesn't send video.  No charging.  It doesn't recognize etherrnet.  It doesn't recognize a mouse or keyboard or anything besides a USB storage device.  Yes, you can use the HDMI port on the laptop and that works fine.  And it has two USB A ports for a keyboard and mouse and you can hope you don't need anything else.  And you can pray you don't lose or damage the charger, because it is of course non-standard.  I move between my desk and other areas enough that plugging and unplugging all of the peripherals multiple times a day is not a good thing.This isn't the highest end laptop, but for the price missing this functionality makes no sense.  My $150 chromebooks have had this for years, as have all of my work laptops from a variety of manufacturers.You might ask why I'm on my third laptop and why I still keep making this error?  The product copy of this on Amazon doesn't mention it either way.  But, I had other questions, and found the model on other websites and the HP website, and those indicated a docking station was supported.  The previous one I returned to Amazon because it specifically said it had support and didn't.  The first one I returned somewhere else, because I saw USB-C and charging/monitors have been supported for so long, I just assumed this would work, plus one of the pictures talked about USB-C and had a picture of multiple monitors but had photoshopped all the wires out and they said after the picture was showing using the HDMI port on the laptop.This is also the reason I'm keeping it.  I look around at other similarly priced or slightly higher ones, and it is really difficult to tell if returning yet another one will make a difference - I guess I'll have to go see them in person to tell for sure.  Now, if I wanted a Chromebook, I know I could get one at 1/3 the price that supports this, but I really need a functional SSH client and X-Windows display.All of that said, the laptop is functional enough.  Fast to boot, quick to compile code, fast switching between programs, good display, above average battery life.  If only they'd tossed in a $5 part to have a real port."
302,"Nice computer, fast, good screen, but just stopped working after 3+ weeks of light use. You can turn it off, but the hard-drive continues running in the background and you cannot turn it on again for days! Fully charged, maybe you are in luck to turn it on -but- on most days you are OUT OF LUCK! Will return for credit! Used the Amazon Return policy within the allotted time period, printed the return label and returned item with extra packaging ($21) to the seller via UPS. Item was returned to seller on 2/6/2022 confirmed by UPS tracking and I am still waiting for a full refund by seller / Amazon."
303,"I wanted 16 GB of RAM and SSD hard drive but didn't need a ton of space.  Some of the complaints I have read are valid.  The USB-C port does not support video.  Hard to find anywhere in the description but if that's a deal breaker for you look for USB-C Thunderbolt.  There is an actual Thunderbolt beside the USB-C port.  I almost returned the unit because of the keyboard.  Although I didn't care if it was back lit (it's not), the contrast between the letters and key is not good.  I could not see the symbols in low light.  I bought a silicon keyboard cover for about 8 bucks from the Big A and now can easily see and I am more protected from spills.  For casual users this is a great unit.  It's light and I like the screen size and the 10 digit pad built in.  You want 3 screens and a ton of ports, better dig deeper into your wallet."
304,"This laptop was not advertised as having a touchscreen and does not have one, and is the reason for not rating a touchscreen.This laptop was for my grandson to have for school work and the on-line games he likes to participate in. He loves it and from what I have seen the laptop is very responsive and will work for him through school. Additional software is needed for word processing, etc. The only thing I did not like is, when opening and turning on the laptop it immediately goes into a setup and is a not pre-installed with Windows 11 OS, with only your personal preferences and connectivity to setup. I will update this review if to the contrary in a couple of months from now. So far, I do not expect to have to do an update."
305,"Well it worked for about 3 days before it had fatal OS issues, I have been in contact with HP since then and have ran the hardware tests a half dozen time and had to install windows 10 in order to get back to having an OS, but now the laptop cannot find a network... ""update"" returned laptop after wasting days trying to get it fixed, but hey there's a 72$ restocking fee for a garbage laptop so that's always nice."
306,It is bowed in the middle and twangs when I type.  Computer is fast and screen is good.  Is this a genuine HP laptop?
307,"I love everything about this HP laptop the quality, the screen, and battery life; everything is excellent! A good investment for doing university classes. Also, suitable for work/professional purposes as well."
308,"With only minor signs of use and a first boot fatal error that required a rescue usb, after around 2 weeks of use I must say that this is the right minimum specs for a daily office work without issues. 64gb allows to install some linux apps to work, battery arrived with 96% of health in diagnosis. I don't think you can't get better specs these days for the price. Recommended"
309,"Received in perfect condition, no sign of prior use. Chrome OS loaded normally and was updated to latest edition without issues. International delivery was surprisingly fast."
310,The battery life wasn't good and came with a scratch on top.
311,"Very well built and with an elegant design. Good processor, very fast. Quiet fan operation, cool keeping in palm rest area.I was surprised by the fact that it came with an ""HDD Kit"" (connectors), to expand the storage capacity with an internal HDD disk (I asked Asus and they replied that a HDD or SSD of up to 1 TB can be installed, to expand the capacity storage).Asus customer service is very good (it comes with MyAsus software that makes communication very easy); is one reason I bought this brand. Two years ago I bought an Asus 13 ""Notebook, I had a software problem with the keyboard lighting and in a few messages they guided me on how to solve it, until now I have never had problems again.I sincerely recommend this Notebook."
312,"Light weight, great start up speed with SSD drive.  Keyboard backlighting good for dim lights but key letters hard to see in medium light.  Ability to turn off keyboard backlighting is a plus and actually makes letters easier to see in bright light."
313,"I've been using my new ASUS VivoBook computer for over a week and have a few comments.  First, it's a great computer for those folks who like to work in the dark.  The contrast between the silver keys and the lighted characters is poor at best.  Key F7 allows four settings for the brightness of the characters, but the brightest one is still too dim. I find it easy to see the keyboard if I work in a dimmed setting.  I've owned two ASUS computers previously and both have had excellent keyboard contrast. Why did they change to a poor contrast keyboard? Without this fault I would give it a 5 star rating.This is sold as a portable computer.  At five pounds it might be better described as transportable.This computer does NOT have a touch screen as is advertised by Amazon. This is a good screen if you don't like looking at finger prints.Going to ASUS for help sends you to a ""paid-for"" tech group. This is a helluva way to provide support and ASUS should be ashamed!"
314,"Great laptop; very fast processor (i7), good RAM memory and nice solid state drive; there is no Touch Screen so don't know why Amazon wanted a rating on it; there are 2 issues:  support is only by email (almost useless for computers) and although it says it will support 2 monitors, it will ONLY if you close the laptop's lid; video card only supports a ""TOTAL"" of 2 monitors so don't plan on using the laptop's screen if you intend to use 2 external monitors - lid must be closed for it to display on both external monitors"
315,"Bought for my husband after his other asus only lasted 18mths. I was skeptical to say the least, but this was what he wanted. Aside from the volume being horrible, it appears to be working just fine. We’re only 2mths into it so I’m still very cautious."
316,"In the market for a new laptop?  I've found this unit to be exceptional, compared to my older Dell Latitude.  Speed, and the 17-inch screen feels good on my aging eyes."
317,Very happy so far--only drawback is that the speakers on this laptop don't get very loud....
318,"This laptop is a solid, well-built device with speed, great display, and a good keyboard.  The only downside I see is the audio quality.  Not as good as I had hoped."
319,
320,"Very nice laptop the screen is the right size, the only downside I have is the keys can be hard to see at times"
321,"This one has a super fast boot up time. The only issue I have so far is that the Capslock button had a light that worked when you clicked on it (so you know when it's enabled) but now it does not light up. The computer it self is pretty good. After doing so extensive research, this one was the ""worth it"" laptop that I needed. Good for school work and office work. Comes in ""windows S mode"" but its easy to switch out to a regular mode. All you need to do is install Chrome and google will tell you exactly what you need to do to switch out of the ""S"" mode. Screen quality isn't HD but you really won't notice the difference. I would have given a five star rating if it wasn't for the capslock issue. I wish they made this with a white color design.Update-  Some vibrations and crack in sound but still working good."
322,"Very disappointed, this was advertised as touch screen then on the description it says non touch screen and it’s much smaller than described. Very disappointed."
323,We mainly use this Computer for zoom meetings and work so it works perfectly for emails and things like that nothing special for us
324,"I bought this laptop because I really don't need anything fancy AT ALL! It was just supposed to be for my kids when they needed to do homework, and for me to use to search a few things on the internet and check my email.... THATS IT! It was RIDICULOUS! I seriously timed it just to prove my point, and from the time I turned it on to the time it was ready to actually use it took 15 MINUTES!! Now I am not one of these young kids who think if things don't happen in a blink of an eye, it is slow and I get mad. I grew up with dial up and so I am used to sitting and waiting on a computer. But this was worse than that. It would never fully load, when I typed on it, it wouldn't keep up, and it was always just turning off. Then to turn it back on, well that was quite the process that sometimes wouldn't happen that day. I am not techy in the least, I just want a computer to turn on, let me search a few things, and let my kids search a few things. I didn't think I asked that much. This computer didn't agree with me. So if you have the patience of JOB, this laptop just may be for you. If not, don't waste your time."
325,"This is my first Dell and I’ve called customer service twice for minor issues and they really go the extra mile, I’ve never experienced such great customer service before. Before purchasing my Dell laptop, I read about their renowned customer service and now I know it’s the real deal. My only complaint is the lackluster black generic case, miss having a shiny case; otherwise superb product."
326,"This laptop was a Christmas gift for my wife.  It powered up and the setup was done without issue.  We used it for a day, doing web-based apps and even watched some YouTube videos with no issues.  We used it again a couple of days later, but the performance was very poor.  Screens would hang and freeze for extending periods.  It was unusable.  We powered down and closed the device.  We were out of town and returned home a week later.  It powered up and was useable for a little while (an hour or two), then again became slow.  When typing a word, each letter would take several seconds to complete.  It was extremely frustrating and disappointing so we have returned it."
327,"Out of the box it was slow to start up and even slower to open any app. I spent days researching how to speed it up and still failed to get it to work. Issue others have with this model is for some reason, even with 16GB or more of Ram, it still has high CPU and high Disk use ongoing. Even when not doing anything. Activity monitor show this clearly. Worst part was I could not fix after a week(am pretty PC knowledgable), I contacted Dell and they finally concluded it must be a software issue and not hardware so I would have to pay them $99 to have tech help fix.Very let down since my first PC ever was a Dell XPS series that was awesome and lasted me 6 years.  It's a brand new PC and I have to pay to fix it. I thought he was joking. So I sent it back and ordered Macbook Pro."
328,"Computer was ordered with both SSD and HDD drives. The operating system was installed on the SSD while the HDD was unformatted and could not be seen by Windows 10. I am glad I was savvy enough to use utilities to see if the HDD was indeed installed, otherwise I would have had to return to the vendor and pay the return shipping fees (UPS would have been $34). If I had sent this to my wife or other family members, they sure would have returned the computer for not having the purchased second drive (HDD)."
329,"My new job as a department head for a city means I need to work almost anywhere on any given day - my office, a conference room, a public event, out in the Industrial Park or out of town. I have used this laptop for 60 days now in my car, my office, at the fire department, out in the desert at a solar farm and in three different cities. It just works everywhere and every time I need it. It connects instantly to my office wifi and my portable cellular signal hotspot every single time.The touchscreen is responsive and easy to use in tablet form or as a regular laptop. The ability to convert to a tablet has been immensely useful on the go for me - I bought the companion pen/stylus separately to add property line markers and such on satellite photos out in the field. I fold the computer and go into tablet mode seamlessly as needed. The overall processing speed is more than enough and I haven't experienced any lag at all even with multiple files, programs and functions going at once. It runs Microsoft Office and additional photo editing software and other stuff without any drama.I drag this laptop around in a padded case in a tote bag with various files I need for the day and it's light enough that I don't feel like I'm carrying an extra 10lbs of nonsense after a 10 hour day. My only real complaint is that the fingerprint reader is not always easy to use or fully functional. I have actually just quit messing with it entirely and instead use a 6 digit pin number to unlock the computer. It's been a dream for Zoom connections both in my office and on the go with the wifi hotpot only. I'm very glad I chose this laptop instead of the Surface or something different."
330,This laptop was the best deal of Christmas 2020!! It's an amazing price for everything that comes with it! My 13 yo son uses it primarily for gaming and has only good things to say. Buy this!! You won't be disappointed!
331,"The last laptop I bought - a Lenovo - had an optical drive. So nearly a decade old. But it was a total workhorse for work and home use. And needed replacement.After *lots* of reading and research I landed on the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro, in no small no part because my Samsung Galaxy 10+ phone has done so well.Also? This was in stock! Several others I looked at were either out when I started looking, or went to backorder while I was on the hunt. And the Amazon 5-payment plan was a little kinder on my budget.Screen is incredible. Backlit keyboard. RAM is nearly triple what my old machine had (16gb v 6), so using Photoshop now is no big deal while I'm using several other apps simultaneously. It sure used to be. And it takes about a second - yep - once you flip the screen open to wake.Downside? It's *very* thin and *very* light compared to my old machine, so that's taken some getting used to. I need to hold it in place while I open the screen. And right now it actually sits ON the old one when I'm working. But it's still new yet.Looks like it's a bit more expensive now ( I paid about $1100) but I think still a deal for what you'll be getting, esp if you haven't upgraded in a while as was my case.Highly recommend."
332,Super fast laptop.The screen is beautiful. I love the light weight.Nice packing.Best laptop I've ever won.The sould quality is amazing for this thin laptop. (You will have to go to the sound setting and press the advance speaker quality to activate the best sound possible)
333,This it's totally defected. I'm sending it tomorrow through UPS back to Amazon due to the fact that it will not charge. Stops at 44% and doesn't go on and it should charge in 30 minutes from what the information States. I am totally disappointed. There was no adapter in it either.
334,"Llevo unas semanas con mi Samsung Galaxy Book Pro y estoy más que feliz con ella, porque es súper rápida, sensible y con una calidad de imagen en la pantalla super espectacular ¡Lo mejor de lo mejor! Y más siendo a ese precio."
335,I absolutely hated windows 11 it's garbage and cost me down time trying to navigate is bs os
336,"Having laptops provided by employer for several years, I hadn’t purchased in a while. Usually I think budget, but this time I splurged a bit and I am very happy.Super lightweight and very fast startup and waking. AMZN also providing good link for MS 365 Office"
337,The laptop came with a faulty boot system and I had to install the Windows 11 from scratch to get it work. The laptop was unable to repair itself. It's actually a used one from the Amazon warehouse buy at least they should have warned that it might be defective.
338,Great Sound! Easily the finest laptop audio you can ask for at this price. Screen flickering at lowering brightness and does not look sharp enough for Full HD resolution. AMOLED colors are great as usual. battery life is decent.
339,Super fast machine. Fantastic screen resolution and color rendition. Lots of memory for manipulating big data files. Can't find anything to complain about. Writing code to do financial analysis on large Account Receivable files. The speed is amazing.
340,"Great device, really like it. Lightweight, fast, quiet, long battery life. Best notebook I had ever!The only disadvantage found by now - camera quality is quite poor.Even my 5 years old macbook has better camera."
341,"Just like that title says ... Nice Upgrade from my old Alienware-18 Gaming Laptop but the sound ABSOLUTELY SUCKS!. I had to buy a set of external speakers to go with it. It sounded like someone stuffed a pillow into the speakers, it is very muffled and beyond far too (fake-sounding) bassy."
342,We are very satisfied with this computer.  It has been several years since we purchased a lap top.  So far--this has been very good to work with.  It is so much faster.  This brand came highly recommended by someone in the tech.field.  Nothing negative to say.
343,"It took me 3-4 hours to get a new printer on my home network because of Windows 11 S. The folks at Canon were very helpful but ultimately I had to turn it over to Microsoft to setup Windows 11. Windows 11 S will only allow you to add Microsoft Apps and doesn't allow networking. I really like the Lenovo laptop but this should be a toggle to switch out of Safe mode. Microsoft prefers you use only their apps in order to avoid potential pitfalls with generic apps. Also this laptop does not have a CD/DVD Drive. I wanted to load my copy of Home and Business 2010 office but Microsoft no longer supports the app so I had to ""rent"" new Office at a initial cost of $70 a year. Screen quality is great and I really like the touch screen"
344,Got this laptop bcuz of windows 11 while unboxing it i realised it had windows 10 safe mode sigh.
345,Easy to setup and great design
346,"I really like it, I use it for online teaching.  It is great, the hdmi access is so much easier."
347,"So far I like it but as the headline states, it doesn't have windows 11 installed, only window 10 in safe mode.  Update: easily upgraded to Windows 11."
348,Clean lines and extremely functional. Very Happy with the speed and performance. I would recommend it for the daily user.
349,"Unfortunately,  I didn't need this item, but heard it was a great find. I was able to get my current laptop fixed"
350,The affordable prices....
351,Cheap maid. Did not like it for the money @!!
352,"I had a lot of hope switching from HP to Microsoft.  I thought that getting the top of the line laptop would be faster and have longer battery life.First off the packaging feels a bit flimsy and less durable.  It's definitely lighter from the HP 360 spectre I had, but it comes at a cost.My HP spectre was 10 years old intel i7, 512 gb SSD and 8 gb of ram and was running great, but after 10 years I thought I could use an upgrade.  After setting it up I noticed that it seemed a tick slower even with 24 gb of ram.  So I tested it and found out that the HP fired up faster to the home screen by 20 secs faster!I thought I can live with that if the battery lasted longer.  Guess what?  It doesn't.  I tested it from 100% that I get about 3.75 hours of battery before I have to plug it in.  That seems crazy off of what is stated!  After 10 years my HP matches the battery life.With that said, if you're going to buy a surface for speed and battery life try the AMD processor.  I would still feel a bit skeptical to be honest.I'm truly disappointed."
353,"The Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 15"" model is certainly an excellent laptop and an extremely credible alternative to other premium Windows-based laptops, AND MacBook Pros. My current workhorse is the 2019 16"" MacBook Pro, so let's compare the two here, despite there certainly being a price difference.1.) The aluminum chassis is stunning. It's incredibly minimalist. If you think Apple is minimalist with its MacBook line, Microsoft takes it to the next level. A solid mass of black (in this reviewer’s case), and ice cold to the touch.2.) Really lightweight at 3.4lbs, compared to 4.3lbs on the MacBook Pro 16. 2496 x 1664 (201ppi), - though not as good as on the MacBook Pro 16, (3072x1920, 226ppi), - still looks the part. Colors are not as vibrant as the MacBook Pro, only covering 75% DCI-P3 compared to 99% on the MacBook Pro, and the difference is really, really obvious. The display is certainly good, but in 2021 this isn't close to flagship. Throw in a pretty mediocre max screen brightness (380 cd/m2), this isn't great. The MacBook Pro 16"" will hit about 500cd/m2, and the difference side my side is staggering. It is a touch-screen, mind, but I’m still not convinced a touchscreen on a non-convertible laptop has tangible benefit to most users.The auto-brightness setup is very “jagged,” not a smooth fading up or down in brightness, - and I just turned this feature off as I found it very distracting.3.) The trackpad is responsive, though it’s pretty small compared to the MacBook. While I prefer the nice, physical trackpad click on the Surface, the MacBook’s trackpad allows you to “click” anywhere.4.) Port selection is really, really poor here. A single USB Type-A, a single USB Type-C, a headphone jack, and the Surface proprietary charging connector (something that really seems incredibly pointless, especially in 2021). No Thunderbolt ports of any sort here, which is a major oversight. Thankfully you can charge via the USB Type-C port so you don’t have to use the Surface proprietary port if you don’t want to.As an aside, setup of the Surface Laptop 4 is easy. Turn on, run through some initial setup, and you’re done pretty quickly. Bloatware is kept to a complete minimum, and I only found myself removing Microsoft 365 and a few other extraneous apps.5.) The keyboard is good. It’s not the best, a little spongier than the MacBook Pro 16’s, with a slower rebound, but still among the “good” keyboards on the market, - reasonably tactile. It has physical F-keys, something I wish I had on the MacBook Pro 16. I think the TouchBar is one of the worst things to happen to MacBooks (inadvertent touches are the worst!), so I hope Apple reverts to physical keys this coming year on their flagship system. Rumor has it they will.6.) Ergonomics are decent, though it’s actually a bit tricky to open the laptop as there’s no indent where you’re meant to flip the screen up, - a peculiar oversight. Bezels are a little large for 2021, but far from offensive.7.) Sound quality is not bad, but a far cry from the bass that the MacBook Pro 16 is able to generate. You could certainly listen to music here, but headphones would be preferred.8.) Battery life and thermals are absolutely fantastic, decimating the MacBook Pro for general usage, which is just a portable toaster. The laptop just runs remarkably cool with this AMD setup. That said, when the fans kick in, they kick in with a WHOOSH, which can be a bit disconcerting. Battery life is superb, easily giving me 8-11 hours for general web usage, a good 40% longer than my MacBook Pro doing the exact same things at a comparable brightness.  9.) The SSD is nothing too special. While yes, any SSD is faster than not-an-SSD, this is on the lower end of the spectrum in terms of NVMe performance.Overall, I really enjoy the Surface Laptop 4, but it’s not hard to see where Microsoft could make some massive improvements and solidify the Surface line as THE Windows 10 systems to buy.4 out of 5. A worthy alternative to high-end laptops, but not yet at the top of its game."
354,I've been using and HP laptop for a few years now and it has become a bit sluggish.  The Surface Laptop 4 is lighting fast in comparison.  The graphics are great for what I do and I can't complain really.
355,"I'm buying Surface Laptops almost every year because my sister and girlfriend are ""borrowing"" these laptops from me and never return them :D . The keyboard and the overall feelings are soooo good that no one wants to stop using these machines. And the 4th generation with AMD Ryzen processor is great for battery life, I was using Intel versions Laptop 2 and Laptop 3, and they are powerful, but Ryzen is very energy efficient and I can just charge the laptop before going to the office and I can work on it whole day and also I can watch a movie before I will need to charge the Laptop, it's great."
356,Doesn't have a SD CARD READER! A COUPLE OF MONTHS  IN and it's already crapping out! I cannot recommend this
357,"Purchased for our grandson on starting college in August. It was an immediate hit for him. Plus Microsoft protected it with exceptional packing, This saved the laptop from being destroyed by the careless packing by the shipper. Every corner of the Microsoft box was dented or crushed. There was no protective badding at all to stop the laptop box from banging around in the flimsy shipper box. What an outstanding job Microsoft. Fire your shipper. This company should be punished!"
358,"Sad that upgrading memory is not a option.Included SSD does need replaced with a butter won.I have nerve damage and some surfaces of laptops hurt my fingers way more than others,this has been the most kind to me so far."
359,This is my third Surface and I’m really pleased. The first lasted me 5 years and I loved it. The second I took from my son after he left for college and got a new computer that suited his needs more. But because he kind of abused it it didn’t last long. So far I’m loving this one! The battery life is solid but like any laptop watch too many videos or use too much processing power and the battery life goes down. The touch screen is much improved over previous models. The one downside for my needs is no slot for a SD or mini SD card. There’s only one USB port and one USB C port so you really need a hub.
360,I'm homebound for ~6 months with 2 broken ankles; the sporadic function of the Chromebook I had was driving me nuts trying to get anything done or keep myself entertained while stuck at home.  Bought the Surface after my positive experiences with the one I am supplied with for work and now I am able to get stuff done all day without freeze-ups and rebooting every 12-24 hours.  And the configuration options available were mind blowing...it took a bit to decide what it was I actually needed on the unit verses the cost of paying for ALL the options.
361,"This laptop is great! The 15 inch touch screen made teaching on my surface pro feel like I was using a toy BUT it keeps freezing mid class. On my first day of class it froze after a few hours and I could not even Ctrl-Alt-Delete. So i just switched to my pro to finish the class. When I went back to it everything seemed fine so I persisted. On day two it froze within the first hour. I closed the lid and re-opened it and it froze 15 mins later and I was done. Maybe I received a faulty mechine. I will buy it again, because of how much I love it, unless Macs start including touchscreens."
362,"I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!"
363,"This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop."
364,"A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as ""basic needs"" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to ""S Mode"" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?"
365,"A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend."
366,BUYER BE AWARE: This computer has Microsoft 10S. This is scam software by Microsoft to force you to use only Microsoft apps from their deserted island wasteland of an app store. The computer will not allow you to do anything else. You can upgrade to a full version of Microsoft 10... for another $134. Hard pass. STAY AWAY from ALL computers with Microsoft 10S!! Absolute garbage software.
367,"I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and ""safe."" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be."
368,It runs amazing
369,"*UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant ."
370,"The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5"" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5"" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an ""upgrade your edition of Windows"" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the ""Go to the Store"" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the ""helpful"" button! Thank you!"
371,"I bought this laptop for its weight and that's about the only thing positive I can say about it.The processing power is not very strong, so performance-wise, I was not impressed. But with the pricetag considered, I'm all right with this.However, the biggest thing for me is the OS- WINDOWS 10-IN S MODE.I had never heard of S Mode, and I didn't notice this when I bought the laptop.Apparently, S Mode is Microsoft's way of ensuring that you only use their apps and products by blocking you from downloading any outside apps. You have to get them all through their store. So, for example, were I to try to download Norton's anti-virus from Norton's official site, Microsoft's S Mode would tell me that I am unable. Any and all files outside of their store are blocked from being downloaded.In order to leave S Mode, you have to change it in the settings, but then you have to use a registration key for Windows 10 Home or Pro. So I shelled out another $130 just to get a fully functioning OS. Factor that price into this laptop price. THEN- after purchasing Windows 10 Home, I had to keep trying over the course of 4 days for the laptop to accept me switching out of S Mode because Microsoft was conveniently having server errors on their side and so my request could not be processed at this time. This is a common issue, at least from what I read among those discussing S Mode on Reddit forums. Multiple people report that Microsoft has server issues when you try to opt out of S Mode.Very very unhappy with this laptop for the sole reason that the OS is Windows 10 in S Mode. It was inconvenient and one of the most useless things I have ever seen pre-installed on a computer. Created a major and unnecessary headache for me."
372,"I was hesitant getting a Chromebook as I was concerned I'd miss being able to install windows programs, but so far I am really impressed with this. It was very quick to setup and easy to sync all of my Google account info. Having the ability to install Google apps is great. It's lightweight, runs fast, and seems to have a long lasting battery.As far as shipping it came packaged really well and the condition is 9/10 with only a slight smudge on the top of lid."
373,Did not come with a charger
374,5 months is all this piece of crap lasted! Conveniently past the 90 warranty window.  I called the 3rd party seller and had a mini argument about their company standing behind their products...  He told he that I would have to take this into a repair shop to have a new microphone and camera installed.  I told him that I knew that this would cost more than the laptop itself.  It said it would be around $40.  Well guess what the report shop said.  Exactly what I knew from the beninging...it would cost $300 plus the laptop would never function the same.  DO NOT BUY!!  Save yourself the waste of money....  buy new and not from a 3rd party seller
375,I have no cell phone to get instruction s - this is not a laptop  - the keys are different and I have no idea how to use this -  I can barely hear it -  it takes forever just to load facebook -  it constantly buffers -  I see why it was discounted  -  junk.
376,I have another chromebook but it has an 11 inch screen.  I was surprised that this one with a 14inch screen has better battery life.  Mostly I am browsing internet so I don't need all of the slowness and problems associated with Windows 10.
377,"Exactly as described. Havent tried the touch screen yet because I keep forgetting it's an option. The chromebook is definitely different then I'm used to, but it has been an easy transition."
378,"I need Bluetooth for some things.  This unit will not run Bluetooth without completely taking away all my bandwidth for wifi.  I get 12M down but fire up Bluetooth and I drop to 1m or less.  So tube videos are  impossible to watch.  Even listening to just music via BT although not as drastic will still cause the audio to stutter/stop and start.The next thing is the wifi range is not as good as all my devices...  50 ft and the transfer rate down is a 1/3rd down...  <>8M....  All my devices run above 11M...  So sadly I am returning the unit.The BT issue has been known about for quite a while.  I would not have thought there would be any problem with BT...My Mac, PC win 10 laptop runs BT just fine an there is absolutely no bandwidth traffic!I borrowed a friends older Lenovo chromebook and it demonstrates the same thing.  His wifi speed was good.Jim"
379,"So the laptop is very portable,  easy to use, and pretty fast. The problem is I bought this as a Christmas gift, so didn't open or test it when I got it. After opening it we found that the webcam doesn't work. We tried ever solution we could find online but nothing worked. I tried to contact the seller and they we next to useless just telling me to refresh it, then never replying again. So I ended up having to but another laptop for zoom meetings for school. If you can I'd at the very least avoid this seller."
380,14 inch is a great size if you want something medium size. Very light weight and easy to use. Usbc cord is great so all of the devices that I own use the same charger. I got this for under 200 and it was well worth it if you need something to type and simple web browsing. My only wish was that this was touch screen and I didn't realized I needed touch screen at the time...
381,DO NOT ORDER THIS!!! I ordered something this and got a lower grade of Chrome book(N22 which is worth less than half the price of the laptop in the display).
382,"I've only had it about a week, and it has been constant troubleshooting.  When it works, I like the keyboard, the display is crisp and it boots up fast and switches tasks quickly.  But things didn't (and some still don't) work out of the box, and there is too much spamware installed.The right click on the touchpad did not function out of the box.  I researched a bit, couldn't find a good solution, but after I did a BIOS update for a different problem it seems to work now, although with a fiddly two finger gesture instead of just one finger clicking in the bottom right like every other laptop I've got.  It is a dice roll whether it registers both fingers or not, so you might get the right click menu, you might just open links or jump to somewhere else in the program and then have to get back and try again.  I'm guessing I'd get used to this.You do get Windows pre-installed.  The license key is a bit hard to find in case you need/want to reinstall it, but you can find it in the BIOS.  It boots real fast, so it is tricky to get to the BIOS menu.  Windows also doesn't seem to actually shut down, so when you open up the lid, it is already past the BIOS prompt (with the default settings).  Microsoft requires a Microsoft account to even use the computer, which isn't Lenovo's fault, but annoying.  Lenovo comes with ""helpful"" admin tools to update firmware and the BIOS, but you have to set up a Lenovo account to do so.  That is a pain, and I exited out, only to see that I've got an email verifying my Lenovo account, apparently populating it with info from the Microsoft account that I just set up.  I don't want to be paranoid, but Microsoft had me set up an account and five minutes later my information is being used to set up other accounts.  Not a good look for either side - how am I supposed to trust anything I do on this laptop?But even worse is the Lenovo software is like continuously being asked about your car's extended warranty, warning you about all the bad things that will happen and upselling you on better support.  How many people are buying a $500 laptop and needing on-site replacement services?The biggest problem by far is that I still don't know what the USB-C port does.  I initially set it up using my docking station.  USB-C charging didn't work.  It didn't recognize a second display.  It did recognize the ethernet connection and mouse and keyboard.  Reading up, it looks like it is fiddly with exactly which docking stations it will talk to.  I'm currently leaving one job, starting another, and for . . . reasons . . . , I currently have 5 daily use laptops, all of which work flawlessly with a ""high end"" Dell docking station.  I also have a ton of cheap ones from the last year hooking up school Chromebooks to various monitors.  None of them work with this Lenovo.  It will recognize the second display if I plug in the HDMI cable directly.  I have also tried any number of adapters to plug into the USB-C port - from Chromebooks, from a MacBookPro, from a dedicated USB charging hub that far exceeds the power requirements - no luck.  It doesn't recognize any of them to charge.  It does have a second charging port with a dedicated, proprietary connector which works well enough, but the brick that plugs to the wall is large and the cord is short-ish and the charging port is on one side of the machine only, which limits where I can actually use it.Speaking of which, the battery is nowhere near the 8.5 hours advertised.  More like 4, with the settings out of the box.  That is enough for me, but I had 75% charge left, suspended the computer and closed the lid, and it was completely empty 6 hours later.  I'm not sure you could be doing anything less with the computer, and it still drained the battery pretty quickly.  I've played with disabling some BIOS settings but don't see a huge difference.  If I don't have it plugged in overnight, it is dead in the morning.Other than that, no problems :)  I actually like the computer when it is running, it is much better than the one I am replacing, performance-wise.  But things did not work out of the box, and having a half-baked USB-C port that doesn't charge is probably a deal breaker for me.  I'm waiting on another docking station that has been reported to work well with this laptop before throwing away the days of configuration and returning it.  Who knows, maybe I just got a bum USB port and it does work out of the box for everyone else."
383,"This is my second Lenovo and I wouldn't have bought another one if the first wasn't a gem. The touchscreen can be very handy if you aren't a touchpad user (which I'm not) and you don't have space to use a mouse (such as on a plane). The only drawback on this particular model is no backlit keyboard.  Otherwise,  I give it 5 stars."
384,"I'm delighted with my new computer.... The only issue is that the fingerprint sensor isn't working, but everything is cool and despite the computer is made from plastic, it feels very classy."
385,very good home type computer
386,"WiFi died and even a complete software reset would not fix it, clearly a hardware issue. I am having to not only pay this seller to return it they are going to charge me a 20% restocking fee because I threw the box away THE DAY BEFORE IT DIED!"
387,"According to the Yale School of Management, Lenovo continues to pursue business interests in the Russian Federation even though scores of other reputable companies have withdrawn from the country."
388,"I bought this laptop for scientific computing, and I was waiting for one with an 8-core processor for parallelized computations. When I saw a Ryzen 8-core processor, 32 GB RAM, and the price, ~$900 before tax, it ticked. This HP-Ryzen laptop exceeded my expectations in speed and energy efficiency. I ran a benchmark test of Wolfram Mathematica (the software I use for computations) and the results were far above all other computers listed there for comparison. At the same time, the laptop does not consume much energy, its power adapted is small. I run a parallelized computation using all 8 cores for hours and the laptop's body is only a little bit warm. I do not hear any sound of the fan. This is a huge step forward in comparison to my previous laptops with Intel i7 processors that consumed a lot of energy and were getting hot even in the idling regime.On the other hand, it is apparently not a gaming laptop as it has an AMD Radeon graphics card, no expensive Nvidia that I don't need. Comparable gaming laptops (8 cores) on Amazon cost twice as much.I haven't found any serious drawbacks yet. A small drawback is that the keyboard is not illuminated from within, the body of this laptop and its keys are gray, while inscriptions on the keys are not white but grayish. With low light, you don't see them well, and you cannot work at night without a light. The keyboard is much better visible on my preceding Dell Inspiron laptop (Intel i5, also energy efficient and overall good) that has a black surface and keys, white key inscriptions, and keyboard illumination."
389,"great update from my 10 yr old lenovo t430.it is light and super fast, sturdy built and i like the touch.setup was easy and upgraded to win 11 in no time. fabulous interface. like the new windows!very happy with the purcahse."
390,Overall performance of the laptop is good. I primarily bought it for educational purposes and it definitely meets my needs.
391,It never worked as it should it seemed to be reconditioned
392,"I use the laptop for PowerPoints, projection, Xcel, etc.  Utilize it on a network and it hooked right up and worked great.  Not a single complaint.  Love it!"
393,My people say it works great!
394,"Mic doesn't pick up well when speaker is off or at edge of camera, but it is faster than the Ryzen 5 I murdered, lighter weight, too. I thought I would miss my 17in screen, but 15in is okay since the resolution is good."
395,"This is a long review.  To summarize, you get what you pay for and then some.  This is a very usable package at a bargain price.  Nothing is top-of-the-line, but you will get a nice, compact machine for web-based activity.This is my first Chromebook.  Previously I have used Macs and laptops from Toshiba and Lenovo.  I decided to go with a Chromebook because I mostly email, browse pages, Zoom, and watch Youtube.  Anything I need to do document-wise can be covered by Google.  The compactness and long battery life is a big plus.  I'm tired of big, heavy laptops wearing holes in my bags.This Chromebook weighs 2-1/4 .lbs, which is excellent.  It is about the size of a magazine, so I would not hestitate to take it anywhere.  The body is plastic, which is durable and easy to keep clean.  It's not as nice as metal, but it is generally solid.  The bottom panel is a teeny bit loose, but that is a nitpick.Battery life is as advertised.  Depending what you do you get around 10 hours or more, which is more than double any laptop I have used.The screen opens to 135 degrees (or 45 degrees against the tabletop).  I was disappointed it did not open to a full 180, but I can work with it.  Screen brightness is listed at 220 nits (on the low end), but don't let that deter you; it is as bright as my 8 year old Macbook and my Lenovo laptop assigned by work. For indoor use, it works just fine.  If you work outside, you will have to find shade.  The display quality is not the best, but perfectly useable.  It is an IPS display, which provides better viewing angles and color rendition.  The 11.6"" screen is enough real estate for watching videos and reading the news.  I can type this review and read my email side by side.  This is also a touch screen, which seems to work fine in my limited experience.  When laying down with the Chromebook on my chest, it's nice to just browse using the touchscreen.  I have downloaded a few Android games, and they work great on the touchscreen.  IMO spend more for the touch screen if you want to use Android apps.The keyboard is a comfortable size.  I am typing efficiently without making lots of mistakes.  Most of the keys are where you expect them to be.  The specialized Chrome keys don't interfere.  The keys themselves have a nice, positive response.  Equally responsive is the trackpad, which comes with a full repertoire of gestures for scrolling, zooming, and viewing apps.  One thing I noticed is you can only physically click on the botton half of the touchpad, but I usually tap to click.The on-board speakers are a nice surprise.  They are loud and clear.  An audiophile might find them slightly tinny, but I can listen to music for hours using just these speakers.  There is minimal distortion when I crank the volume up to max. Of course, there is a headphone jack and bluetooth capability.32 gigs of memory may be challenged if you install a lot of apps.  The Chrome System takes up about 13 GB on its own. I have inserted a 128 GB Micro SD card, which can be used as storage for Android apps that support it.  For example, I can download music from Youtube Music to my SD card.  Documents from the Text editor and Camera app can be directed to the SD card as well.Regarding the processor, I don't do anything that has taxed this system yet.  I usually only have a couple of tabs and apps open, and I play a few games.  Keep in mind this is the same processor on the almost universally lauded Lenovo Duet Chromebook, so it is no slouch.The 720p webcam is adquate for web conferencing, taking snapshots or recording videos.  It's a little grainy with indoor lighting.  People seem to hear me fine using the internal microphone, but works best if you are sitting right in front of the computer.  The mic input can be adjusted if you expand the volume options in the wifi/battery/time options.One last cool thing is you can charge this Chromebook with a phone charger (with the right cable).  It is slow, and must be done while the Chromebook is not in use.  I was able to get 15% per hour using a basic phone charger.  It might be nice if you are traveling and don't need to lug around the clunky power supply that comes with this Chromebook.Overall, I am happy with my purchase. This is a nice value package that delivers."
396,"I first want to say that mechanically this laptop worked great. The company that sent it also sent it very fast, arriving ahead of the projected date. Now that positivity is out of the way, why am i returning it?Say what you want about me, but i didn't realize that this device used a different OS. I originally wanted an affordable laptop for some word processing. Chrome OS does not allow you to do this. Functionally it could,  but it designed to be an internet browser and little else. Do you have a phone? Well, your phone is capable of everything this device can do and more. Why would anyone need a laptop with less functionality than a phone?Many software programs support a variety of operating systems. They do not currently work with Chrome OS. You cannot even attempt to download them. I have heard that you can download apps (not that i was able to experience this for myself), but that will be the only downloading of programs that you might have access to.This now leads to my final gripe, the device is basically online only.A browser cannot function without internet, so it is with this device. It seems to be so dependent on this that it actually bugged out when i tried to delete the only wifi connection it had. (which reminds me, there is no way that you can factory reset this device. There is no option to do so, take that as you will.) When you first start up this device, it will force you to connect to the internet. You can skip putting in you Google account info, but it will not allow you to proceed without internet.Tldr: Don't get anything with Chrome OS. Your phone is capable of so much more than this ever will be."
397,"This is a great Chromebook for a middle to highschooler. It has a real long battery life charges quickly, and maintains a strong wireless signal. The touchscreen is very responsive and we haven’t had any problems with it at all. It has a very comfortable keyboard."
398,"I only use a computer for personal stuff, e-mails, facebook, random stuff., a zoom meeting once a week. I'm 72 and needed a lighter, smaller one than my dinosaur of a laptop. This fits the bill perfectly. It weighs less than the average book, it has a very long battery life, its size and weight makes it easily portable, and I can have it outside on the deck for hours without losing power. I love the touchscreen, and it was not hard converting to the Chrome OS from Windows. The only thing this didn't offer was a backlit keyboard, but since It's white, w/white keyboard, It's not hard to see even in dim light. So easy to use and carry, and easily contains everything my old computer had downloaded--and that's a lot!  I Love It!"
399,"It's very important to note, this is a Chromebook NOT a full-sized laptop, so this may be much smaller than expected.Personally, I love this Chromebook, size and all. It works great and has a pretty decent quality. No issues with so far with charging, battery life, crashing, etc. I would only hope for a better sound quality, as it doesn't get very loud at all. Plenty of storage space for me as well, as I use it for crafting (Design Space app, emails, saving photos, etc.) I would also recommend this for those looking for something small with a keyboard for school use."
400,"This is perfect for what I need. I  am a writer and have been writing on a kindle tablet, and it was just too small."
401,"I like the Chromebook, but it restarts itself every day on its own. I've had it for less than a month. I believe the MicroSD card slot is too close to the power cord slot. I leverage my thumb on the side of the Chromebook to pull the power cord out (the spot where the MicroSD card slot is) so I end up uninstalling the card. No, there's no other way to carefully remove the power cord. I've had several Chromebooks and never had issues until this one."
402,"I didn't realize how small it was however it's a nice laptop,the screen did go black for a full day, it was charged an everything,for some weird reason it came back on, that's the only issue I've had with it"
403,"Make sure you read the fine print. I received my chromebook. The package it was in was already opened. A little annoyed I paid for a new one and got a used one but it looked ok. Plug it in to start using it and check it out. Kept saying it was charging. Unplugged it the next day only for it to cut righty back off and say it was dead. I tried another chromebook charger and the same thing happened. So I decided to get some support. Amazon was nice but made me try all the things I already did. After nothing worked, again. They told me to contact the seller, there was nothing else they could do to help me. I reached out to the seller and got no reply. And apparently I can’t return it. For any reason whatsoever. So now I have a cr*p laptop that I just wasted $ on that I guess I’ll now have to pay to take somewhere to fix it. So annoyed and disappointed. I haven’t even had it a few days and can’t even return for a replacement or to get my money back. Cool cool cool. Thanks"
404,"If my labtop goes to sleep, when I try to use it from sleep the screen is split.  The botton half is on top and the top part is on the bottom.  And nothing can be done to fix this other than logging out and shutting down and restarting the computer. This becomes very annoying after a while.  Also, with regularity, the notebook simply freezes and again, the only remedy is to shut down and restart. A third regret is that it is very, very slow, much slower than the 5-year old Acer Chromebook (similar price) that I am trying to replace because it's nearing 5-years old and Chrome no longer supports my Acer Chromebook with security updates.  The HP Chromebook is such poor quality that I don't use it anymore, I'm back to using my 5-year old Acer Chromebook.  I have a few more months until it's no longer supported.  I think I will try the Pixelbook Go, it seems to have good reviews and I have much higher hopes for it.  I'm so disappointed with the HP that I will never, ever consider another HP product.  Such low, laughable quality."
405,I did not know that the Chromebook I purchased was ‘refurbished’ until I received it.  The price pd was for a new laptop. I feel cheated. I am not happy.
406,"Its a basic Chromebook.  Nothing fancy but does exactly what I need it to do.  Internet searching, emails and can stream  amazon video.  Going to experiment with Google Docs and slides also.  For the money...I think it was a great purchase."
407,"I was not sure I would like a Chromebook. Quick start up. Once you figure out how to work off line and navigate, it's not that different from other formats. You can easily add memory via a thumb drive or micro sd card. The only thing I can't do is a wireless connection to my printer.  Small inconvenience for the cost of the laptop. It is plenty fast for office apps and the internet with the battery lasting all day. Thumbs up."
408,"The  HP Chromebook is an excellent multi purpose laptop. It can be used for researching online, budgeting and finances, games, music and movies. Shopping for anything needed for the entire family.Taking classes on line or for homework for students."
409,"It looks new and is fast, has a long battery life, and is spot on what we needed.  Just a fast device that we can search the web on and project onto a television screen.  Lightweight so we can move it around easily and small so it tucks away when not in use.  Can't beat the price for this level of computer."
410,"The laptop was purchased renewed. Be careful who you purchase from. Mine was severely compromised and infected all of my androids. I suggest to thoroughly inspect it first and if something seems out of the norm, return item immediately. Such as logging in and out. Be safe and spend a few xtra dollars on a new one if you can. I wish I would of. Just a warning. I'm sure not all of the sellers are untrustworthy but the few that are? Beware."
411,We bought this product for my father in law as a gift.  He's a novice to say the least at technology and couldn't be more pleased with the product.  Company did a great job and it arrived two days after the purchase in a secure box and packaged to ensure no damage would take place.  I would definitely order from them again!
412,The laptop I received is not what I expected. This laptop does not want to turn on no matter what power adapter I use. The problem is with the computer itself. It's very inconvenient and incredibly disappointing.
413,was delivered with a user id still on it.  renewed?  No one even looked at it.  Total BS
414,This computer does NOT have a backlit keyboard as advertised in the product description.
415,"My only gripe is the screen itself. Has a backlight sheen, so you have the have the right angle to see colors correctly. Had to download a second party program to change gamma and brightness, but it looks better now.Has SD slot, and my first Windows 11 computer. Everything installs and works properly. A backlit keyboard would be nice, but I knew it didn’t have one when I bought it."
416,"I just got this computer today and my first impression is: it's loud. The keys are not clicky but sort of hollow sounding, which isn't too bad. The fans turn on and off constantly and WEEEESHHHHHHHH for minutes at a time (all I've done so far is load Chrome). The worst thing for me is the touchpad makes a sound like you're dragging your finger over bad paper from grade-school chapter books. I'm autistic (and admittedly have a headache right now ((there go the fans for no reason))) and I'm extremely sensitive to noises and this fffsffssffsfsfsfsfssssssss sound is super irritating. My old HP had a nice smooth touchpad that literally made NO NOISE, why oh why would they change it? I'm already trying to duck the noise my own fingers are making, or using my other hand to cover it up to deaden the noise. I'll end up using this with headphones in a lot, which will make my husband sad...Still sitting here with the fans going, and they actually cover up the noise of the touchpad... That's not a solution.I'm sure I'll be back with more to say but this was my immediate unhappy impressionnext day update: WHY DIDN'T ANYONE MENTION THAT ####### ### ###### ######## ###### LIGHT ON THE F6 KEY ????? It comes on when you push mute,,,,which, I ALWAYS have my computer on mute. I realise I could just turn down the volume but I want to push the mute button. And now when I do, this annoying orange light comes on that's a tiny sun in a dark room, very distracting. I hate it and now have put .99 cent nail polish on my 750$ machine.FEW DAYS LATER: the nail polish is holding up, but using this thing with only WoW running on it (that's it, that's all that on it) it's like being on the moores on a windy night. Just WEeeEEEEEEEeSHHHSEeWWEEEEEEEEESssshEEEEEEEWEEEEEEEHHHHHWWSSSSSS constantly from the processors, it's high pitched and incessant.The arrow keys are weird shaped and too small (for laptop gaming purposes) but at least the entire spacebar and touchpad work which is more than I could say for the Dell I had."
417,"I was skeptical when I ordered this because there was not a model included in the description. But I have never had an issue returning anything I have ordered through Amazon in the past so I decided to go for it.Yes, it is an HP laptop! It is actually an hp laptop model 15-ef2127wm . I ordered the one with 32GB RAM and 1 TB SSD drive. I wanted something with similar specs to my desktop pc. I have been extremely pleased with the performance!I tried to take a picture since the product information is on the bottom of the laptop. However, the font is extremely small and the black on gray isn't the best contrast so the image tends to be blurry. If I could change one thing about it I would have the keyboard backlit. I like that the cooling vent is on the top between the screen and the keyboard. I tend to play City of Heroes Homecoming for hours on end. I changed my graphics settings for the appearance over performance and this laptop never seemed to get hot even after 8 hours of gaming!I am not into VR gaming so you might check with HP on that. it will upgrade to Windows 11. I personally have not done this because my desktop pcs are not compatible and I like to have everything on the same operating system."
418,"I've been looking for a new laptop.  This is the third one I've bought, and I'll probably end up keeping it against my better judgement just because I'm tired of looking.  My main issue is that the product listing says this is a new 2022 model.  And it comes with UDB-C data only.  None of my docking stations work with it at all.  It doesn't send video.  No charging.  It doesn't recognize etherrnet.  It doesn't recognize a mouse or keyboard or anything besides a USB storage device.  Yes, you can use the HDMI port on the laptop and that works fine.  And it has two USB A ports for a keyboard and mouse and you can hope you don't need anything else.  And you can pray you don't lose or damage the charger, because it is of course non-standard.  I move between my desk and other areas enough that plugging and unplugging all of the peripherals multiple times a day is not a good thing.This isn't the highest end laptop, but for the price missing this functionality makes no sense.  My $150 chromebooks have had this for years, as have all of my work laptops from a variety of manufacturers.You might ask why I'm on my third laptop and why I still keep making this error?  The product copy of this on Amazon doesn't mention it either way.  But, I had other questions, and found the model on other websites and the HP website, and those indicated a docking station was supported.  The previous one I returned to Amazon because it specifically said it had support and didn't.  The first one I returned somewhere else, because I saw USB-C and charging/monitors have been supported for so long, I just assumed this would work, plus one of the pictures talked about USB-C and had a picture of multiple monitors but had photoshopped all the wires out and they said after the picture was showing using the HDMI port on the laptop.This is also the reason I'm keeping it.  I look around at other similarly priced or slightly higher ones, and it is really difficult to tell if returning yet another one will make a difference - I guess I'll have to go see them in person to tell for sure.  Now, if I wanted a Chromebook, I know I could get one at 1/3 the price that supports this, but I really need a functional SSH client and X-Windows display.All of that said, the laptop is functional enough.  Fast to boot, quick to compile code, fast switching between programs, good display, above average battery life.  If only they'd tossed in a $5 part to have a real port."
419,"Nice computer, fast, good screen, but just stopped working after 3+ weeks of light use. You can turn it off, but the hard-drive continues running in the background and you cannot turn it on again for days! Fully charged, maybe you are in luck to turn it on -but- on most days you are OUT OF LUCK! Will return for credit! Used the Amazon Return policy within the allotted time period, printed the return label and returned item with extra packaging ($21) to the seller via UPS. Item was returned to seller on 2/6/2022 confirmed by UPS tracking and I am still waiting for a full refund by seller / Amazon."
420,"I wanted 16 GB of RAM and SSD hard drive but didn't need a ton of space.  Some of the complaints I have read are valid.  The USB-C port does not support video.  Hard to find anywhere in the description but if that's a deal breaker for you look for USB-C Thunderbolt.  There is an actual Thunderbolt beside the USB-C port.  I almost returned the unit because of the keyboard.  Although I didn't care if it was back lit (it's not), the contrast between the letters and key is not good.  I could not see the symbols in low light.  I bought a silicon keyboard cover for about 8 bucks from the Big A and now can easily see and I am more protected from spills.  For casual users this is a great unit.  It's light and I like the screen size and the 10 digit pad built in.  You want 3 screens and a ton of ports, better dig deeper into your wallet."
421,"This laptop was not advertised as having a touchscreen and does not have one, and is the reason for not rating a touchscreen.This laptop was for my grandson to have for school work and the on-line games he likes to participate in. He loves it and from what I have seen the laptop is very responsive and will work for him through school. Additional software is needed for word processing, etc. The only thing I did not like is, when opening and turning on the laptop it immediately goes into a setup and is a not pre-installed with Windows 11 OS, with only your personal preferences and connectivity to setup. I will update this review if to the contrary in a couple of months from now. So far, I do not expect to have to do an update."
422,"Well it worked for about 3 days before it had fatal OS issues, I have been in contact with HP since then and have ran the hardware tests a half dozen time and had to install windows 10 in order to get back to having an OS, but now the laptop cannot find a network... ""update"" returned laptop after wasting days trying to get it fixed, but hey there's a 72$ restocking fee for a garbage laptop so that's always nice."
423,It is bowed in the middle and twangs when I type.  Computer is fast and screen is good.  Is this a genuine HP laptop?
424,"I love everything about this HP laptop the quality, the screen, and battery life; everything is excellent! A good investment for doing university classes. Also, suitable for work/professional purposes as well."
425,"With only minor signs of use and a first boot fatal error that required a rescue usb, after around 2 weeks of use I must say that this is the right minimum specs for a daily office work without issues. 64gb allows to install some linux apps to work, battery arrived with 96% of health in diagnosis. I don't think you can't get better specs these days for the price. Recommended"
426,"Received in perfect condition, no sign of prior use. Chrome OS loaded normally and was updated to latest edition without issues. International delivery was surprisingly fast."
427,The battery life wasn't good and came with a scratch on top.
428,"Very well built and with an elegant design. Good processor, very fast. Quiet fan operation, cool keeping in palm rest area.I was surprised by the fact that it came with an ""HDD Kit"" (connectors), to expand the storage capacity with an internal HDD disk (I asked Asus and they replied that a HDD or SSD of up to 1 TB can be installed, to expand the capacity storage).Asus customer service is very good (it comes with MyAsus software that makes communication very easy); is one reason I bought this brand. Two years ago I bought an Asus 13 ""Notebook, I had a software problem with the keyboard lighting and in a few messages they guided me on how to solve it, until now I have never had problems again.I sincerely recommend this Notebook."
429,"Light weight, great start up speed with SSD drive.  Keyboard backlighting good for dim lights but key letters hard to see in medium light.  Ability to turn off keyboard backlighting is a plus and actually makes letters easier to see in bright light."
430,"I've been using my new ASUS VivoBook computer for over a week and have a few comments.  First, it's a great computer for those folks who like to work in the dark.  The contrast between the silver keys and the lighted characters is poor at best.  Key F7 allows four settings for the brightness of the characters, but the brightest one is still too dim. I find it easy to see the keyboard if I work in a dimmed setting.  I've owned two ASUS computers previously and both have had excellent keyboard contrast. Why did they change to a poor contrast keyboard? Without this fault I would give it a 5 star rating.This is sold as a portable computer.  At five pounds it might be better described as transportable.This computer does NOT have a touch screen as is advertised by Amazon. This is a good screen if you don't like looking at finger prints.Going to ASUS for help sends you to a ""paid-for"" tech group. This is a helluva way to provide support and ASUS should be ashamed!"
431,"Great laptop; very fast processor (i7), good RAM memory and nice solid state drive; there is no Touch Screen so don't know why Amazon wanted a rating on it; there are 2 issues:  support is only by email (almost useless for computers) and although it says it will support 2 monitors, it will ONLY if you close the laptop's lid; video card only supports a ""TOTAL"" of 2 monitors so don't plan on using the laptop's screen if you intend to use 2 external monitors - lid must be closed for it to display on both external monitors"
432,"Bought for my husband after his other asus only lasted 18mths. I was skeptical to say the least, but this was what he wanted. Aside from the volume being horrible, it appears to be working just fine. We’re only 2mths into it so I’m still very cautious."
433,"In the market for a new laptop?  I've found this unit to be exceptional, compared to my older Dell Latitude.  Speed, and the 17-inch screen feels good on my aging eyes."
434,Very happy so far--only drawback is that the speakers on this laptop don't get very loud....
435,"This laptop is a solid, well-built device with speed, great display, and a good keyboard.  The only downside I see is the audio quality.  Not as good as I had hoped."
436,
437,"Very nice laptop the screen is the right size, the only downside I have is the keys can be hard to see at times"
438,"This one has a super fast boot up time. The only issue I have so far is that the Capslock button had a light that worked when you clicked on it (so you know when it's enabled) but now it does not light up. The computer it self is pretty good. After doing so extensive research, this one was the ""worth it"" laptop that I needed. Good for school work and office work. Comes in ""windows S mode"" but its easy to switch out to a regular mode. All you need to do is install Chrome and google will tell you exactly what you need to do to switch out of the ""S"" mode. Screen quality isn't HD but you really won't notice the difference. I would have given a five star rating if it wasn't for the capslock issue. I wish they made this with a white color design.Update-  Some vibrations and crack in sound but still working good."
439,"Very disappointed, this was advertised as touch screen then on the description it says non touch screen and it’s much smaller than described. Very disappointed."
440,We mainly use this Computer for zoom meetings and work so it works perfectly for emails and things like that nothing special for us
441,"I bought this laptop because I really don't need anything fancy AT ALL! It was just supposed to be for my kids when they needed to do homework, and for me to use to search a few things on the internet and check my email.... THATS IT! It was RIDICULOUS! I seriously timed it just to prove my point, and from the time I turned it on to the time it was ready to actually use it took 15 MINUTES!! Now I am not one of these young kids who think if things don't happen in a blink of an eye, it is slow and I get mad. I grew up with dial up and so I am used to sitting and waiting on a computer. But this was worse than that. It would never fully load, when I typed on it, it wouldn't keep up, and it was always just turning off. Then to turn it back on, well that was quite the process that sometimes wouldn't happen that day. I am not techy in the least, I just want a computer to turn on, let me search a few things, and let my kids search a few things. I didn't think I asked that much. This computer didn't agree with me. So if you have the patience of JOB, this laptop just may be for you. If not, don't waste your time."
442,"This is my first Dell and I’ve called customer service twice for minor issues and they really go the extra mile, I’ve never experienced such great customer service before. Before purchasing my Dell laptop, I read about their renowned customer service and now I know it’s the real deal. My only complaint is the lackluster black generic case, miss having a shiny case; otherwise superb product."
443,"This laptop was a Christmas gift for my wife.  It powered up and the setup was done without issue.  We used it for a day, doing web-based apps and even watched some YouTube videos with no issues.  We used it again a couple of days later, but the performance was very poor.  Screens would hang and freeze for extending periods.  It was unusable.  We powered down and closed the device.  We were out of town and returned home a week later.  It powered up and was useable for a little while (an hour or two), then again became slow.  When typing a word, each letter would take several seconds to complete.  It was extremely frustrating and disappointing so we have returned it."
444,"Out of the box it was slow to start up and even slower to open any app. I spent days researching how to speed it up and still failed to get it to work. Issue others have with this model is for some reason, even with 16GB or more of Ram, it still has high CPU and high Disk use ongoing. Even when not doing anything. Activity monitor show this clearly. Worst part was I could not fix after a week(am pretty PC knowledgable), I contacted Dell and they finally concluded it must be a software issue and not hardware so I would have to pay them $99 to have tech help fix.Very let down since my first PC ever was a Dell XPS series that was awesome and lasted me 6 years.  It's a brand new PC and I have to pay to fix it. I thought he was joking. So I sent it back and ordered Macbook Pro."
445,"Computer was ordered with both SSD and HDD drives. The operating system was installed on the SSD while the HDD was unformatted and could not be seen by Windows 10. I am glad I was savvy enough to use utilities to see if the HDD was indeed installed, otherwise I would have had to return to the vendor and pay the return shipping fees (UPS would have been $34). If I had sent this to my wife or other family members, they sure would have returned the computer for not having the purchased second drive (HDD)."
446,"My new job as a department head for a city means I need to work almost anywhere on any given day - my office, a conference room, a public event, out in the Industrial Park or out of town. I have used this laptop for 60 days now in my car, my office, at the fire department, out in the desert at a solar farm and in three different cities. It just works everywhere and every time I need it. It connects instantly to my office wifi and my portable cellular signal hotspot every single time.The touchscreen is responsive and easy to use in tablet form or as a regular laptop. The ability to convert to a tablet has been immensely useful on the go for me - I bought the companion pen/stylus separately to add property line markers and such on satellite photos out in the field. I fold the computer and go into tablet mode seamlessly as needed. The overall processing speed is more than enough and I haven't experienced any lag at all even with multiple files, programs and functions going at once. It runs Microsoft Office and additional photo editing software and other stuff without any drama.I drag this laptop around in a padded case in a tote bag with various files I need for the day and it's light enough that I don't feel like I'm carrying an extra 10lbs of nonsense after a 10 hour day. My only real complaint is that the fingerprint reader is not always easy to use or fully functional. I have actually just quit messing with it entirely and instead use a 6 digit pin number to unlock the computer. It's been a dream for Zoom connections both in my office and on the go with the wifi hotpot only. I'm very glad I chose this laptop instead of the Surface or something different."
447,This laptop was the best deal of Christmas 2020!! It's an amazing price for everything that comes with it! My 13 yo son uses it primarily for gaming and has only good things to say. Buy this!! You won't be disappointed!
448,"The last laptop I bought - a Lenovo - had an optical drive. So nearly a decade old. But it was a total workhorse for work and home use. And needed replacement.After *lots* of reading and research I landed on the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro, in no small no part because my Samsung Galaxy 10+ phone has done so well.Also? This was in stock! Several others I looked at were either out when I started looking, or went to backorder while I was on the hunt. And the Amazon 5-payment plan was a little kinder on my budget.Screen is incredible. Backlit keyboard. RAM is nearly triple what my old machine had (16gb v 6), so using Photoshop now is no big deal while I'm using several other apps simultaneously. It sure used to be. And it takes about a second - yep - once you flip the screen open to wake.Downside? It's *very* thin and *very* light compared to my old machine, so that's taken some getting used to. I need to hold it in place while I open the screen. And right now it actually sits ON the old one when I'm working. But it's still new yet.Looks like it's a bit more expensive now ( I paid about $1100) but I think still a deal for what you'll be getting, esp if you haven't upgraded in a while as was my case.Highly recommend."
449,Super fast laptop.The screen is beautiful. I love the light weight.Nice packing.Best laptop I've ever won.The sould quality is amazing for this thin laptop. (You will have to go to the sound setting and press the advance speaker quality to activate the best sound possible)
450,This it's totally defected. I'm sending it tomorrow through UPS back to Amazon due to the fact that it will not charge. Stops at 44% and doesn't go on and it should charge in 30 minutes from what the information States. I am totally disappointed. There was no adapter in it either.
451,"Llevo unas semanas con mi Samsung Galaxy Book Pro y estoy más que feliz con ella, porque es súper rápida, sensible y con una calidad de imagen en la pantalla super espectacular ¡Lo mejor de lo mejor! Y más siendo a ese precio."
452,I absolutely hated windows 11 it's garbage and cost me down time trying to navigate is bs os
453,"Having laptops provided by employer for several years, I hadn’t purchased in a while. Usually I think budget, but this time I splurged a bit and I am very happy.Super lightweight and very fast startup and waking. AMZN also providing good link for MS 365 Office"
454,The laptop came with a faulty boot system and I had to install the Windows 11 from scratch to get it work. The laptop was unable to repair itself. It's actually a used one from the Amazon warehouse buy at least they should have warned that it might be defective.
455,Great Sound! Easily the finest laptop audio you can ask for at this price. Screen flickering at lowering brightness and does not look sharp enough for Full HD resolution. AMOLED colors are great as usual. battery life is decent.
456,Super fast machine. Fantastic screen resolution and color rendition. Lots of memory for manipulating big data files. Can't find anything to complain about. Writing code to do financial analysis on large Account Receivable files. The speed is amazing.
457,"Great device, really like it. Lightweight, fast, quiet, long battery life. Best notebook I had ever!The only disadvantage found by now - camera quality is quite poor.Even my 5 years old macbook has better camera."
458,"Just like that title says ... Nice Upgrade from my old Alienware-18 Gaming Laptop but the sound ABSOLUTELY SUCKS!. I had to buy a set of external speakers to go with it. It sounded like someone stuffed a pillow into the speakers, it is very muffled and beyond far too (fake-sounding) bassy."
459,We are very satisfied with this computer.  It has been several years since we purchased a lap top.  So far--this has been very good to work with.  It is so much faster.  This brand came highly recommended by someone in the tech.field.  Nothing negative to say.
460,"It took me 3-4 hours to get a new printer on my home network because of Windows 11 S. The folks at Canon were very helpful but ultimately I had to turn it over to Microsoft to setup Windows 11. Windows 11 S will only allow you to add Microsoft Apps and doesn't allow networking. I really like the Lenovo laptop but this should be a toggle to switch out of Safe mode. Microsoft prefers you use only their apps in order to avoid potential pitfalls with generic apps. Also this laptop does not have a CD/DVD Drive. I wanted to load my copy of Home and Business 2010 office but Microsoft no longer supports the app so I had to ""rent"" new Office at a initial cost of $70 a year. Screen quality is great and I really like the touch screen"
461,Got this laptop bcuz of windows 11 while unboxing it i realised it had windows 10 safe mode sigh.
462,Easy to setup and great design
463,"I really like it, I use it for online teaching.  It is great, the hdmi access is so much easier."
464,"So far I like it but as the headline states, it doesn't have windows 11 installed, only window 10 in safe mode.  Update: easily upgraded to Windows 11."
465,Clean lines and extremely functional. Very Happy with the speed and performance. I would recommend it for the daily user.
466,"Unfortunately,  I didn't need this item, but heard it was a great find. I was able to get my current laptop fixed"
467,The affordable prices....
468,Cheap maid. Did not like it for the money @!!
469,"I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!"
470,"This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop."
471,"A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as ""basic needs"" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to ""S Mode"" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?"
472,"A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend."
473,BUYER BE AWARE: This computer has Microsoft 10S. This is scam software by Microsoft to force you to use only Microsoft apps from their deserted island wasteland of an app store. The computer will not allow you to do anything else. You can upgrade to a full version of Microsoft 10... for another $134. Hard pass. STAY AWAY from ALL computers with Microsoft 10S!! Absolute garbage software.
474,"I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and ""safe."" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be."
475,It runs amazing
476,"*UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant ."
477,"The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5"" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5"" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an ""upgrade your edition of Windows"" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the ""Go to the Store"" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the ""helpful"" button! Thank you!"
478,"I bought this laptop for its weight and that's about the only thing positive I can say about it.The processing power is not very strong, so performance-wise, I was not impressed. But with the pricetag considered, I'm all right with this.However, the biggest thing for me is the OS- WINDOWS 10-IN S MODE.I had never heard of S Mode, and I didn't notice this when I bought the laptop.Apparently, S Mode is Microsoft's way of ensuring that you only use their apps and products by blocking you from downloading any outside apps. You have to get them all through their store. So, for example, were I to try to download Norton's anti-virus from Norton's official site, Microsoft's S Mode would tell me that I am unable. Any and all files outside of their store are blocked from being downloaded.In order to leave S Mode, you have to change it in the settings, but then you have to use a registration key for Windows 10 Home or Pro. So I shelled out another $130 just to get a fully functioning OS. Factor that price into this laptop price. THEN- after purchasing Windows 10 Home, I had to keep trying over the course of 4 days for the laptop to accept me switching out of S Mode because Microsoft was conveniently having server errors on their side and so my request could not be processed at this time. This is a common issue, at least from what I read among those discussing S Mode on Reddit forums. Multiple people report that Microsoft has server issues when you try to opt out of S Mode.Very very unhappy with this laptop for the sole reason that the OS is Windows 10 in S Mode. It was inconvenient and one of the most useless things I have ever seen pre-installed on a computer. Created a major and unnecessary headache for me."
479,"I was hesitant getting a Chromebook as I was concerned I'd miss being able to install windows programs, but so far I am really impressed with this. It was very quick to setup and easy to sync all of my Google account info. Having the ability to install Google apps is great. It's lightweight, runs fast, and seems to have a long lasting battery.As far as shipping it came packaged really well and the condition is 9/10 with only a slight smudge on the top of lid."
480,Did not come with a charger
481,5 months is all this piece of crap lasted! Conveniently past the 90 warranty window.  I called the 3rd party seller and had a mini argument about their company standing behind their products...  He told he that I would have to take this into a repair shop to have a new microphone and camera installed.  I told him that I knew that this would cost more than the laptop itself.  It said it would be around $40.  Well guess what the report shop said.  Exactly what I knew from the beninging...it would cost $300 plus the laptop would never function the same.  DO NOT BUY!!  Save yourself the waste of money....  buy new and not from a 3rd party seller
482,I have no cell phone to get instruction s - this is not a laptop  - the keys are different and I have no idea how to use this -  I can barely hear it -  it takes forever just to load facebook -  it constantly buffers -  I see why it was discounted  -  junk.
483,I have another chromebook but it has an 11 inch screen.  I was surprised that this one with a 14inch screen has better battery life.  Mostly I am browsing internet so I don't need all of the slowness and problems associated with Windows 10.
484,"Exactly as described. Havent tried the touch screen yet because I keep forgetting it's an option. The chromebook is definitely different then I'm used to, but it has been an easy transition."
485,"I need Bluetooth for some things.  This unit will not run Bluetooth without completely taking away all my bandwidth for wifi.  I get 12M down but fire up Bluetooth and I drop to 1m or less.  So tube videos are  impossible to watch.  Even listening to just music via BT although not as drastic will still cause the audio to stutter/stop and start.The next thing is the wifi range is not as good as all my devices...  50 ft and the transfer rate down is a 1/3rd down...  <>8M....  All my devices run above 11M...  So sadly I am returning the unit.The BT issue has been known about for quite a while.  I would not have thought there would be any problem with BT...My Mac, PC win 10 laptop runs BT just fine an there is absolutely no bandwidth traffic!I borrowed a friends older Lenovo chromebook and it demonstrates the same thing.  His wifi speed was good.Jim"
486,"So the laptop is very portable,  easy to use, and pretty fast. The problem is I bought this as a Christmas gift, so didn't open or test it when I got it. After opening it we found that the webcam doesn't work. We tried ever solution we could find online but nothing worked. I tried to contact the seller and they we next to useless just telling me to refresh it, then never replying again. So I ended up having to but another laptop for zoom meetings for school. If you can I'd at the very least avoid this seller."
487,14 inch is a great size if you want something medium size. Very light weight and easy to use. Usbc cord is great so all of the devices that I own use the same charger. I got this for under 200 and it was well worth it if you need something to type and simple web browsing. My only wish was that this was touch screen and I didn't realized I needed touch screen at the time...
488,DO NOT ORDER THIS!!! I ordered something this and got a lower grade of Chrome book(N22 which is worth less than half the price of the laptop in the display).
489,"I've only had it about a week, and it has been constant troubleshooting.  When it works, I like the keyboard, the display is crisp and it boots up fast and switches tasks quickly.  But things didn't (and some still don't) work out of the box, and there is too much spamware installed.The right click on the touchpad did not function out of the box.  I researched a bit, couldn't find a good solution, but after I did a BIOS update for a different problem it seems to work now, although with a fiddly two finger gesture instead of just one finger clicking in the bottom right like every other laptop I've got.  It is a dice roll whether it registers both fingers or not, so you might get the right click menu, you might just open links or jump to somewhere else in the program and then have to get back and try again.  I'm guessing I'd get used to this.You do get Windows pre-installed.  The license key is a bit hard to find in case you need/want to reinstall it, but you can find it in the BIOS.  It boots real fast, so it is tricky to get to the BIOS menu.  Windows also doesn't seem to actually shut down, so when you open up the lid, it is already past the BIOS prompt (with the default settings).  Microsoft requires a Microsoft account to even use the computer, which isn't Lenovo's fault, but annoying.  Lenovo comes with ""helpful"" admin tools to update firmware and the BIOS, but you have to set up a Lenovo account to do so.  That is a pain, and I exited out, only to see that I've got an email verifying my Lenovo account, apparently populating it with info from the Microsoft account that I just set up.  I don't want to be paranoid, but Microsoft had me set up an account and five minutes later my information is being used to set up other accounts.  Not a good look for either side - how am I supposed to trust anything I do on this laptop?But even worse is the Lenovo software is like continuously being asked about your car's extended warranty, warning you about all the bad things that will happen and upselling you on better support.  How many people are buying a $500 laptop and needing on-site replacement services?The biggest problem by far is that I still don't know what the USB-C port does.  I initially set it up using my docking station.  USB-C charging didn't work.  It didn't recognize a second display.  It did recognize the ethernet connection and mouse and keyboard.  Reading up, it looks like it is fiddly with exactly which docking stations it will talk to.  I'm currently leaving one job, starting another, and for . . . reasons . . . , I currently have 5 daily use laptops, all of which work flawlessly with a ""high end"" Dell docking station.  I also have a ton of cheap ones from the last year hooking up school Chromebooks to various monitors.  None of them work with this Lenovo.  It will recognize the second display if I plug in the HDMI cable directly.  I have also tried any number of adapters to plug into the USB-C port - from Chromebooks, from a MacBookPro, from a dedicated USB charging hub that far exceeds the power requirements - no luck.  It doesn't recognize any of them to charge.  It does have a second charging port with a dedicated, proprietary connector which works well enough, but the brick that plugs to the wall is large and the cord is short-ish and the charging port is on one side of the machine only, which limits where I can actually use it.Speaking of which, the battery is nowhere near the 8.5 hours advertised.  More like 4, with the settings out of the box.  That is enough for me, but I had 75% charge left, suspended the computer and closed the lid, and it was completely empty 6 hours later.  I'm not sure you could be doing anything less with the computer, and it still drained the battery pretty quickly.  I've played with disabling some BIOS settings but don't see a huge difference.  If I don't have it plugged in overnight, it is dead in the morning.Other than that, no problems :)  I actually like the computer when it is running, it is much better than the one I am replacing, performance-wise.  But things did not work out of the box, and having a half-baked USB-C port that doesn't charge is probably a deal breaker for me.  I'm waiting on another docking station that has been reported to work well with this laptop before throwing away the days of configuration and returning it.  Who knows, maybe I just got a bum USB port and it does work out of the box for everyone else."
490,"This is my second Lenovo and I wouldn't have bought another one if the first wasn't a gem. The touchscreen can be very handy if you aren't a touchpad user (which I'm not) and you don't have space to use a mouse (such as on a plane). The only drawback on this particular model is no backlit keyboard.  Otherwise,  I give it 5 stars."
491,"I'm delighted with my new computer.... The only issue is that the fingerprint sensor isn't working, but everything is cool and despite the computer is made from plastic, it feels very classy."
492,very good home type computer
493,"WiFi died and even a complete software reset would not fix it, clearly a hardware issue. I am having to not only pay this seller to return it they are going to charge me a 20% restocking fee because I threw the box away THE DAY BEFORE IT DIED!"
494,"According to the Yale School of Management, Lenovo continues to pursue business interests in the Russian Federation even though scores of other reputable companies have withdrawn from the country."
495,"I bought this laptop for scientific computing, and I was waiting for one with an 8-core processor for parallelized computations. When I saw a Ryzen 8-core processor, 32 GB RAM, and the price, ~$900 before tax, it ticked. This HP-Ryzen laptop exceeded my expectations in speed and energy efficiency. I ran a benchmark test of Wolfram Mathematica (the software I use for computations) and the results were far above all other computers listed there for comparison. At the same time, the laptop does not consume much energy, its power adapted is small. I run a parallelized computation using all 8 cores for hours and the laptop's body is only a little bit warm. I do not hear any sound of the fan. This is a huge step forward in comparison to my previous laptops with Intel i7 processors that consumed a lot of energy and were getting hot even in the idling regime.On the other hand, it is apparently not a gaming laptop as it has an AMD Radeon graphics card, no expensive Nvidia that I don't need. Comparable gaming laptops (8 cores) on Amazon cost twice as much.I haven't found any serious drawbacks yet. A small drawback is that the keyboard is not illuminated from within, the body of this laptop and its keys are gray, while inscriptions on the keys are not white but grayish. With low light, you don't see them well, and you cannot work at night without a light. The keyboard is much better visible on my preceding Dell Inspiron laptop (Intel i5, also energy efficient and overall good) that has a black surface and keys, white key inscriptions, and keyboard illumination."
496,"great update from my 10 yr old lenovo t430.it is light and super fast, sturdy built and i like the touch.setup was easy and upgraded to win 11 in no time. fabulous interface. like the new windows!very happy with the purcahse."
497,Overall performance of the laptop is good. I primarily bought it for educational purposes and it definitely meets my needs.
498,It never worked as it should it seemed to be reconditioned
499,"I use the laptop for PowerPoints, projection, Xcel, etc.  Utilize it on a network and it hooked right up and worked great.  Not a single complaint.  Love it!"
500,My people say it works great!
501,"Mic doesn't pick up well when speaker is off or at edge of camera, but it is faster than the Ryzen 5 I murdered, lighter weight, too. I thought I would miss my 17in screen, but 15in is okay since the resolution is good."
502,"This is a long review.  To summarize, you get what you pay for and then some.  This is a very usable package at a bargain price.  Nothing is top-of-the-line, but you will get a nice, compact machine for web-based activity.This is my first Chromebook.  Previously I have used Macs and laptops from Toshiba and Lenovo.  I decided to go with a Chromebook because I mostly email, browse pages, Zoom, and watch Youtube.  Anything I need to do document-wise can be covered by Google.  The compactness and long battery life is a big plus.  I'm tired of big, heavy laptops wearing holes in my bags.This Chromebook weighs 2-1/4 .lbs, which is excellent.  It is about the size of a magazine, so I would not hestitate to take it anywhere.  The body is plastic, which is durable and easy to keep clean.  It's not as nice as metal, but it is generally solid.  The bottom panel is a teeny bit loose, but that is a nitpick.Battery life is as advertised.  Depending what you do you get around 10 hours or more, which is more than double any laptop I have used.The screen opens to 135 degrees (or 45 degrees against the tabletop).  I was disappointed it did not open to a full 180, but I can work with it.  Screen brightness is listed at 220 nits (on the low end), but don't let that deter you; it is as bright as my 8 year old Macbook and my Lenovo laptop assigned by work. For indoor use, it works just fine.  If you work outside, you will have to find shade.  The display quality is not the best, but perfectly useable.  It is an IPS display, which provides better viewing angles and color rendition.  The 11.6"" screen is enough real estate for watching videos and reading the news.  I can type this review and read my email side by side.  This is also a touch screen, which seems to work fine in my limited experience.  When laying down with the Chromebook on my chest, it's nice to just browse using the touchscreen.  I have downloaded a few Android games, and they work great on the touchscreen.  IMO spend more for the touch screen if you want to use Android apps.The keyboard is a comfortable size.  I am typing efficiently without making lots of mistakes.  Most of the keys are where you expect them to be.  The specialized Chrome keys don't interfere.  The keys themselves have a nice, positive response.  Equally responsive is the trackpad, which comes with a full repertoire of gestures for scrolling, zooming, and viewing apps.  One thing I noticed is you can only physically click on the botton half of the touchpad, but I usually tap to click.The on-board speakers are a nice surprise.  They are loud and clear.  An audiophile might find them slightly tinny, but I can listen to music for hours using just these speakers.  There is minimal distortion when I crank the volume up to max. Of course, there is a headphone jack and bluetooth capability.32 gigs of memory may be challenged if you install a lot of apps.  The Chrome System takes up about 13 GB on its own. I have inserted a 128 GB Micro SD card, which can be used as storage for Android apps that support it.  For example, I can download music from Youtube Music to my SD card.  Documents from the Text editor and Camera app can be directed to the SD card as well.Regarding the processor, I don't do anything that has taxed this system yet.  I usually only have a couple of tabs and apps open, and I play a few games.  Keep in mind this is the same processor on the almost universally lauded Lenovo Duet Chromebook, so it is no slouch.The 720p webcam is adquate for web conferencing, taking snapshots or recording videos.  It's a little grainy with indoor lighting.  People seem to hear me fine using the internal microphone, but works best if you are sitting right in front of the computer.  The mic input can be adjusted if you expand the volume options in the wifi/battery/time options.One last cool thing is you can charge this Chromebook with a phone charger (with the right cable).  It is slow, and must be done while the Chromebook is not in use.  I was able to get 15% per hour using a basic phone charger.  It might be nice if you are traveling and don't need to lug around the clunky power supply that comes with this Chromebook.Overall, I am happy with my purchase. This is a nice value package that delivers."
503,"I first want to say that mechanically this laptop worked great. The company that sent it also sent it very fast, arriving ahead of the projected date. Now that positivity is out of the way, why am i returning it?Say what you want about me, but i didn't realize that this device used a different OS. I originally wanted an affordable laptop for some word processing. Chrome OS does not allow you to do this. Functionally it could,  but it designed to be an internet browser and little else. Do you have a phone? Well, your phone is capable of everything this device can do and more. Why would anyone need a laptop with less functionality than a phone?Many software programs support a variety of operating systems. They do not currently work with Chrome OS. You cannot even attempt to download them. I have heard that you can download apps (not that i was able to experience this for myself), but that will be the only downloading of programs that you might have access to.This now leads to my final gripe, the device is basically online only.A browser cannot function without internet, so it is with this device. It seems to be so dependent on this that it actually bugged out when i tried to delete the only wifi connection it had. (which reminds me, there is no way that you can factory reset this device. There is no option to do so, take that as you will.) When you first start up this device, it will force you to connect to the internet. You can skip putting in you Google account info, but it will not allow you to proceed without internet.Tldr: Don't get anything with Chrome OS. Your phone is capable of so much more than this ever will be."
504,"This is a great Chromebook for a middle to highschooler. It has a real long battery life charges quickly, and maintains a strong wireless signal. The touchscreen is very responsive and we haven’t had any problems with it at all. It has a very comfortable keyboard."
505,"I only use a computer for personal stuff, e-mails, facebook, random stuff., a zoom meeting once a week. I'm 72 and needed a lighter, smaller one than my dinosaur of a laptop. This fits the bill perfectly. It weighs less than the average book, it has a very long battery life, its size and weight makes it easily portable, and I can have it outside on the deck for hours without losing power. I love the touchscreen, and it was not hard converting to the Chrome OS from Windows. The only thing this didn't offer was a backlit keyboard, but since It's white, w/white keyboard, It's not hard to see even in dim light. So easy to use and carry, and easily contains everything my old computer had downloaded--and that's a lot!  I Love It!"
506,"It's very important to note, this is a Chromebook NOT a full-sized laptop, so this may be much smaller than expected.Personally, I love this Chromebook, size and all. It works great and has a pretty decent quality. No issues with so far with charging, battery life, crashing, etc. I would only hope for a better sound quality, as it doesn't get very loud at all. Plenty of storage space for me as well, as I use it for crafting (Design Space app, emails, saving photos, etc.) I would also recommend this for those looking for something small with a keyboard for school use."
507,"This is perfect for what I need. I  am a writer and have been writing on a kindle tablet, and it was just too small."
508,"I like the Chromebook, but it restarts itself every day on its own. I've had it for less than a month. I believe the MicroSD card slot is too close to the power cord slot. I leverage my thumb on the side of the Chromebook to pull the power cord out (the spot where the MicroSD card slot is) so I end up uninstalling the card. No, there's no other way to carefully remove the power cord. I've had several Chromebooks and never had issues until this one."
509,"I didn't realize how small it was however it's a nice laptop,the screen did go black for a full day, it was charged an everything,for some weird reason it came back on, that's the only issue I've had with it"
510,"Make sure you read the fine print. I received my chromebook. The package it was in was already opened. A little annoyed I paid for a new one and got a used one but it looked ok. Plug it in to start using it and check it out. Kept saying it was charging. Unplugged it the next day only for it to cut righty back off and say it was dead. I tried another chromebook charger and the same thing happened. So I decided to get some support. Amazon was nice but made me try all the things I already did. After nothing worked, again. They told me to contact the seller, there was nothing else they could do to help me. I reached out to the seller and got no reply. And apparently I can’t return it. For any reason whatsoever. So now I have a cr*p laptop that I just wasted $ on that I guess I’ll now have to pay to take somewhere to fix it. So annoyed and disappointed. I haven’t even had it a few days and can’t even return for a replacement or to get my money back. Cool cool cool. Thanks"
511,"If my labtop goes to sleep, when I try to use it from sleep the screen is split.  The botton half is on top and the top part is on the bottom.  And nothing can be done to fix this other than logging out and shutting down and restarting the computer. This becomes very annoying after a while.  Also, with regularity, the notebook simply freezes and again, the only remedy is to shut down and restart. A third regret is that it is very, very slow, much slower than the 5-year old Acer Chromebook (similar price) that I am trying to replace because it's nearing 5-years old and Chrome no longer supports my Acer Chromebook with security updates.  The HP Chromebook is such poor quality that I don't use it anymore, I'm back to using my 5-year old Acer Chromebook.  I have a few more months until it's no longer supported.  I think I will try the Pixelbook Go, it seems to have good reviews and I have much higher hopes for it.  I'm so disappointed with the HP that I will never, ever consider another HP product.  Such low, laughable quality."
512,I did not know that the Chromebook I purchased was ‘refurbished’ until I received it.  The price pd was for a new laptop. I feel cheated. I am not happy.
513,"Its a basic Chromebook.  Nothing fancy but does exactly what I need it to do.  Internet searching, emails and can stream  amazon video.  Going to experiment with Google Docs and slides also.  For the money...I think it was a great purchase."
514,"I was not sure I would like a Chromebook. Quick start up. Once you figure out how to work off line and navigate, it's not that different from other formats. You can easily add memory via a thumb drive or micro sd card. The only thing I can't do is a wireless connection to my printer.  Small inconvenience for the cost of the laptop. It is plenty fast for office apps and the internet with the battery lasting all day. Thumbs up."
515,"The  HP Chromebook is an excellent multi purpose laptop. It can be used for researching online, budgeting and finances, games, music and movies. Shopping for anything needed for the entire family.Taking classes on line or for homework for students."
516,"It looks new and is fast, has a long battery life, and is spot on what we needed.  Just a fast device that we can search the web on and project onto a television screen.  Lightweight so we can move it around easily and small so it tucks away when not in use.  Can't beat the price for this level of computer."
517,"The laptop was purchased renewed. Be careful who you purchase from. Mine was severely compromised and infected all of my androids. I suggest to thoroughly inspect it first and if something seems out of the norm, return item immediately. Such as logging in and out. Be safe and spend a few xtra dollars on a new one if you can. I wish I would of. Just a warning. I'm sure not all of the sellers are untrustworthy but the few that are? Beware."
518,We bought this product for my father in law as a gift.  He's a novice to say the least at technology and couldn't be more pleased with the product.  Company did a great job and it arrived two days after the purchase in a secure box and packaged to ensure no damage would take place.  I would definitely order from them again!
519,The laptop I received is not what I expected. This laptop does not want to turn on no matter what power adapter I use. The problem is with the computer itself. It's very inconvenient and incredibly disappointing.
520,was delivered with a user id still on it.  renewed?  No one even looked at it.  Total BS
521,This computer does NOT have a backlit keyboard as advertised in the product description.
522,"My only gripe is the screen itself. Has a backlight sheen, so you have the have the right angle to see colors correctly. Had to download a second party program to change gamma and brightness, but it looks better now.Has SD slot, and my first Windows 11 computer. Everything installs and works properly. A backlit keyboard would be nice, but I knew it didn’t have one when I bought it."
523,"I just got this computer today and my first impression is: it's loud. The keys are not clicky but sort of hollow sounding, which isn't too bad. The fans turn on and off constantly and WEEEESHHHHHHHH for minutes at a time (all I've done so far is load Chrome). The worst thing for me is the touchpad makes a sound like you're dragging your finger over bad paper from grade-school chapter books. I'm autistic (and admittedly have a headache right now ((there go the fans for no reason))) and I'm extremely sensitive to noises and this fffsffssffsfsfsfsfssssssss sound is super irritating. My old HP had a nice smooth touchpad that literally made NO NOISE, why oh why would they change it? I'm already trying to duck the noise my own fingers are making, or using my other hand to cover it up to deaden the noise. I'll end up using this with headphones in a lot, which will make my husband sad...Still sitting here with the fans going, and they actually cover up the noise of the touchpad... That's not a solution.I'm sure I'll be back with more to say but this was my immediate unhappy impressionnext day update: WHY DIDN'T ANYONE MENTION THAT ####### ### ###### ######## ###### LIGHT ON THE F6 KEY ????? It comes on when you push mute,,,,which, I ALWAYS have my computer on mute. I realise I could just turn down the volume but I want to push the mute button. And now when I do, this annoying orange light comes on that's a tiny sun in a dark room, very distracting. I hate it and now have put .99 cent nail polish on my 750$ machine.FEW DAYS LATER: the nail polish is holding up, but using this thing with only WoW running on it (that's it, that's all that on it) it's like being on the moores on a windy night. Just WEeeEEEEEEEeSHHHSEeWWEEEEEEEEESssshEEEEEEEWEEEEEEEHHHHHWWSSSSSS constantly from the processors, it's high pitched and incessant.The arrow keys are weird shaped and too small (for laptop gaming purposes) but at least the entire spacebar and touchpad work which is more than I could say for the Dell I had."
524,"I was skeptical when I ordered this because there was not a model included in the description. But I have never had an issue returning anything I have ordered through Amazon in the past so I decided to go for it.Yes, it is an HP laptop! It is actually an hp laptop model 15-ef2127wm . I ordered the one with 32GB RAM and 1 TB SSD drive. I wanted something with similar specs to my desktop pc. I have been extremely pleased with the performance!I tried to take a picture since the product information is on the bottom of the laptop. However, the font is extremely small and the black on gray isn't the best contrast so the image tends to be blurry. If I could change one thing about it I would have the keyboard backlit. I like that the cooling vent is on the top between the screen and the keyboard. I tend to play City of Heroes Homecoming for hours on end. I changed my graphics settings for the appearance over performance and this laptop never seemed to get hot even after 8 hours of gaming!I am not into VR gaming so you might check with HP on that. it will upgrade to Windows 11. I personally have not done this because my desktop pcs are not compatible and I like to have everything on the same operating system."
525,"I've been looking for a new laptop.  This is the third one I've bought, and I'll probably end up keeping it against my better judgement just because I'm tired of looking.  My main issue is that the product listing says this is a new 2022 model.  And it comes with UDB-C data only.  None of my docking stations work with it at all.  It doesn't send video.  No charging.  It doesn't recognize etherrnet.  It doesn't recognize a mouse or keyboard or anything besides a USB storage device.  Yes, you can use the HDMI port on the laptop and that works fine.  And it has two USB A ports for a keyboard and mouse and you can hope you don't need anything else.  And you can pray you don't lose or damage the charger, because it is of course non-standard.  I move between my desk and other areas enough that plugging and unplugging all of the peripherals multiple times a day is not a good thing.This isn't the highest end laptop, but for the price missing this functionality makes no sense.  My $150 chromebooks have had this for years, as have all of my work laptops from a variety of manufacturers.You might ask why I'm on my third laptop and why I still keep making this error?  The product copy of this on Amazon doesn't mention it either way.  But, I had other questions, and found the model on other websites and the HP website, and those indicated a docking station was supported.  The previous one I returned to Amazon because it specifically said it had support and didn't.  The first one I returned somewhere else, because I saw USB-C and charging/monitors have been supported for so long, I just assumed this would work, plus one of the pictures talked about USB-C and had a picture of multiple monitors but had photoshopped all the wires out and they said after the picture was showing using the HDMI port on the laptop.This is also the reason I'm keeping it.  I look around at other similarly priced or slightly higher ones, and it is really difficult to tell if returning yet another one will make a difference - I guess I'll have to go see them in person to tell for sure.  Now, if I wanted a Chromebook, I know I could get one at 1/3 the price that supports this, but I really need a functional SSH client and X-Windows display.All of that said, the laptop is functional enough.  Fast to boot, quick to compile code, fast switching between programs, good display, above average battery life.  If only they'd tossed in a $5 part to have a real port."
526,"Nice computer, fast, good screen, but just stopped working after 3+ weeks of light use. You can turn it off, but the hard-drive continues running in the background and you cannot turn it on again for days! Fully charged, maybe you are in luck to turn it on -but- on most days you are OUT OF LUCK! Will return for credit! Used the Amazon Return policy within the allotted time period, printed the return label and returned item with extra packaging ($21) to the seller via UPS. Item was returned to seller on 2/6/2022 confirmed by UPS tracking and I am still waiting for a full refund by seller / Amazon."
527,"I wanted 16 GB of RAM and SSD hard drive but didn't need a ton of space.  Some of the complaints I have read are valid.  The USB-C port does not support video.  Hard to find anywhere in the description but if that's a deal breaker for you look for USB-C Thunderbolt.  There is an actual Thunderbolt beside the USB-C port.  I almost returned the unit because of the keyboard.  Although I didn't care if it was back lit (it's not), the contrast between the letters and key is not good.  I could not see the symbols in low light.  I bought a silicon keyboard cover for about 8 bucks from the Big A and now can easily see and I am more protected from spills.  For casual users this is a great unit.  It's light and I like the screen size and the 10 digit pad built in.  You want 3 screens and a ton of ports, better dig deeper into your wallet."
528,"This laptop was not advertised as having a touchscreen and does not have one, and is the reason for not rating a touchscreen.This laptop was for my grandson to have for school work and the on-line games he likes to participate in. He loves it and from what I have seen the laptop is very responsive and will work for him through school. Additional software is needed for word processing, etc. The only thing I did not like is, when opening and turning on the laptop it immediately goes into a setup and is a not pre-installed with Windows 11 OS, with only your personal preferences and connectivity to setup. I will update this review if to the contrary in a couple of months from now. So far, I do not expect to have to do an update."
529,"Well it worked for about 3 days before it had fatal OS issues, I have been in contact with HP since then and have ran the hardware tests a half dozen time and had to install windows 10 in order to get back to having an OS, but now the laptop cannot find a network... ""update"" returned laptop after wasting days trying to get it fixed, but hey there's a 72$ restocking fee for a garbage laptop so that's always nice."
530,It is bowed in the middle and twangs when I type.  Computer is fast and screen is good.  Is this a genuine HP laptop?
531,"I love everything about this HP laptop the quality, the screen, and battery life; everything is excellent! A good investment for doing university classes. Also, suitable for work/professional purposes as well."
532,"With only minor signs of use and a first boot fatal error that required a rescue usb, after around 2 weeks of use I must say that this is the right minimum specs for a daily office work without issues. 64gb allows to install some linux apps to work, battery arrived with 96% of health in diagnosis. I don't think you can't get better specs these days for the price. Recommended"
533,"Received in perfect condition, no sign of prior use. Chrome OS loaded normally and was updated to latest edition without issues. International delivery was surprisingly fast."
534,The battery life wasn't good and came with a scratch on top.
535,"Very well built and with an elegant design. Good processor, very fast. Quiet fan operation, cool keeping in palm rest area.I was surprised by the fact that it came with an ""HDD Kit"" (connectors), to expand the storage capacity with an internal HDD disk (I asked Asus and they replied that a HDD or SSD of up to 1 TB can be installed, to expand the capacity storage).Asus customer service is very good (it comes with MyAsus software that makes communication very easy); is one reason I bought this brand. Two years ago I bought an Asus 13 ""Notebook, I had a software problem with the keyboard lighting and in a few messages they guided me on how to solve it, until now I have never had problems again.I sincerely recommend this Notebook."
536,"Light weight, great start up speed with SSD drive.  Keyboard backlighting good for dim lights but key letters hard to see in medium light.  Ability to turn off keyboard backlighting is a plus and actually makes letters easier to see in bright light."
537,"I've been using my new ASUS VivoBook computer for over a week and have a few comments.  First, it's a great computer for those folks who like to work in the dark.  The contrast between the silver keys and the lighted characters is poor at best.  Key F7 allows four settings for the brightness of the characters, but the brightest one is still too dim. I find it easy to see the keyboard if I work in a dimmed setting.  I've owned two ASUS computers previously and both have had excellent keyboard contrast. Why did they change to a poor contrast keyboard? Without this fault I would give it a 5 star rating.This is sold as a portable computer.  At five pounds it might be better described as transportable.This computer does NOT have a touch screen as is advertised by Amazon. This is a good screen if you don't like looking at finger prints.Going to ASUS for help sends you to a ""paid-for"" tech group. This is a helluva way to provide support and ASUS should be ashamed!"
538,"Great laptop; very fast processor (i7), good RAM memory and nice solid state drive; there is no Touch Screen so don't know why Amazon wanted a rating on it; there are 2 issues:  support is only by email (almost useless for computers) and although it says it will support 2 monitors, it will ONLY if you close the laptop's lid; video card only supports a ""TOTAL"" of 2 monitors so don't plan on using the laptop's screen if you intend to use 2 external monitors - lid must be closed for it to display on both external monitors"
539,"Bought for my husband after his other asus only lasted 18mths. I was skeptical to say the least, but this was what he wanted. Aside from the volume being horrible, it appears to be working just fine. We’re only 2mths into it so I’m still very cautious."
540,"In the market for a new laptop?  I've found this unit to be exceptional, compared to my older Dell Latitude.  Speed, and the 17-inch screen feels good on my aging eyes."
541,Very happy so far--only drawback is that the speakers on this laptop don't get very loud....
542,"This laptop is a solid, well-built device with speed, great display, and a good keyboard.  The only downside I see is the audio quality.  Not as good as I had hoped."
543,
544,"Very nice laptop the screen is the right size, the only downside I have is the keys can be hard to see at times"
545,"This one has a super fast boot up time. The only issue I have so far is that the Capslock button had a light that worked when you clicked on it (so you know when it's enabled) but now it does not light up. The computer it self is pretty good. After doing so extensive research, this one was the ""worth it"" laptop that I needed. Good for school work and office work. Comes in ""windows S mode"" but its easy to switch out to a regular mode. All you need to do is install Chrome and google will tell you exactly what you need to do to switch out of the ""S"" mode. Screen quality isn't HD but you really won't notice the difference. I would have given a five star rating if it wasn't for the capslock issue. I wish they made this with a white color design.Update-  Some vibrations and crack in sound but still working good."
546,"Very disappointed, this was advertised as touch screen then on the description it says non touch screen and it’s much smaller than described. Very disappointed."
547,We mainly use this Computer for zoom meetings and work so it works perfectly for emails and things like that nothing special for us
548,"I bought this laptop because I really don't need anything fancy AT ALL! It was just supposed to be for my kids when they needed to do homework, and for me to use to search a few things on the internet and check my email.... THATS IT! It was RIDICULOUS! I seriously timed it just to prove my point, and from the time I turned it on to the time it was ready to actually use it took 15 MINUTES!! Now I am not one of these young kids who think if things don't happen in a blink of an eye, it is slow and I get mad. I grew up with dial up and so I am used to sitting and waiting on a computer. But this was worse than that. It would never fully load, when I typed on it, it wouldn't keep up, and it was always just turning off. Then to turn it back on, well that was quite the process that sometimes wouldn't happen that day. I am not techy in the least, I just want a computer to turn on, let me search a few things, and let my kids search a few things. I didn't think I asked that much. This computer didn't agree with me. So if you have the patience of JOB, this laptop just may be for you. If not, don't waste your time."
549,"This is my first Dell and I’ve called customer service twice for minor issues and they really go the extra mile, I’ve never experienced such great customer service before. Before purchasing my Dell laptop, I read about their renowned customer service and now I know it’s the real deal. My only complaint is the lackluster black generic case, miss having a shiny case; otherwise superb product."
550,"This laptop was a Christmas gift for my wife.  It powered up and the setup was done without issue.  We used it for a day, doing web-based apps and even watched some YouTube videos with no issues.  We used it again a couple of days later, but the performance was very poor.  Screens would hang and freeze for extending periods.  It was unusable.  We powered down and closed the device.  We were out of town and returned home a week later.  It powered up and was useable for a little while (an hour or two), then again became slow.  When typing a word, each letter would take several seconds to complete.  It was extremely frustrating and disappointing so we have returned it."
551,"Out of the box it was slow to start up and even slower to open any app. I spent days researching how to speed it up and still failed to get it to work. Issue others have with this model is for some reason, even with 16GB or more of Ram, it still has high CPU and high Disk use ongoing. Even when not doing anything. Activity monitor show this clearly. Worst part was I could not fix after a week(am pretty PC knowledgable), I contacted Dell and they finally concluded it must be a software issue and not hardware so I would have to pay them $99 to have tech help fix.Very let down since my first PC ever was a Dell XPS series that was awesome and lasted me 6 years.  It's a brand new PC and I have to pay to fix it. I thought he was joking. So I sent it back and ordered Macbook Pro."
552,"Computer was ordered with both SSD and HDD drives. The operating system was installed on the SSD while the HDD was unformatted and could not be seen by Windows 10. I am glad I was savvy enough to use utilities to see if the HDD was indeed installed, otherwise I would have had to return to the vendor and pay the return shipping fees (UPS would have been $34). If I had sent this to my wife or other family members, they sure would have returned the computer for not having the purchased second drive (HDD)."
553,"My new job as a department head for a city means I need to work almost anywhere on any given day - my office, a conference room, a public event, out in the Industrial Park or out of town. I have used this laptop for 60 days now in my car, my office, at the fire department, out in the desert at a solar farm and in three different cities. It just works everywhere and every time I need it. It connects instantly to my office wifi and my portable cellular signal hotspot every single time.The touchscreen is responsive and easy to use in tablet form or as a regular laptop. The ability to convert to a tablet has been immensely useful on the go for me - I bought the companion pen/stylus separately to add property line markers and such on satellite photos out in the field. I fold the computer and go into tablet mode seamlessly as needed. The overall processing speed is more than enough and I haven't experienced any lag at all even with multiple files, programs and functions going at once. It runs Microsoft Office and additional photo editing software and other stuff without any drama.I drag this laptop around in a padded case in a tote bag with various files I need for the day and it's light enough that I don't feel like I'm carrying an extra 10lbs of nonsense after a 10 hour day. My only real complaint is that the fingerprint reader is not always easy to use or fully functional. I have actually just quit messing with it entirely and instead use a 6 digit pin number to unlock the computer. It's been a dream for Zoom connections both in my office and on the go with the wifi hotpot only. I'm very glad I chose this laptop instead of the Surface or something different."
554,This laptop was the best deal of Christmas 2020!! It's an amazing price for everything that comes with it! My 13 yo son uses it primarily for gaming and has only good things to say. Buy this!! You won't be disappointed!
555,"The last laptop I bought - a Lenovo - had an optical drive. So nearly a decade old. But it was a total workhorse for work and home use. And needed replacement.After *lots* of reading and research I landed on the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro, in no small no part because my Samsung Galaxy 10+ phone has done so well.Also? This was in stock! Several others I looked at were either out when I started looking, or went to backorder while I was on the hunt. And the Amazon 5-payment plan was a little kinder on my budget.Screen is incredible. Backlit keyboard. RAM is nearly triple what my old machine had (16gb v 6), so using Photoshop now is no big deal while I'm using several other apps simultaneously. It sure used to be. And it takes about a second - yep - once you flip the screen open to wake.Downside? It's *very* thin and *very* light compared to my old machine, so that's taken some getting used to. I need to hold it in place while I open the screen. And right now it actually sits ON the old one when I'm working. But it's still new yet.Looks like it's a bit more expensive now ( I paid about $1100) but I think still a deal for what you'll be getting, esp if you haven't upgraded in a while as was my case.Highly recommend."
556,Super fast laptop.The screen is beautiful. I love the light weight.Nice packing.Best laptop I've ever won.The sould quality is amazing for this thin laptop. (You will have to go to the sound setting and press the advance speaker quality to activate the best sound possible)
557,This it's totally defected. I'm sending it tomorrow through UPS back to Amazon due to the fact that it will not charge. Stops at 44% and doesn't go on and it should charge in 30 minutes from what the information States. I am totally disappointed. There was no adapter in it either.
558,"Llevo unas semanas con mi Samsung Galaxy Book Pro y estoy más que feliz con ella, porque es súper rápida, sensible y con una calidad de imagen en la pantalla super espectacular ¡Lo mejor de lo mejor! Y más siendo a ese precio."
559,I absolutely hated windows 11 it's garbage and cost me down time trying to navigate is bs os
560,"Having laptops provided by employer for several years, I hadn’t purchased in a while. Usually I think budget, but this time I splurged a bit and I am very happy.Super lightweight and very fast startup and waking. AMZN also providing good link for MS 365 Office"
561,The laptop came with a faulty boot system and I had to install the Windows 11 from scratch to get it work. The laptop was unable to repair itself. It's actually a used one from the Amazon warehouse buy at least they should have warned that it might be defective.
562,Great Sound! Easily the finest laptop audio you can ask for at this price. Screen flickering at lowering brightness and does not look sharp enough for Full HD resolution. AMOLED colors are great as usual. battery life is decent.
563,Super fast machine. Fantastic screen resolution and color rendition. Lots of memory for manipulating big data files. Can't find anything to complain about. Writing code to do financial analysis on large Account Receivable files. The speed is amazing.
564,"Great device, really like it. Lightweight, fast, quiet, long battery life. Best notebook I had ever!The only disadvantage found by now - camera quality is quite poor.Even my 5 years old macbook has better camera."
565,"Just like that title says ... Nice Upgrade from my old Alienware-18 Gaming Laptop but the sound ABSOLUTELY SUCKS!. I had to buy a set of external speakers to go with it. It sounded like someone stuffed a pillow into the speakers, it is very muffled and beyond far too (fake-sounding) bassy."
