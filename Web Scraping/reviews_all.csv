Khansama Tandoori,khansama-tandoori-singapore,"So far, my fav restaurant in Little India. I have been here a couple of times, and will be back for more...  Anything from the tandoori oven is great, as well as lamb dishes ...and the dal makhani.  Rice biriani also good.  Butter chicken may be the only thing so far that was just meh.About the venue:  I have to say that the fact that there are no windows in the upstairs room is a bit strange! :-)",Nv_gr_ujHLRQ8_y0MjfKnw
Khansama Tandoori,khansama-tandoori-singapore,"I'm a regular at Khansama ever since i moved to Singapore about a year ago. This is my ""Happy Place"". I go here every weekend and atleast twice during the week.The food:Authentic, yummy, delicious North Indian food. You will *NOT* be disappointed! My favorite order here is the Chicken Tikka Masala with some Kulcha. The meat is always done just right, lots of flavor in portions that aren't too large, and aren't too small. A portion of curry here would serve two people just about.Recommend:Non Vegetarian:- Chicken Tikka Masala- Mutton Biryani- King PrawnsVegetarian:- Dal MakhniBreads:- Masala Kulcha- Rumali RotiThe service:The staff is very friendly, contrary to other reviews here. Just set up a conversation and remember that this is a very popular restaurant that's packed to the limit almost everyday so they're bound to be a little busyThe chairs:Oh gawd, this is the worst part! They're not comfortable at all no matter what size you are. There's no clearance between the chair and the table so it's a really awkward way to sit. The food makes it up for everything though :)Price:A typical meal for one here without alcohol comes to ~SGD $28 - $35. Remember to pay with ""Nets"" which is a state controlled payment method that has no fees compared to Visa which will tack on a few more dollars ;)",rwcQ7wgzmTr0cHcJ8e_ZfA
Khansama Tandoori,khansama-tandoori-singapore,"Excellent quick service, I had so many people waiting on me at the rush hour I was amazed. The food was great and I even ordered more to take home with me. I tried the mutton curry and it was excellent. I ended up bringing some chicken home with me and it was awesome.I definitely will be eating at this place again.",eeNJj7clxxalXJVKQibTyQ
Khansama Tandoori,khansama-tandoori-singapore,"Yes, yes, yes, yes, YES. The spice, the flavours, the bustling outdoor seating, the naan (oh god the naan), it was like each and every dish they brought out was better than the last. The menu was a feast in itself - I knew it would be bad (read: really freaking good) when there were 7 types of naan to choose from, but it got to the point where we were all just pointing and shouting and gesticulating wildly. As for the dishes that I dug into? The chicken tikka masala was dark, rich and spicy and the kadahi prawn was easily the best prawn dish I've ever had, but the real stand out was the super decadent chicken mughlayee. It was one of those situations where we wanted everything we saw going out to tables around us, so I doubt you'll go wrong. We were a bit surprised with the relatively high prices and rather slow food service (waiters were attentive, but it just took a reeeeeally long time for our food to arrive) but the second the food came out, all was forgiven and forgotten. All I can remember now is the food korma I had for the next several hours.",BUB_t_Rvzs1yPEzZipkWjw
Khansama Tandoori,khansama-tandoori-singapore,Very good tandoori chicken that goes great with the Strong indian beer (Haywards 5000). This is how the food is cooked back in a tandoori restaurant in India. Very good mughlai pasanda (better than the usual butter chicken which is good in itself). Good Indian food like the one in India. Reasonable pricing too.,1tQfj737uhgdKcQ-5akTdA
Khansama Tandoori,khansama-tandoori-singapore,"This is a review of a dinner date at Khansama Tandoori.tinyurl.com/amlyu3sThis is actually my second visit to Khansama.  I thought I had previously reviewed it.  I uploaded the photos but I must have forgotten to write the review.I will focus my review on my most recent visit.Khansama offers street-side outdoor seating and indoor seating (upstairs).  The outdoor seating was mainly full.  The restaurant does use staff on the street working very diligently and trying to get customers to eat there.tinyurl.com/aj7amvgThe indoor seating area is quite beautiful.  It is an odd combination though.  The room is very ornate.  The table tops are some type of granite or faux-granite.  But the chairs (and the plates) are plastic.  The first seat I sat in basically gave way.  Luckily, I did not spill onto the floor.On this evening, the indoor seating area was mainly empty.  tinyurl.com/bat3zcxThe staff was friendly, professional, and efficient. They are very attentive and helpful.  The order is quickly taken.  The food comes out quite fast.  They did insure there was a little staging with the starters versus the appetizers.  But, like most Indian restaurants, this is a relatively fast paced meal.I thought the food was pretty good.  My dinner companion thought that it was a bit spicy.  This included some dishes that are not necessarily usually on the hot side.  I expect it from a chicken vindaloo but not necessarily from a prawn masala. I actually didn't find it that spicy though.The starters were all quite good.  I thought the vegetarian samosas, Noor-eh-Elahi, and vegetarian pakora were delicious and also offered nice crisp textures.  I was less fond of the paneer pakora.  But that is primarily a person taste issue.tinyurl.com/b6as2wqtinyurl.com/bepc73btinyurl.com/a9xcwkxFor mains to share, I selected chicken vindaloo and prawn masala.For mains to share, she selected palak paneer and palak chicken.  She thought she had ordered only one dish.  The ordering was pretty frenzied so I am not sure.I thought the food was very good.  Lol, I especially enjoyed my two selections.   The vindaloo was spicy.  The chicken was tender.  The potatoes were well prepared.  For the prawn masala, the shrimp was also tender and the dish came together quite well.  I only dabbled a bit with her spinach laden selections.Of course, we also had saffron rice and naan (plain and garlic).I thought the rice was spot on.  The naan was only average.  The garlic naan just didn't seem to have that super freshly cooked garlic flavour that really makes great garlic naan great.tinyurl.com/a85z75uReceipt ($114.00):You can't really beat getting that much food for $114.tinyurl.com/a85z75uWe had way too much food and unfortunately neither of us are doggy bag people.  So, we left a lot of food on the table.  That was a shame.  I thought it was some pretty good Indian food.Overall, I like the room.  The service was good.  I thought the quality of the food was consistently there.  I do not think my friend enjoyed it nearly as much.  For me, it was a solid 3.5 stars but I rounded up.(another note, my first experience was very much in-line with my second visit)",3S53VaMDPy8Lywk2TuPb4A

The Coconut Club,the-coconut-club-singapore,"When I come to Singapore the thing I crave isn't chicken rice, chili crab, or carrot cake. What I want is a fragrant bowl of coconut rice, a nice fried chicken leg and nasi lemak.  The coconut club delivers a real solid nasi lemak and is definitively worth the wait and the small premium price you pay (12.8 SGD), which is only expensive if you compare to a hawker stall. Food: 4.25 starsService/environment: 4 stars Value: 4.5 starsOverall: 4.25 starsRecommendations: ""the basic"" nasi lemak, cendol with the read beanThe nasi lemak here hits all the notes that I'm looking for. The chicken has a crispy skin is nice and moist, the rice has a light coconut flavor to it and, and the mix of fried fish/nuts give some nice added texture and crunch. I have never had cendol before and I'm happy to try it here for the first time. It was really delicious and is a must if you are a coconut fan. The shaved ice is super flavorful and has hints of sweet coconut and coffee. (Highly recommed)",i-PdP5aXeLGG-Bmg1Wd0KQ
The Coconut Club,the-coconut-club-singapore,"Nasi lemak is the way to go. Yes, you should end your meal with some chendol, but you are missing out if you don't enjoy the nasi lemak.When you walk in, the open and bright interior welcomes you. The menu is simple and classic. The establishment is modern and trendy. The combination of the two creates this fun, casual, and nostalgic dining experience. Overall, this is a great place to unwind after a long day, catch up with some friends, or as the first stop of your incredible night.",cbzM6kE426dOaTvj9NPqww

The Coconut Club,the-coconut-club-singapore,"We spent our day and a half in Singapore going from one place to another: eating, eating, and eating some more. The Coconut Club was recommended by his friend and it was near where we were staying so it was a no brainer for our food itinerary.We showed up a few minutes before opening time and were one of the first to get seated. This place is known for its nasi lemak and so naturally, that's what we ordered. It was divine. It looks so simple on the plate but all the components complemented each other. Based on Yelp, we thought that The Coconut Club would be cash only but that is not the case at all. They accepted all major credit cards, which prevented us from having to run to the ATM.",2HchhLgGj16aITZGVy0hqA
The Coconut Club,the-coconut-club-singapore,"I must be slacking. This must be my 4th if not my 5th time back at at The Coconut Club for lunch and I have not written a review for it. Maybe subconsciously I don't want to share this place with others. :-)Very popular place for lunch in An Siang Hill. The owner is meticulous about his source of coconut and that is clear when you taste the nasi lemak.  Menu is really simple. One main dish of nasi lemak with 2 pcs of chicken (breast or leg aka light or dark), peanuts, fried anchovies, fried egg sunny side up, crunchy cucumber slices and a spoonful of sambal chili.  Besides the main dish, there are lots of sides like otah and sotong(squid). The main dish is big and I hardly have space for the sides. A good plate of nasi lemak must be fragrant with coconut without tasting like you are eating coconut. Nasi lemak at TCC is very good. I love the chicken pieces. So tender and deliciously marinated with ginger and other spices. Every little side items are fine so well. The ikan bilis (fried anchovies) is crispy. The peanuts are just the right size. Only one thing I'm unhappy about. The side of the plate is too shallow. I kept pushing my food out onto the table. Maybe that's just me. Lots of drinks of local flavors to choose from. Homemade calamansi (lime), homemade barley, bandung (rose syrup with evaporated milk) etc. For dessert try the chendol. It is made with palm sugar and coconut milk. You can have it with it without red beans. Go for the red beans. Today they had a special coconut jelly dessert that is so beautifully done. Looks simple but tasted complex. The jelly is smooth not like agar agar. The coconut meat gave it a nice texture. Small dish big taste (of coconut of course)Definitely a place to visit but be here around 1130-1145. Past that it will fill up and if you have a party of 6, be ready to wait at least 30 minutes.",Gh6sagblKhuMpWUDWeQjNg
The Coconut Club,the-coconut-club-singapore,"Excellent hearty brunch! Their signature dish, nasi lemak, was on point. Perfectly cooked egg, coconut rice, crispy and juicy chicken with nice selection of sides. Spice up how you like. Also choose from light or dark meat.We also tried the steamed fish cake which was not to our liking. Mackerel in what tasted like a fishy curry sauce, would not order again. Should have tried the shave ice dish everyone was raving over.Worth the wait for a tasty meal!",gs1HAp_sImvHS_yCfySaKQ
The Coconut Club,the-coconut-club-singapore,"Located in Chinatown not far from the CBD. You have to come here for The Basic - a local Peranakan specialty with coconut rice, chicken, an egg and spices. Also, do not skip dessert - the cendol is a coconut shaved ice with palm sugar on top, so refreshing and not very sweet. There might be a wait but it's worth it.",vHm25rFto4JfMDxhU3u4XA
The Coconut Club,the-coconut-club-singapore,"Had the Nasi Lemak based off a review I read on a blog. SO glad we went and that is what I ordered. We also had a spicy clam dish and that was equally as tasty. Not like eating at a hawker center, which was a nice break from our food explorations. There was a decent line to wait, but it was 100% worth it.The space was beautiful, and the service was friendly and quite speedy. It was very busy inside so we shared a table with another couple that we did not know. Not expected, but didn't hurt our experience at all.",_P6cFtou-HYukea6nEdkLA
The Coconut Club,the-coconut-club-singapore,"Hadn't realized the restaurant location had moved up the street; was walking in circles before being directed to the correct location. They are located at #26 (not #6), just a 2mins walk up the street. When we finally got to the restaurant, we were seated immediately (2 people at 6:45pm on Tuesday evening). The staff was friendly and approachable. Ordered the nasi Lemak and a side of the chicken satay. You can order your chicken as leg or breast. I went with leg. I enjoyed the meal. I've not had this dish before, so it's difficult to make any comparison. It's a classic dish you can find anywhere and at a cheaper price. But for my first experience. It was enjoyable.",iF3yMJpIro4TphlECAHEcg
The Coconut Club,the-coconut-club-singapore,"Small but cute place. Made it at 2:30 pm right before they close. No queue on a weekday. Food came out pretty fast. Service was pretty good for Singapore. Make sure to bring cash just in case their machine is still broken!The traditional teh ($2.50) was good.The iced lemongrass was pretty much ice water with lots of sugar infused with a hint of lemongrass. I found it too sweet and not that flavourful.The nasi lemak ($12) was pretty standard. The rice was not that rich or creamy. More on the dry side I found. Not that flavourful but can still taste the subtle hint of coconut. The sambal was really spicy but alittle sweet. The fried egg was done okay. Runny yolk and not overcooked.The chicken was good with very flavourful batter. I really liked the crunch. It was not dry inside.The sotong ($15) was cooked well. Not tough. Very spicy but delicious.Food overall was good, but as expected in eating out in Singapore, prices were steep.Up to you to decide if it's worth it to pay this much for air conditioning and a cleaner environment compared to the cheaper more traditional hawkers with almost the same quality. Maybe it's nice to experience this just once.",823Dnvcl40ilhKcixVfTkA
The Coconut Club,the-coconut-club-singapore,"This is my go to place for delicious nasi lemak. The rice is really infused with coconut flavor and is not overly strong. The flavor also does not taste synthetic like some other places. I will suggest to just get the nasi lemak and maybe a lemongrass drink. That is light and refreshing. The nasi lemak comes with sambal (not too sweet or spicy), fried egg with runny yolk (not all the time), cucumber, crunchy ikan bilis and peanuts and two pieces of fried chicken. The fried chicken is yummy, the best thing next to the rice. The side dishes are ok, not that special or fantastic to warrant the prices. Same for the desserts. It gets crowded fast, so you will only be seated if everyone is your group is there.",Q1oMmm7tKPOzA7_gqcV4zg

The Coconut Club,the-coconut-club-singapore,"Great place for nasi lemak! It is more expensive (S$12.80) than what you would pay for nasi lemak at other places, but I think it's well worth it for the quality of the food and the pleasant, air-conditioned environment.Food:- Nasi lemak: The restaurant offers this as their only entree, and it doesn't disappoint. The chicken was juicy and tender, while the sambal was delicious with just a bit of a kick. I thought the flavors mixed together very well and I couldn't stop eating it. You can also ask for more rice as well!- Sambal sotong: This dish was basically chopped squid in the sambal sauce. Was a bit pricey and I wasn't a huge fan of the taste, so I would recommend just sticking with the Nasi lemak.Service:I showed up at 7pm on a Saturday and the restaurant was pretty full, but it only took about 10min for us to get a table inside. The waitress was quite funny and also took the time to explain the menu to us in detail. The inside of the restaurant is quite nice and not too crowded, which made for a good dining experience overall.Price: $$Though more expensive that most nasi lemak places, still pretty reasonable at S$12.80 for the basic plate. I found this pretty filling, especially given that you can add more rice.",yUyX5ImYidUOt_Dt7qLhWg
The Coconut Club,the-coconut-club-singapore,"Seriously the best Nasi Lemak in Singapore!Yes, it will cost you more than a hawker meal, but each part of this dish - the chicken, the ikon billis, the peanuts, coconut rice - is done with attention to  ingredients and preparation.AND, you get to sit inside :)They have recently moved to a larger space, so perhaps the wait lines will be shorter? Nothing to complain about here, just a warning if you are short on time.Enjoy!",Z1yy2pa7G3JB7JWJfmeg2A

The Coconut Club,the-coconut-club-singapore,"I was very disappointed with the service and the clam dish I ordered. I came for a late lunch and half the restaurant was empty but it took a while to get seated and get my order in. The server was very apathetic and obviously didn't want to be there. I figured it was because I looked like a tourist. We ordered Nasi Lemak and a spicy clam dish. Warning, do not order the clams. They served unopened clams and I asked the waitress if it was edible and she just stared blankly and walked away. I didn't want to take the risk because I was on vacation but a quarter of the clams were unopened. Please do no serve food that is inedible. Nasi Lemak was the only good dish here. It is more expensive than any other place. The flavors were unique and the chicken wasn't too dry.",u5FxG3p2FjWNFAmHA_mDQw

Ordered otah and turned up lukewarm. We asked to heat it up, took another 8 mins and still lukewarm. For $12.90 this nasi lemak is not worth the money except if you considered being in aircon room. Most staff has a no smile approach, some even just lazily hang around waiting for the junior staff to do all the work. Too eager to clear and basically hygiene wise, is bad cause the staff just take the tissue from table across my plate where I am still eating.

The Coconut Club,the-coconut-club-singapore,"Despite the price tag and what I thought would be too hipster to be good, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food at The Coconut Club! Of course, I still thought it was utterly overpriced, but for a nice restaurant in Club Street with a/c and yummy food? Aiight, I'll pay for it.I went on a Friday night and got a seat right away which is a nice change for Club Street that's always bustling and with people spilling onto the street. Service was fairly prompt, and it would have been nice to have the specials on the board instead of me having to ask if the menu was all there is to it and then the server then filling in the gaps on their specials of the day.I ordered the nasi lemak (of course) and the sayur lemak (which is apparently the less creamy version of sayur lodeh - it certainly tasted that way too) which was one of the specials. The nasi lemak came out looking delicious! The rice was coconut-y and fragrant, the egg was a nice oozy crisp, the ikan bilis was fried without being too hard, the chilli was a little too much on the spicy side (and just not as delicious as the one at Adam Road) and the chicken was glorious. The chicken was a full thigh and drumstick, was marinated in this delicious marinade (lots of local herbs - lemongrass and the like) and fried to juicy perfection. Yum. The sayur lemak had a really good broth - possibly ikan bilis? I made the unfortunate mistake of mixing all the chilli into it and ended up sniffling my way through my meal although it was really quite delicious. Although they also serve alcohol, my dining companion and I both got the lemongrass tea which was serviceable.This was all-in-all a very satisfying meal, and although I might still return to Adam Road for my nasi lemak fix (at a much lower price point too), I wouldn't say no to anyone asking me to get nasi lemak if I were ever in the Club Street area.",cCZpMsB_EXkMyn_OvQbdEA

Jing Hua Xiao Chi,jing-hua-xiao-chi-singapore,"On a hot day in Singapore, I decided to venture out into the world, barely avoiding heat stroke. To be honest, I wasn't that hungry but I didn't want to let a minute go to waste since I don't make it to SG that often. I was staying in Chinatown and had arrived earlier that day, so I figured I would eat close to my hotel in case the sun became too much.Chinatown is full of shops and dumplings. Unfortunately, it is also full of tourists.I did my best to avoid tourists and found a small dumpling shop hidden behind a construction zone. I figure the construction zone is not usual because the the shop, Jing Hua Xiao Chi, had been featured multiple times on various ""Best Dumplings"" lists. Okay, so it wasn't the hidden gem I was hoping for but it was definitely not riddled with tourists and that was good enough for me!The walls were red and tastefully (pun intended) decorated with photos of dumplings. Overall the shop was small and fairly empty. I didn't spot a single tourist out of the three groups that were in the restaurant. The staff was nice and sat me quickly and a menu and ordering pad were waiting for me at the table.I was running short on cash and Jing Hua didn't take cards (for the amount I spent.) Fortunately, the dumplings weren't too expensive. After entering the shop, I immediately looked at the menu to see what drinks they had. I needed something refreshing after a short walk that seemed to take an eternity. I noticed they had a Mango Juice on the menu for $3 ($2.20 USD) and I went for it. It was more than I would prefer to spend on a drink but this kind of stuff goes for $10 in California, plus I was desperate.I wanted to check every box on the menu but remembered the minimal cash I had in my wallet and decided to go with the classic Xiao Long Bao for $8 ($5.88 USD) an honest steal compared to SF prices. I've had many a Xiao Long Bao and part of me wanted to try one of the pan fried dumplings, but alas, I decided to play it safe and go with a fan favorite.The Mango Juice was just what I needed. It was refreshing and slightly thick. If it wasn't made of real mango it certainly had me fooled. There was an odd touch of rose water but it grew on me and I downed the whole thing pretty much before the dumplings came. I don't even like mango, but I liked this.Not long after the Mango Juice arrived, a plate of steaming-hot dumplings was placed right in front of me. I was so excited but slightly nervous because I didn't want to be disappointed by this apparently-famous dumpling house. The classic soy/vinegar dumpling sauce was already on the table so I poured myself a saucer-full and placed a single dumpling into the saucer to soak and cool a bit.What happened next was incredible. The dumpling was still hot but I couldn't wait any longer. I put it in my mouth and felt the soup flow in my mouth as I chewed. It was a mix of soy, vinegar, pork juices and sesame. I think the sesame part was pretty unique but maybe that's just how they do it in Singapore. Whatever the reason, I am happy they discovered this combination of flavors because it was a true delight and I would definitely go back.I wolfed down the seven dumplings, walked up to the front of the shop and paid. In case it wasn't clear, I was one happy customer.If you spend enough money, they take Visa. Pay at the front.Total Cost: $13.30 ($9.77 USD)21 Neil RdSingaporeThis post is copy and pasted from my blog of solo travels and solo reviews",ZPK5D5avam3JDdZRsDq_xQ
Jing Hua Xiao Chi,jing-hua-xiao-chi-singapore,"I had the steamed pork dumplings and zha jing noodles. Dumplings were fine, but the noodles where uninspiring and looked and tasted like someone justed scoop something out of a pot that has been sitting all day on  a pile of noodles.",uHP1YPHuqyQ8wAXvAYofrg
Jing Hua Xiao Chi,jing-hua-xiao-chi-singapore,"I can't believe I just recently discovered Jing Hua restaurant. I never walk along this side of Neil Road but one Sunday in search of food or anything even open worth trying around this area, I stumbled upon Jing Hua. It was open, air conditioned, and there wasn't a crowd so I thought I'd give it a try.I was surprised at the number of Yelp reviews mostly raving about Jing Hua. I cracked up as I read through a number of the reviews while ordering and eating my meal. I especially cracked up at Ida's review as there was a twist to the ending where she ordered all that food for herself! I did the same and didn't feel bad about it after seeing her review, haha.The xiao long bao are very good. On par with DTF I'd say. I really enjoyed my hot and sour noodle soup. It's just like regular hot and sour soup but with a nice thick udon-y noodle to help balance out soup with some carbs.The lotus pancake was awesome also. Not the healthiest as it's deep fried but the skin was crispy to perfection and the lotus inside was subtly sweet and added a good gooey texture to go with the crispy skin. I took half home for breakfast the next morning and although not as good fresh, it was still semi-crispy and enjoyable.I'll be back Jing Hua!",hRMpQlJQDObCpNSJ1qd_fA
Jing Hua Xiao Chi,jing-hua-xiao-chi-singapore,Meh. Was better back when it was Qun Zhong. Dumpling skins could have been frozen. Service was so so. Better at hawker stands right up street.,DQmOsTD5NPx5mXwEqb82LQ
Jing Hua Xiao Chi,jing-hua-xiao-chi-singapore,Eh. So mediocre omg. Nothing authentic of this place. What a disappointment. Noodles were like the frozen kind? I don't know. Spinach dish is very boring. Vegetarian dumpling was ok. Xiao long bao is not good not authentic and a bit pricy for what it is at 8sgd for 7 pieces.,0gBy-cIXe0DQKhFjifu68Q
Jing Hua Xiao Chi,jing-hua-xiao-chi-singapore,"Jing Hua is a RIPOFF! You've been warned! With that said, those dumplings are damn good. I suppose it's bc the fillings are oh-so juicy, oh-so porky, and oh-so veg-gy. They don't skimp on the fillings, hence, the hefty price tag. The zhajiang mian (black bean noodle sauce) is nothing to rave about...it's a bit bland, actually. The veggies are also very simple: stir-fried in garlic but $8 for a small portion. Come here if you're really, REALLY craving old-style, mama homemade kind of dumplings. Otherwise, I think the dumpling places found in Maxwell or Chinatown would suffice. For half the price tag. Don't forget, this place is cash only. Boo. Last time I went, we had to dig into our pockets and return the wet napkins ($0.80 a pop) bc we didn't have enough cash. We paid more than $50 for two pax...was that worth the AC and juicy, pork, veg-gy dumplings? Maybe....",3g_vgaCNlvR5uKmUkSz8Rw
Jing Hua Xiao Chi,jing-hua-xiao-chi-singapore,"This is a review of lunch with a friend at Jing Hua Restaurant at the Qun Zhong Eating House.tinyurl.com/m9ec4qpMy friend suggested this restaurant.   With the exception of the hot & sour soup, my friend selected our dishes.Note:  Sometimes I feel unburdened in writing reviews when I do not know a specific cuisine extremely well.  I can simply review whether I enjoy the food or not.  I do not have to get caught up in authenticity or if there is some restaurant down the street that some might think is better.  It is the case for this review.Jing Hua Restaurant at the Qun Zhong Eating House is all about the food.   The service is effective.  It is efficient.  Don't expect them to be coming over and high-fiving you and asking if everything is to your liking.  They are going to take your order sheet.  They are going to verify your order.  They are going to bring you your food.  They are going to do all of this relatively quick.  Then they are going to want you to leave so they can do the same for the next hungry guests.There are the usual checklist sheets for ordering.  There are also helpful reference photo menus.  Compared to some similar restaurants, the menu is not extensive.  But I think this allows them to focus on the quality of the dishes they do serve.tinyurl.com/kzzyvk4tinyurl.com/mp5ldyptinyurl.com/lv2gvvcThe ambiance is very clean and functional.  There is red trim to provide some colour.  The tables are basic (mostly round) red topped tables.  The chairs are those simple and painful folding chairs that get pulled out for school assemblies and such.  There is a front room and a back room.  For our visit (at 1:30 pm on a Friday), the place was initially packed.   By the time we were leaving, it was emptying out.  But their lunch service ends at 3 pm.    It had the bustle of a restaurant where everyone was enjoying their food.  If your group isn't large enough to fill a table, they do communal seating.tinyurl.com/n3ujahatinyurl.com/m7cwmc5The food was all very good to excellent.  It was freshly prepared.  The dishes were also well presented.Lunch Collage Photo:tinyurl.com/om9trxyMinced Pork Noodles - This was a fantastic dish.  It was comfort in a bowl.  For my personal taste, the noodles were perfect.  The flavours were wonderful.  I ate every bite including the greens.tinyurl.com/mg6mx2cPan Fried Pork Dumplings - This was another excellent dish.  They had just the right amount of crispiness.  They were not oily.  The taste just made me want to eat more and more.tinyurl.com/kdj8n4pHot and Sour Soup - I almost decided to lick the bowl.  I was certainly trying to get every last drop out of it.  I would not have minded for it to of had a little bit more spicy heat to it.  Unlike some of the other courses, this is a dish, I have eaten a lot of other versions.  This certainly ranked with some of the better hot and sour soups I've tried.  It was also another very comforting dish.  It would be perfect for a flu day or if it ever snowed in Singapore.tinyurl.com/o5xjtjgLittle Juicy Steamed Meat Dumplings - Just another winner - As soup dumplings go, these were very good.  I just love the explosion of flavour that they provide.  The dumpling itself was well prepared.  Just thin enough to be light and just thick enough to hold together for the sometimes challenging journey to one's mouth.tinyurl.com/o9sds37Receipt (Lunch for two): $39.55 - They only accept cash.tinyurl.com/q7xtdx5Overall - You can tell I like Jing Hua Restaurant at the Qun Zhong Eating House and this is based primarily on the quality of the food.  The remainder of the experience is functional and efficient.  This is probably more of a 4.5 star lunch experience.  But I thought the food was good enough to warrant rounding up.  It is a place I would not hesitate to return to or to recommend to others.",3S53VaMDPy8Lywk2TuPb4A
Jing Hua Xiao Chi,jing-hua-xiao-chi-singapore,"Not bad, not bad. Don't come here for the xiao long bao, they are pretty well priced but taste sort of stale... If that's possible. The pork/seafood pan-fried dumplings, on the other hand, are delectable. The noodle dishes are also quite tasty and well priced.The menu is short, but they seem to do most things well, although I didn't try the desserts, which seemed to be the only items that were overpriced. The place can get crowded on weekends, so best to call ahead. Service is prompt, as it tends to be in these types of places. Location is wonderful for an after-meal stroll, or to grab a drink at a nearby bar.",qnXgtXUvHRn0L0_8SirnWw
Jing Hua Xiao Chi,jing-hua-xiao-chi-singapore,"Today at Qun Zhong (aka Jing Hua), I told myself a real whopper of a tale.  Like a serial cheater tell his or her lover, ""Don't worry baby, I'll never step out on you again"", I told myself, ""Go ahead and over order, don't worry, not like I'm going to finish everything...""Yeah...you can imagine how that actually went over once I tasted the awesome food.  First up were the Xiao Long Bao ($7 for an order of 7).  They were so juicy and delicious with such delicate skins that I rationalized that it would be a crime against all things tasty if I tried to reheat them at home.  I particularly enjoyed biting off the tops, slurping some of the soup, and stuffing each with the homemade chili sauce on the table.Next were the Fried Dumplings ($8 for 10), which were daintily small, blissfully crispy and curiously open on both ends.  I recently read an article in the NY Times on the science of junk food, highlighting the research done by food scientists.  One of the findings was that the ""perfect break point"" in chips is ~4 pounds of pressure per square inch.  The crispy dumpling bottoms must be pretty darn close because I felt entirely blissed out with each crunchy chew.I ordered the Bean Sprouts with Minced Meat Sauce ($8 for a decent sized plate) as a healthier substitute for the noodles with minced meat sauce that I actually wanted, but it actually turned out to be a great choice.  The bean sprouts were simply blanched to retain the natural crunchiness and the minced meat sauce was rich and flavorful.To close out my gluttonous solo feast, I ordered the Lotus Paste Pancake ($9).  I vastly prefer lotus paste to red bean and this pancake massively exceeded my expectations.  Truth be told, I wasn't sure what it would taste like aside from the rave reviews from my fellow yelpers.  Picture a thick layer of filling (red bean or lotus paste) sandwiched between two layers of mochi with a deep fried crust on the outside and then sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds.  Don't be shy to fight for the corner pieces if you are with a large group...they are by far the best!PARTING THOUGHT: I showed at 5:50p on a Sunday and there was no line!  Service was a breeze and the manager was wreathed in smiles and encouraged me to visit again soon!",Ss6Fz9oK7HCOvYllxpdwEw
Jing Hua Xiao Chi,jing-hua-xiao-chi-singapore,"I have found dumpling nirvana.  These steamed or fried dumplings are among my favorite dumplings anywhere (the meat is pork though so keep that in mind unless you get the vegetarian version!)You'll exclaim ""Just one more dumpling"" and eat five...but they are worth it.This small menu doesn't give you many options besides dumplings, noodles, vegetables, and two desserts.  But my oh my, what they do they do DELICIOUSLY!  The decor is surprisingly modern and clean.  While they supposedly take reservations, the staff will look clueless when you ask for your reserved table.  But luckily it doesn't get too packed and a few tables were still available on a Sunday at lunch time.The food:The regular steamed dumplings are simple, but contain a great balance of flavors (not too salty with a great balance of filling to dough).  The fried dumplings are open at each end and are crispy little pockets of goodness.  Another crispy piece of goodness is the Chinese pizza which is essentially the pork filling in a large sesame bun - mmm, did I just order a dumpling on steroids?  The soup dumplings are delicate and flavorful while the vegetarian dumplings had a mild, but nice combination of vegetables.  I thought the two noodle dishes - the cha jeong noodles and shanghai style with pork strips and preserved vegetables were consistently good, but not the best noodles in town.  The red bean in sesame pancake was also a surprising favorite.  I loved the crispy, thin layers over the warm red bean paste.I'm really glad I came here with a group and got to try most dishes.  It only took me one visit to convince me that this is one of the best dumplings places in town.  I'd readily eat all of the dumplings again...and happily accept the dumpling food coma thereafter.",bWYTvHxF8MO4k_Anqf5nPQ
Jing Hua Xiao Chi,jing-hua-xiao-chi-singapore,"Oops...the skin of the Xiao Long Bao broke apart as I attempted to pick it up very cautiously, and the beautiful guts spilled out uncontrollably onto the parchment paper. This is both a good and bad sign; the good thing is that the skin is delicate and the bad sign is that I am too rowdy with this plump meaty babies.These  Xiao Long Baos ($7++ for 7pcs) are near perfect--the ball of minced pork at the center, loose and yielding, as if itself in midmelt. My 2nd XLB landed in my spoon intact and buoyant, and I popped the entire thing comfortably in my mouth. There could be a little more of that liquefied pork gelatin but I'm just being greedy. Other dumplings variations include the steamed vegetarian dumplings stuffed with taupok bits and crunchy turnips which even non-vegetarians will delight. The Seafood and Pork Dumplings had a slightly chewy feel but the ingredients tasted fresh and not too greasy. I prefer the pan-fried version ($8++ for 10 pieces) which transformed the original chewy skin into delicate crunchy bites with tantalizing burnt aroma. This gives the pan-fried dumpling more character, as if it was a  golden pillow case Perfect if there were more chives. The mastery achievement goes beyond the dumplings to the noodles and the desserts. The Noodle with Minced Pork & Soya Bean Sauce 炸酱面 ($5++), is wonderfully alchemized by the minced pork and age-old calculus soya bean paste that Iess salty than other specimens. The Osmanthus soup with glutinous rice ball soup ($3++) arrived hot and fragrant with warm floral inhalations. Hand-made with a spot-on dough-to-filling ratio, each tiny pop is rolled with a different flavour; lotus and walnut, black sesame, red bean and peanuts.  Another must-try is the Crispy Red Bean Pancake ($10++) that is prepared freshly upon order. Expertly deep-fried till they are like crunchy fritters, the dark brown parcels oozes dense, sweet red bean paste with charred sesame aroma. After such a satisfying meal, I am convinced that the Han's decision to leave the menu unchanged for 25 years was a right one. Consistent quality food that can stand the test of time. Sounds unbelievable in our modern age but here is a true story.",dJzKwp5k65MK3R_qn4Xpow
Jing Hua Xiao Chi,jing-hua-xiao-chi-singapore,"An institution along Neil road, Qun Zhong has recently been renovated and now occupies two unites.

However, the legendary grouchy elderly man at the door is still there and continues to handle crowd control with impatience and a frown.This one of those restaurants with an extremely small menu, and even then there are overlaps between dishes because sauces and fillings are re-used. However, by focusing on just a few, they've really boiled it down to the dishes they've best at and famous for, and everything is absolutely delicious, although I am not a fan of the Chinese pizza. The xiao long bao are not as dainty and refined as the ones you would find elsewhere, but they are hearty and pack great flavour. My personal favourite dish, however, is their pan-fried dumpling.

Jing Hua Xiao Chi,jing-hua-xiao-chi-singapore,"I had a really unusual experience at Jing Hua tonight. We arrived for dinner at 7pm (on a Tuesday night) and there was no queue. In fact, half the tables were gloriously empty. I had been told there would be a wait at all hours, bad service but the most ridiculously delicious dumplings in Singapore. Well, the service was actually decent and attentive by both Singapore and authentic Chinese restaurant standards (I can't say which is supposed to be worse). I didn't encounter the grumpy boss and we were seated immediately.We ordered the xiao long bao, guo tie, spinach with oyster sauce, zha jiang mian and red bean pancake. The xiao long bao was as it should be, meaning perfectly hot with lots of soup inside and a good amount of pork and seafood. Divine. The guo tie was similarly awesome - fried to crisp but served on a dry plate with none of that leaky oil puddle crap you get at alot of la mian hawker stalls. The spinach dish was generous and not salty at all and the zha jiang mian, oh what mian. Soft noodles, bowl-lickin' sauce and a good dash of crisp cucumber shreds and spinach.There was nothing bad to say about our experience (well maybe the $0.60 I had to pay for unused wet towels that couldn't be returned) and I intend to return many more times.

The Curry Culture,the-curry-culture-singapore,"This joint brings you higher end (and higher price) Indian food than what you'd normally get.The lamb samosa was a large Punjabi style one, chock-full of minced meat. It was crispy and quite flaky.The chicken mulligatawny soup was both sour and salty. I'm not sure how to describe it but it had a pleasant taste. Then was Bharwan aatish khumbh - tandoori Mushrooms with nuts and cheese. It had a wonderful mix of flavours and a rich nutty taste. It was a bit sweet - which the manager had informed us about when we ordered. So it's not for everyone.We also had the murgh korma - chicken in a slightly sweet, mild rose cashew sauce. I was surprised by how mild it was. It seemingly had no chilli, and just a bit of pepper. I could even taste the rose. It was very pleasant and more subtle than Indian food usually is (though it'll probably be derided by purists). One thing to note is that a good cut of chicken was used, whereas lower end Indian places use cheaper cuts. This isn't necessarily a good thing, since the meat loses some moistness and flavour.To accompany our dishes we had butter roti and lachhna paratha (layered paratha). They were pretty good but they were not hot and the former did not have any palpable liquefied butter. In short, they were a bit old. I told the manager who claimed all the food was made only upon ordering. Well...We also had mango lassi which was excellent with a very intense mango taste.The service was not so good unfortunately. I asked for water and the server forgot. Only when I told the manager did it come. The mushrooms also only came upon my reminding the staff.

The Curry Culture,the-curry-culture-singapore,"I was visiting Singapore on a conference trip and had craving for some Indian food. After reading lots of great reviews about this place, we decided to dine here on a Friday night. Getting reservation was easy as we were here an hour before it's closing time. We were seated promptly outside and the server was quick enough to take our orders. We had samosa and papdi chaat as our appetizers. The papdi chaat was better of the two.. very tasty with right amount of tanginess, spices and chilly! The samosa was also good but I enjoyed the chaat more. I often judge an Indian restaurant by the kind of chaats they make. I was in the mood of having some cocktail which will be spicy yet having the good liquor .. the waiter knew perfectly my want and served me the India summer- cocktail with whiskey and spices.. it was the perfect drink I needed on a Friday night. A must try drink if you enjoy some spices! The main course- aloo paratha, Channa masala, tandoori roti and aloo gobi was spot on.. very tasty, flavorful and true to its kind. Definitely fabulous dining experience. The service was excellent and a perfect ambience to have dinner with friends. Next time will love to try non- veg dishes as they seem to be excellent!",kwDFW024bbAd4O3YcwACcA

Murugan Idli Shop,murugan-idli-shop-singapore,"Idlis are fluffy south indian rice cakes. The process for making them is simple - you prepare a batter made of grounded rice and lentils, leave the batter overnight to ferment, and then cook the batter into small fluffy cakes. Simple, no? While it may be easy to make okay idlis, it is extremely hard to make exceptional idlis. In most places, the idlis are either too hard, or too sticky, or too fluffy. Getting that right balance is very, very hard. But the chefs at this tiny hole in the wall have mastered it. It wouldn't be an exaggeration for me to say that I've had the best idlis here outside of India.When you enter the shop, the waiter will bring you a banana leaf ""plate"" adorned with four different types of chutneys. Typically, it's coconut, mint, coriander and groundnut. The chutneys are very flavorful and freshly prepared. You place your order by marking the number of idlis, dosas, your regular south indian fare on a piece of paper and then sit back, relax and enjoy the meal. If you lick the chutneys clean off the plate, you can always ask for more. We visited this place twice during our stay in Singapore and got Idli, Onion Rava Dosai and Set Meals (Sambhar Rice, Lemon Rice and Curd Rice). Everything was fantastic in terms of taste.The only unfortunate thing is that this place cannot handle large crowds. There are only one or two folks waiting the tables and when pummeled with a big crowd of hungry patrons, these folks just simply give up. During one such rush period, we had to wait for half an hour just for someone to come take our order. I can understand that waiting is inevitable, but allowing patrons to sit down at a table and avoiding their calls and gestures is not the solution. Perhaps, they can have proper wait-lists or at least reassure patrons rather than ignoring them. Oh well, I won't complain too much because they are just understaffed when faced with large crowds and the food is so good! Just for their sake, I hope they can handle this better so that they don't lose customers.",A-ac-5NVNQ94jQ8jn63BVA

Firstly, the tables weren't wiped properly, I had to ask someone twice to give us the menu to place the order. Second, we had a toddler with us and he wasn't given a plate and when I asked for a small plate they said we don't have it. They could have arranged something for a 2 year old! Third, I had to wave my hands to place top up order, ask for more chutney and finally our coffee took almost 15 mins to be served. The icing on the cake was that when I went to pay the bill they had charged less money for what we had ordered and I had to stand there and correct her and tell her that I should be charged more.

And given that Five Star is of closest proximity to my abode, it's no wonder that this is my first pick when poultry cravings hit. Cool, silky tender chicken atop a mound of soy sauce and sesame oil drenched cucumbers. Hot, fragrant rice. Spicy, garlicky chili. A generous serve of steaming soup. There's nothing missing in this picture, really. Sure, it's as unglamorous as they come - sitting out next to a busy road with auntie waitresses squawking orders overhead, but the bustling ambience of being in the presence of famous food is unbeatable.

Ordered their roasted chicken for two and had the hong kong kailan (the one with oyster sauce). It was a great meal. The clear soup wasn't bland, so it actually added flavor to the rice. The chili and garlic were great too. the kampong chicken was succulent and juicy, the rice was fluffy and not hard / dry. The kailan was sliced thinly, so it's not a chore to eat the stems. And the oyster sauce was generous. It was a great lunch, except for one gripe. The lady kept taking away our chili / garlic and putting it on a different table. Yaaaa I mean we've taken some in our saucers, but then every time we wanted more, we'd have to call for service for her to take the tray back to our table, then she'd take it away again. And so we had to ask for it again afterwards. So I just gave up. Haha. Sad. But that's the only thing stopping me from giving it a 5 star.

Many cafes and restaurants come and go, and we were excited to try something new.D' Good Cafe caught our attention when we realize we could enter by the ""back door"". Climbed up the stairs and it felt like we entered another world all together. The lighting done right, adorable decor all around. Suits the hipsters and young students.We were told to pick up the menu and find a seat. It's a self service place where you place your order, make your payment and will be issued a pager to pick up your food when it's ready. We ordered a tea time meal which comes with an orange juice (there are other options) and a waffle. Initially I was expecting a full waffle unfortunate it turned it to be half a waffle. Urgh. Who got the other half! Anyway, i ordered a green tea matcha frappe thingy. It was absolutely delicious. It's been awhile since I drank a decent cup of green tea frappe. The price is fairly affordable and hence the throngs of students. The upper floor was really pretty however was super turned off when I saw the whole area filled with students on their laptop and notes. Almost felt like a classroom or tuition centre. We were on the 2nd floor which didn't have any students mugging but still had dating students cuddling on swings and cozy seats. Overall, a nice stopover for an affordable and delicious tea break. Strong air conditioning is definitely a plus too.",qqZzCpD70nRd-UilsywRQA
d’Good Cafe,d-good-cafe-singapore,"I'm one of those weird folks who doesn't drink coffee at all, yet love visiting cafes and bistros, especially the indie ones that are popping up around town faster than I can ever keep up.I've read about D'Good Cafe and have been curious and eager to try it out, glad to finally get the chance to do so on a Saturday afternoon after running some errands at Holland Village. Located on the the 2nd and 3rd floors amidst a bustling stretch of banks and F&B establishments, one would most certainly miss this if you weren't specifically looking for it. Look for The Body Shop, and then make your way up that narrow stairway next to it.Once you enter, it's a whole different world up there! The ordering counter is on Level 2, so place your orders here, then look for a table either on the other side of Level 2 (grab the lovely swing seats with a view if you're lucky enough); or head up to Level 3 attic for more seats, incl. a tiny outdoor patio (seats under a tent) if it's not too warm. And who would have guessed that they even have a little lift (yes elevator!) right inside the unit? You got to try it just for the fun of it, it's operated via a ""press and hold"" button inside the lift, maximum capacity of 4 :)We were here only for drinks - Mocha was good, Long Black was strong (a tad sour), reasonably priced between S$5 - 6 each. Don't make the same mistake I did though, I didn't check the price and ordered a simple ""Brewed Tea"" (since I don't take coffee), which turned out to be a TWG teabag in a small pot of hot water, no milk or cream provided... and that came up to S$7!! How on earth did my plain teabag cost more than the coffee, I just couldn't figure it out. But ouch!Service was bleh, the guy who took our order was sulky and not the least welcoming, fortunately the thoughtful cute decorations and detailed aesthetics sprinkled all around made up for that lack of service. All in all, a cute little hidden treasure, just save yourself some bucks, don't order the brewed tea.",G9RwoBoxPGZmYTNPTLv_IQ
d’Good Cafe,d-good-cafe-singapore,"Spotted this cafe while walking around holland village area in search of food for dinner. From the outside it looks like a plain building. Need to climb a flight of stairs to get to the counter where you will be ordering your foods and drinks. Seating area there is one on second floor and one on the third floor. There is a lift that brings you up and down in case you do not want your serving trays to spill over while climbing on the steps.Seating area is rather small for a cafe but have to admit that the second floor interior design was good. It has the outdoors components inside. Third floor is just more like office hang out interior design. There are a number of staffs working but you need to self serve but they will clear your plate away. Food wise, I had a portebello pasta (mushroom pasta) in cream sauce. Price wise it's a bit on the higher end. I'm a little disappointed with the pasta as the sauce is dry and there is not much taste to it. My friend who had bacon carbonara commented the same.I am not sure how the coffee tasted here as I cannot drink coffee. There are a few selection of TWG teas in packets and Arizona teas in the bottle. Overall it is a nice concept for a cafe and it is good environment to hang out with friends. Next time round I will order their bake goods instead.",Qr-WoW6Vye4aH3I-YZ2ZyQ
d’Good Cafe,d-good-cafe-singapore,"Purely based on quality of food and drinks, 3.5 at most, but additional 0.5 stars for the free wifi. This cafe is quietly tucked away on the second and third levels of one of the shophouses in holland village. I came here on a weekday afternoon and easily got a seat. I love how this cafe offers free wifi. It's getting harder to find cafés with free wifi in Singapore to prevent customers from staying excessively long but I that similarly deters me from visiting them! My order was taken by a pleasant and good-natured barista who recommended the tea time set. This is basically a drink (lattes etc) and a slice of one of the featured cakes for a price of $6.50. My mocha alone would have cost $5.80. This cafe serves up a decent cup of mocha. It was aromatic and flavorful, and the chocolate was not overwhelming. The Oreo cheesecake on the other hand was a disappointment. While the tea set does come across as a good deal, I would pass on the dessert the next time round.",as58wHUswAr9TLmo21js0Q
d’Good Cafe,d-good-cafe-singapore,"Espresso - a small volume of potent coffee, partially covered with a medium brown crema. There were some citrus notes, but they were secondary to the intense bitterness which followed in the aftertaste, and which lingered long after the shot had been finished. The bitterness is dominant in this shot, with some harsh elements present also. This may not be an issue for pour over coffees, or americanos, where the end product is diluted with hot water, however an espresso shot is more concentrated, which can exacerbate harsh notes. There are a number of different types of coffee beans available however, and D'Good offers customers the option of choosing their own preferred type. It may be advisable to highlight this more prominently at the ordering counter though - it is certainly a selling point that not all cafe's in the area offer. Cappuccino - there are some large bubbles present in the foam, but not in sufficient quantities to affect the texture. The latte art is nicely executed also. The mouthfeel is dominated by the texture and taste of warm milk, rather than the hybrid of milk and microfoam that can work in conjunction to form a smooth hybrid of taste and texture. The flavour of the underlying espresso shot is somewhat diluted by the milk, but the bitter aftertaste is still discernible. This may be entirely subjective, but the intense citrusy bitterness described above may work better with pour over coffee, rather than with milk based drinks. However, as there are a number of bean varieties available, and the ability to customise drinks, this can quite easily be fixed, and may not even be an issue from week to week.Staff are friendly and accomodating to requests, noticing when customers are looking for sugar or water, and stepping in to help. Also, thought and effort has clearly gone into the decor and layout, with an intelligent use of space allowing for lots of seating space, as well as a very pleasant al fresco area on the upper level. Busy periods can cause delays however (just as they would in any cafe), with a delay in used cups and plates being cleared, and tables being cleaned. Staff seem clustered in the kitchen and ordering counter area instead, but it should be noted that they did collect plates from the upper level before the end of my visit. Increasing the frequency of staff checks on the upper level may help.The ordering counter can become crowded, and as a result customers collect drinks after they have been prepared. This may be to keep the ordering counter clear, but one minor issue is that drinks can be slightly less warm when the are collected. This is a minor issue though, keeping the ordering counter and roasting space clear is a good reason for doing so. At $14.50 for a single espresso and 2 cappuccinos, the prices are about right. There is also a selection of cakes and baked items available, as well as syphon and pour over coffee.Overall, this is not a bad cafe by any means, with some admirable traits - a good selection of beans and brewing methods, and a micro roastery - everything I look for in a quality cafe, and I genuinely want D'Good to succeed. With some minor changes to the beans used for different drinks, and to the frequency of checks on the upper levels, this could be a very good cafe in a great location.",2aJZEdicQUqqOQG5-pwe-Q
d’Good Cafe,d-good-cafe-singapore,"The cafe has a warm and cozy atmosphere on the second floor.  It's third floor is dedicated for people studying and planning on squatting for a while. The cutest part is a swing where you can enjoy your coffee/food while looking out on the street. The coffee is typical ""cafe coffee"" but the food is pretty good. Even though it doesn't leave the deepest impression, I find myself frequenting it often because it's reliable, cozy, and right next to the Holland V mrt.It's often busy so make sure you check to see if there are seats that you like before ordering your coffee/food.",J0hk2P4jO3ZjzZUJjJKRnQ
d’Good Cafe,d-good-cafe-singapore,"D'Good Cafe is a whimsical spot to swing your worries away, right smack in the heart of Holland Village. It sits in a funky shop house unit that has 2 entrances and the layout reminded me of that children story about a house in a boot with many children (uh huh i really don't have much of a childhood).D'Good Cafe specializes in single-origin coffee beans, which are roasted in-house. The owner is some crazy coffee fanatic and you can get your Ethiopian, Guatemalan, Jamaican beans done the siphon, drip, pour-over or espresso way. You wouldn't be able to miss the Elektra espresso machine at the counter! If you're up for something more exotic, there's the famous Kopi Luwak (civet coffee) from the Wahana Estate in Sumatra for $38 a pop. You can also make your own blend here at D'Good Cafe too.Here's what we had. The Prawn Aglio Olio ($16) was a little on the dry side, especially after it cooled a little (it became clumpy). I thought it could use a little more salt but it's certainly quite well flavored. The prawns were nicely done and crunchy.I liked the Bacon Carbonara ($15) more than the previous pasta. It's creamy (more on the milky side) and certainly more satisfying (only if you like cream). Generous portions of bacon too. It would be perfect with some fried bacon bit and an egg.The Eggs Benedict ($13.50) was a sad sad portion. I was terribly disappointed by it in fact. The brioche was nice but was too thinly sliced. As a result, it was soaked through by the eggs. Too much vinegar was used in poaching the eggs and that contributed to the papery texture of the whites and that acidic taste. Holladaise sauce was weak too. Certainly not something i'd recommend ordering. Add on $3 to the breakfast sets for a Latte that is well balanced with a nice crema. I must say we were all happy with our choice of caffeine. The Earl Grey Lavender Latte ($7) was aromatic without being overpowering. I'm fearful of lavender because it just smells and tastes a little like air freshener but this was just right. The Caramel Hot Chocolate ($7.50) will satisfy your sweet tooth because it's on the sweet side but i found the chocolate a tad artificial. The foam had somewhat of a brulee texture which was interesting. And if you like latte art, they do a lot of cute animal prints.We concluded that the best part of the meal was the maple sea salt cheesecake ($9). You cannot miss this smokey sweet and creamy cheesecake. The cheese was rich but not too heavy and it went perfectly with the crunchy and compact graham crust. I suspect a lot of butter went into it but it's awesome. Repeat after me: Butter is awesome (especially salted ones).D'Good Cafe also has a rooftop area for alfresco dining. This would be perfect at night or on an extremely cool day. Pretty isn't it?I'd certainly be back for more cheesecake. Tried the Strawberry Cheesecake and it just didn't cut it after the mindblowingly good maple sea salt one. Enjoy this one!",4WlVklOsSd409skDsWwQkQ
d’Good Cafe,d-good-cafe-singapore,"This is one of our favorite cafe.  Good coffee with lovely latte art.  Each cup comes with a different design.  The menu expends every now and then which is awesome.  There's something new to try when one feels adventurous than ordering the usual.  Egg Benedict is yummy and the eggs are cooked perfectly each time.   The seafood lobster bisque is one of my favorite.  The soup is delicious and licked clean every time.  Be Careful though if you come with a few friends and order all at once.  They sometimes will group your order together before buzzing your pager, so food could get cold while ""waiting"".  Their strawberry ice cream is super creamy and yummy!  They wouldn't tell me where they got it from.  Dang it!   Chocolate lava cake is heavenly by itself or with the strawberry ice cream  d'good is a self service cafe and they get quite busy on the weekend.",wEzjzGIrosldGywLy8dFKg

Tandoori Corner North Indian Curry House,tandoori-corner-north-indian-curry-house-singapore,"Being an habitué of travel to India, I was pleased to find a North Indian restaurant in my neighbourhood. You always know the food is going to be authentic when they not only have Kingfisher beer on the menu, but also Kingfisher Strong. Tandoori Corner did not disappoint. The food was excellent. I greatly enjoyed the murgh malai tikka, fish tikka and their assortment of naans. The tikka dishes were note-worthy, and the accompanying mint sauce was as authentic as you can get. I was instantly transported to my favourite spot in Delhi! It certainly is pricey in comparison to other eating places in Balestier. We paid slightly over S$40 for two. It was, however, a real treat and a nice change from the usual fare in Balestier. My only real gripe about this place is the set-up. Situated next to a clinic in Balestier Plaza, there is no indoor sitting space and the tables have been placed along the corridors of the neighbourhood mall.

Momma Kong’s Crab Shack,momma-kongs-crab-shack-singapore,"Found this restaurant by surfing on the web. Ordered the Singapore infamous Red Chili Crab, man tao and dou miao (green veggies).Unlike the cooked food stall, there's a fixed price for the crab instead of charging by weight. Also, this restaurant has a good reputation that no MSG will be added to any of the food.Long waited the infamous Red Chili Crab was finally arrived. The crab was in decent size. The presentation was nice. I first worried about the red chili sauce would be too spicy. Actually it wasn't so bad. It's a mixture of sour and spicy and the level of spiciness was kind of in the middle. It was very good. This is a must eat dish in here.Mantau was a deep fried steam roll. It is slightly sweet. It has a wonderful texture of the crispiness on the outside shell and softness in the inside of the mantau.Dou miao is fresh.Other than the dishes.

Momma Kong’s Crab Shack,momma-kongs-crab-shack-singapore,"When in Singapore you MUST get crab. Well, unless you're deathly allergic, then maybe not. But for everyone else, Chili Crab is a must. I was told a story that Singapore is green because it apparently looks like a crab and a brown crab is an unhealthy crab so they decided to plant many trees to make it a green crab. It's alive!I think I missed some of the parts to that story, but nevertheless, crab is a really important part of Singapore for all tourists. It's not too hard to find places that serve Chili Crab and they're usually swarming with tourists. Crab is also super expensive but I figured it was worth the splurge as long as I could get a review out of the trip.I decided to go to Mama Kong's because it was recommended to me by a Singaporean friend. I had tried to go last year and was turned away because I didn't have a reservation. I wasn't about to make the same mistake this time and booked a reservation for 5pm -- table for one!The restaurant is small with seating both indoors and outdoors, It's a clean, sit down restaurant with a cozy vibe. Very different from the Chili Crab places about a block away. Reservations were made online and they have a rewards program, but since I don't live here I didn't sign up. I had had Chili Crab before at a tourist trap and it was awesome so I was expecting good things.The Black Pepper crab is ""The Original"" crab that is most recommended here. I was told it was spicy so I decided to get the classic Red Chilli (spelling it how it's spelled on the menu) instead. It's advertised as your basic Chili Crab, but Mama Kong's style. Both crabs were priced at $50 ($36.67 USD), so it didn't make a difference in terms of budget. Again, crab is always expensive in Singapore. It's probably possible to find cheaper crab, though.I was parched and got an apple juice, as well. It was $6 ($4.40 USD) and it literally tasted like apple juice, so I wouldn't say this was special by any means. It was definitely over priced but whatever, I needed something to drink and Mama Kong's didn't have a special drink that I was dying to try.The apple juice came first, followed by the Chili Crab shortly after. The crab was huge and I also ordered Fried Mantou for $3 ($2.20 USD) which is commonly served with Chili Crab. The Fried Mantou were so good! They were a bit heavy for me so I didn't eat all of them, but while they may have been unhealthy, they were also very delicious. I dipped the bread into the Chili sauce and enjoyed.The crab came pre-cracked. They have a de-shelling service but I didn't need it. I made piles of crab meat on the small plate they provided. I then put the meat onto the big spoon and scooped some Chili Sauce. The crab meat was juicy and there was a decent amount. The Chili sauce was sweet with a strong kick. I don't like spice so it was borderline too much for me, but I was pretty happy overall. It didn't go too well with the apple juice, though. Next time, I'll opt for a water.The restaurant was pretty empty while I was there but it's probably because I got there so early. The waiters asked to take a photo of me and gave me a copy with my check. The service was good and every one was super nice.I think Mama Kong's is a great place to go if you're looking for Chili Crab and you want a nice, cozy ambience. However, the actual quality of the crab was similar to that of the crab I've had a tourist traps and the crab overall was a bit too pricey for what it was. Plus, the $6 apple juice really threw me off.TOTAL COST: $70.05 ($51.38 USD)34 Mosque StSingaporeThis review is copy and pasted from my blog of solo travels and solo reviews.",ZPK5D5avam3JDdZRsDq_xQ
Momma Kong’s Crab Shack,momma-kongs-crab-shack-singapore,"My wife and I visited Singapore for the first time after Christmas, following a trip to the Philippines to attend a major family event, and we made it a point to sample some of Singapore's signature dishes. We tried Hainanese Chicken Rice our first night and Fish Head Curry from Banana Leaf Apolo the following day. For our last full day in Singapore, we headed out to Chinatown to try Chili Crab at Momma Kong's.Our initial research pointed to No Signboard Seafood as the place to get chili crab. However, recent reviews of No Signboard Seafood point to a decline in dining experience so we decided to give Momma Kong's a try.Reservations are highly recommended as the place was quite popular and cozy, with indoor and limited outdoor seating. Even in late December, it was hot and humid in Singapore and indoor seating with AC is preferable. We made a reservation for 2 for 5:00 PM, right when they open. They must get busy since we were informed they have a 7:00 PM reservation for the same table and they hoped we would be done by then. I was a bit put off by that but I knew we would not be lingering that long so no harm no foul.I ordered the red chili crab (Sri Lankan mud crab fresh flown daily - at least that's their claim) with jasmine rice. My wife, a self-proclaimed ""lazy eater"" opted for the prawn fried rice. For starters we shared the fried tofu chips with a zesty tomato-based dipping sauce. To round out our order, we ordered fried mantou and a couple of refreshing calamansi juices (on the menu as lime juice).The chili crab was the unquestioned highlight of our dinner...and it got messy. The chili gravy wasn't spicy and even had a hint of sweetness. The crab was fresh and I had to work to extract the meat...for the both of us. They can de-shell the crab for a fee ($15?)...but where's the fun in that? Needless to say, I used multiple napkins (so rare to find napkins in restaurants in Singapore) during dinner. The prawn fried rice was good as well as were the fried mantous. The fried tofu chips were also a hit. Based on food alone, we were inclined to give this place 5 stars. However, I rate on the entire dining experience.So what were the negatives? For starters, we didn't ask for but we were served these coated peanuts. They were OK...nothing special. We thought they were complimentary only to find out we were charged $2 SGD (Singapore Dollars) for them. We also used the wet napkins on the table (of course...this was a crab place and it gets messy)...and was charged $0.60 SGD for them. Oh yeah, we also found out they added a 10% Service Charge for a dinner for 2! I just can't help but feel like we were being nickeled and dimed for what already was a relatively expensive meal...just took away from the experience.Dinner for 2 came out to just under $108 SGD...or about $75 (US) in ""real"" money.",HKs-w5BWgyKIjpSfguSO2Q

Momma Kong’s Crab Shack,momma-kongs-crab-shack-singapore,"As today marks my one year anniversary of living in the little red dot I will review my favorite place to eat one of Singapore's signature dishes: Crab!I've tried Jumbo, No Signboard & Longbeach but this is the place I take all my visiting friends to eat crab. Momma Kong's might not have the ""authentic"" feel of No Signboard in Geylang or the history of Longbeach but their service is great, the staff is super friendly so it means that I don't have to deal with the grumpy, non-English speaking, ""I don't wanna serve filipino helpers"" auntie to enjoy my crab fix.The crab dishes are on par or even better than the previously mentioned restaurants and I love their mantou, they must have the prettiest and fluffiest mantou of all.Except for the chili crab, I've tried also tried the crab beehoon & pepper crab which are all good but my favorite is the steamed crab: this fantastic dish displays the freshness and glory of crab in all it's simplicity. Yes, simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication!Highly recommended!**Additional bonus points are granted for the fact that they offer to de-shell your crab (for 15$ a pop) so little bananas like me don't need to get their fingers dirty.",9tliQ8H9xcGN8iVl55nx_g
Momma Kong’s Crab Shack,momma-kongs-crab-shack-singapore,"I wanted to try chilli crab during my visit to Singapore, it being the national dish of the country and all. I wasn't really sure where to go. Lonely Planet actually recommended this place and it wasn't too far from where I was staying in Chinatown. This restaurant also has a new modern look to it, compared to some of the other places on the same street. And the staff is really young. I was seated outside (which was disappointing cuz it's hot outside and there are mosquitos!), but I didn't have a reservation and they recommend that you do that in advance. They offer a lot on the menu - not just crab, but stingray and other plates as well. I ordered the chilli crab cuz that's what I came for. I added on the steamed mantou too, since everybody recommended getting that to dip into the chilli sauce. The crab was delicious! Some of the tastiest crab I've ever had. And the sauce was really good. It was spicy and had a nice kick to it, but it wasn't overly spicy. Really good flavor. They provide you with a crab cracker tool, a little bucket, a little silver stick to help you scoop out more meat, and a moist towelette. All the things you could possibly need. More towelettes and napkins would've been nice though (I had to dig into my own supply; bring your own moist towelettes/wet tissues with you if you can! Eating chilli crab is messy!). They also charged for the moist towelette. And they charged me for the little fish side dish they gave me, which I hardly touched. Overall, delicious chilli crab! Yum!",_uwuKDqYXnTM2qrpcs3P2w
Momma Kong’s Crab Shack,momma-kongs-crab-shack-singapore,"Came here with my family, as it was a recommended spot to have chili crabs in SG.We ordered a ton of stuff... but I specifically ordered the chili crab, steamed and fried buns, and tofu chips.Chili Crab - star of the show! This was so delicious in every aspect. The crab was giant, and the sweetness of the meat was still there... even with the excessive chili sauce. The sauce was thick, and perfectly seasoned. I literally mopped up every drop of sauce with those delicious fried buns.Tofu Chips/Fries - not sure what compelled me to order these. I'm not a big fan of tofu on its own. But fried, they sounded interesting. The server also recommended them stating they were popular. I wasn't impressed. They weren't at all crunchy on the outside. It was just deep fried, spongy, tofu sticks. Soggy outside, spongy inside. Very bland.The service was kind of eh... we were rushed from the second we walked in. They greeted us, and informed us that a large reserved party was due to arrive within the hour. They were only willing to seat us if we could finish in under an hour... why didn't they just lock the doors and wait for that large party then?...",zpy5xm3Z9VXK-MZ3_bgo-g
Momma Kong’s Crab Shack,momma-kongs-crab-shack-singapore,"What to do in Singapore if not eating their famous chili crab? We tried to find a place that is far from the limelights but still do good chili crab, and the answer was right there in our own neighborhood ( we stayed in Chinatown ). Momma Kong's was just a few walks away from our hotel and it looked pretty decent joint, a small-ish one but with good reviews, so we went in. We didn't take the package (you should if you're a big eater, we found out later that the package for two people is really good deal), but we ordered one crab each, the black pepper and the chili one and a set of steamed mantou to wipe all those delicious crab broth away.The crabs were super delicious and we were super happy. I had problems with cracking the claws but the staff spotted it right away and helped with it. My boyfriend who never had such large crab experience before also dove right in without any problem. My chili crab was perfect with the perfect amount of burn and the black pepper was super delicious. The bill came at around 75 dollars or so, so it was almost the same price with the package ( I believe the package is without drinks, and alcohol is quite pricey in Singapore) and we had beers, so if you think you can eat a lot, go for the package.I would definitely go back to this place if I had time next time. I am still thinking about the chili crab these days....and do book a table online, they can be a bit busy!",R0Ko9rVnXc3M_23UzGkgjA
Momma Kong’s Crab Shack,momma-kongs-crab-shack-singapore,"Came here twice in a week! It's a good chili crab place that's clean and has AC! The staff is really nice and helpful as well. Prices are about average from what I've seen in Singapore, S$50 per crab. They have other flavors besides the famous red chili crab. They have side dishes as well, which seemed a bit over price to me. We tried the tofu fries - which came with a spicy chili dipping sauce, it was alright! I would definitely just focus on the crab. It depends on hungry you are, but it seems like one crab per person is the norm if that's going to be your main meal. Butter crab was a bit bland (so good for those who can't handle the heat), and pepper crab (the OG Momma Kong's crab) was too peppery (?). The red chili crab still my favorite, sweet, savory, and spicy. **TIP: try the steamed mantou buns. They're super soft and fluffy, and helps to soak up all the delicious crab roe and gravy.",9HFDd8KWXNrQJ4mBKGr9lA

Momma Kong’s Crab Shack,momma-kongs-crab-shack-singapore,"I would say: it's crap.The only reason we stopped here was to have a quick drink and perhaps a quick snack. We opted for the fried chicken chunks and fried calamari, not such an adventurous choice I admit. The tonic water I ordered came garnished with a nice stick of cucumber (as often seen in Gin and Tonic). I nibbled on that one first only vaguely registering something odd. The I began to sip the drink and I realised it actually was a Gin and Tonic, even though I can still hear the waiter say: 'one tonic water'. Quickly fixed. No hassle later with the check. The crispy chicken chunks weren't very crispy nor very chunky. They were actually not nice at all!When we ordered I thought the calamari wouldn't be nice but it turned out those actually were nice. More like thin and crispy  tempura than a thick layer of tasteless batter.

We requested to be seated indoors as outside seating was on a patio sidewalk and I wasn't about to endure the hot humid weather while eating this spicy meal.Our order included the crab, bread, and a scallop appetizer. I'd skip on the scallop and bacon appetizer as it wasn't a great combo. Bacon is usually good on anything, just not on scallops. The bread was nothing like I had before! It had a crispy twisted exterior but when you break it open, steam releases and visible is this soft cloud-like fluff! Whoa, I didn't see that one coming! On to the crab, it's not a huge one but the winner is the curry. The spice is really well balanced with the egg mixture and is manageable even for those who can't handle too much kick.This may be the beginning of a chili crab addiction..",IIFUSAByx3fLmpe4h8tJ4g
Momma Kong’s Crab Shack,momma-kongs-crab-shack-singapore,"Came here with foodie sister after her recommendations. Ordered bee hoon crab and decided to try something different with peranakan crab this time. Added a stingray and shanghai greens. Originally ordered a dou miao too but ad they totally forgot to place our second order, we decided to skip that. My sis, mum and bro in law have been here a couple times and raved about the bee hoon crab and butter crab. According to them the chilli crab which was supposed to be their best seller was so so. They had a not so great experience with sotong last time so decided to give the stingray a try this time. The bee hoon crab was cooked with bee hoon soup. Soup broth was milky and sweet. Very delicious. Crab was very fresh. Peranakan crab was so so. Found the sauce to be aromatic but lacking in taste and a tad too oily. Crab tastes great. Fried mantou was very good but slighlty oily. Stingray was bad. Tasted like they steamed or boiled the stingray first and just grilled it a little in oven with leaf and chilli. The sambal was also very weak in taste. Worst sting ray i ever had. Stingray had a fishy smell. My bil who had blocked nose was only one who could eat it. Shanghai greens was meh. Totally meh. Just fried with garlic and not enough salt. Conclusion: they are only good with their crabs. And honestly quite upset with their service as they missed out part 2 of our order which is the peranakan crab and veg and barely an apology.",LQDpdzndiQ8cJqFPVz7owA

Momma Kong’s Crab Shack,momma-kongs-crab-shack-singapore,"My mother and my best friend love crabs, so very often I end up eating with my mother, my best friend, and her husband at places that specialise or feature crabs.JUMBO.

And this actually was the meal that inspired me to bring my best friend to Happy Crab... because this place really let us down.We had high hopes because I had heard good things... so when we arrived we discovered they had a buy three get one free offer. DING. Four of us. FOUR CRABS. Done.Chilli. Pepper. Fresh steamed. And Bee hoon soup. We had all four of their preparation styles. We also had their chili marinated top shell starter that was SUPER GENEROUS in terms of portion size, and a nice, spicy starter. Only I had to eat most of it because top shell wasn't too popular with the rest of the people at the table. A single portion shared amongst 6-8 people would be ideal though. It'd really whet your appetite.The crabs. Now the bee hoon soup was... average, the fresh steamed incredibly unmemorable, the chili a bit too sweet, but the pepper was quite delicious. Not quite Eng Seng at Joo Chiat level, but good. Why was it so disappointing though?a) Temperature: some of the crab pieces were actually a little cold. It seemed like all the crabs had been pre-cooked and then they're reheated and tossed in whichever sauce you order it in. b) Freshness: the crabs didn't come across as very fresh. The flesh had that slightly mushy, waterlogged texture that comes from freezing, and it was especially noticeable in the legs where the meat was really almost unpleasant. One of the crabs we had, I think the steamed one, also had a rather unpleasant smell of... ammonia. It tasted okay, still sweet, and a little mushy, but it smelled really unpleasant.Overall, the value was okay, but when I eat crabs, it's all about freshness.

Visited on a Saturday afternoon, the cafe was crowded. Thankfully there was an empty table that could sit 6 of us. They have a good selection of cakes available. We ordered the Earl Grey Cake, Lime pie and another cake which I can't quite recall the name. The earl grey cake color was super appealing, somewhat a shade of purple but not quite. It's really pretty. An unconventional taste that isn't too sweet. Would recommend this - not that it's super tasty but more so for its unique taste. The lime pie was really good! You could tell the love for this pie by the speed it disappeared from the plate. Just perhaps a tad too sweet for my taste bud, still a absolutely must have.can't recall the last cake we had, it's good too. Given its name, the cakes meets our expectation.

The Fabulous Baker Boy,the-fabulous-baker-boy-singapore,"I can tell I'm going to love this spot.First, it sits on some historical real estate - boss Juwanda says the building used to be the cafeteria of sorts for the old River Valley swimming pool (how fitting!), that has since been filled up and is now his front lawn. Better yet, his kitchen occupies the former men's changing room! Boss promises only fully clothed occupants now though.Yes, the shop's called The Fabulous Baker Boy, but he does so much more. There's a  healthy menu that is being re-jigged to include some pretty yum Big Boy Tacos, which he did make for me and the Girlfriend today as an early preview treat! Look out for the guacomole - it's got a little something extra in it that makes it even more yum.Also, look out for the prawn fettucine - I've heard rave/ravenous/raving oh never mind. I've heard great things about it, and it's set to be offered for both lunch and dinner services very soon.Then we come to the cakes. Why hello there, my pretty... okay enough with the creepy tapping fingers, but the scheming minds are very much needed here, because you'll need to plan wisely to maximise how much cake you can get in your belly. There are just SO MANY OPTIONS. Always ask for suggestions - that way I found out that the Nutty Monkey (banana cake in peanut butter frosting and coconut flakes in between) had just come back on to the list! On suggestion, we'd also picked up a slice of lemon and raspberry cake, which was a great choice to help cut through the ""jelat""-ness/heaviness of the Nutty Monkey.They've got a variety of bevs for you to sit tai-tai style and watch the world go by - coffee, a homemade iced tea, and beer and wine too, if you'd like.Also try: everything else.

The Fabulous Baker Boy,the-fabulous-baker-boy-singapore,"this is one of the rare finds in singapore. you are immediately greeted upon arrival at TFBB with a warm smile and a quick check of the reservations list (note: do reserve on weekends. they are obviously fab). I was seated in a comfy corner and menu and order list are all there. the menu... simple and easy to understand. well designed and obviously fab. i wanted to approach the counter to order but was immediately attended to promptly and my bff's crispy requirement to her pancakes addressed. i was escorted to the cake/pies/desserts from heaven section (maybe I have that i-need-dessert-now face). all the specials were introduced in detail and I felt at home. like how you will introduce your prized collection to your guest.our orders of extra crispy pancakes and croque monsieur was well done and served properly. granted they kinda forgot my extra cup of latte ordered but overall they were attentive to detail. me and my friend left the table to decide on the cakes we wanted and when we returned to the table, voila! our water was refilled and my friend's tea was topped up with more hot water! this was without us asking! i am impressed!While they have a policy on weekends that the turnover per table is 1.5 hours from reservation, we were not rushed out of TFBB. However, I can see why they need the tables. everyone wants a taste and feel of home on a saturday!the dessert was well done. i had the blueberry yoghurt cake while my friend had the raspberry cake. very well done and not too sweet. goes well with a cup of coffee. one gripe is that their latte art needs a bit more work (not consistent and a little sloppy).Overall, this is not just another restaurant checked off the list. a very impressive service staff that makes you keep coming back because you feel welcomed and at home. of course the dessert junkie in me is prepping for the next visit to try ALL their cakes.

The Fabulous Baker Boy,the-fabulous-baker-boy-singapore,"""If it aint broke, don't fix it. Don't reinvent the wheel."" Those were the thoughts that ran through my head as i sat through the preview of The Fabulous Baker Boy's new dinner menu. If only Juwanda were to stick to his brunch fare and cakes, I'm pretty sure people would love to have that for dinner as well.Let's start with my favorite part of the meal- the cakes. TFBB is known for their cakes and while there were hits and misses (Green Tea Praline was too dry, Red Velvet a tad sweet), the latest addition, the Pam D'OR stole the limelight. This cake was created in honor of Juwanda's muse, actress Pamela Oei, a dear friend of his. What's better than sticky date pudding? A sticky date cake sandwiched with layers of butterscotch and cream cheese. Oh brown sugar, latte butter cream, and Valrhona chocolate. This cake wouldn't always be available in store but i think it should be made a staple. A 3kg 9"" cake will set you back by $105 and each slice is $10. Love this one!Back to the dinner menu, skip the salads and starters as they are quite blah. The Almond Encrusted Salmon with a mango hollandaise ($22) had several decent elements, such as the fragrant fat-free mango hollandaise sauce that had just a hint of sweetness. The salmon was a little overcooked but still palatable and would certainly do well with more sauce. The contrasting textures could be enhanced with a creamier spinach rather than one that looked like it came through the cold pressed machine but the flavor of the veg was on point.I thought the Duck Confit ($21) was regular and by regular i do mean that it's not too bad. One of the more flavorful dishes of the night and the plus points were that it was fork tender and not too dry. I liked the cranberry plum compote that accompanied the duck.Steak Frites ($25) 230g NZ grass fed sirloin, grilled on the griddle, dressed with mushrooms and caramelised onions and the horrible fries. No comments on this one as it was forgettable. The fries were just horrid i can't even begin to describe them (gosh the oil).Serious room for improvement in the Fish Burger ($14.50). The components that i liked about this dish don't maketh a burger- the tangy Siracha tartar sauce, hint of curry leaves in the batter and the buttery billowing brioche. The batter needs to be WAAAY thinner and the fish needs more flavor on its own. Comes with the same horrible fries. The bastardized Fried Chicken &amp; Waffles ($21) which was served with a half chicken. The horrors!!! Always chicken fillet. ONLY chicken fillet. I didn't like this dish due to the super hard and dense waffle and the overdose of syrup on this one (it was already drenched when served). TFBB definitely needs to work this one out man. That said, the meat was sufficiently moist though the buttermilk flavor could be enhanced.Well well, that's my honest take on TFBB's dinner menu. Honestly i'm pretty certain customers would be happy with an all day brunch menu here with some heartier options. I do hope they work things the kinks out for dinner. In the meantime, be glad that you can now enjoy a slice (or two) with the extended opening hours at TFBB!",4WlVklOsSd409skDsWwQkQ

The Fabulous Baker Boy,the-fabulous-baker-boy-singapore,"gorgeous space, beautiful-looking food - but a complete disappointment in the tasting.the fabulous baker boy ain't so fabulous, really. it was disappointing in the most, but too mediocre to wreck/ rack my brains for any semblance of a rant.let's start with the good - the little compound it's housed in makes for a beautifully relaxing hangout: an open porch, the allure of a historic-type building standing lone in a patch of green overlooking the colorful buildings of clarke quay.but the dishes are pretty humdrum. my salad with pumpkin was a sparse mound of leaves topped with bland pumpkin (caramelization of any sort would have really helped here) and served with a vinaigrette that seemed right out a bottle (luckily I got it on the side); a shepherd's pie was full of potato and a barely-there layer of cheese, and you had to dig deep to get at the bit of gravied meat; while the eggs florentine came with a strange saute of minced spinach and garlic spread beneath (depriving you of any freshness that would come from the greens).the biggest let-down of the meal though, were the cakes. I expect a fairly high standard if you describe yourself as fabulous, and those expectations were certainly bumped out by the display of more than ten cakes. all tall, all colorful, and as easily orderable as they are pinterest-able.but the flavors? non-existing. the only thing you could taste was the dry sponge that seemed to make a showing in both our slices, a stale sort of crumbly butter cake. the icing was essentially colored-but-barely-flavored buttercreamwe took a mouthful each, and stopped after the first bite.so the meal is marked for me by our leftover slices of cake - which almost never happens. most slices of cake still turn out pretty much edible: it's just butter, sugar and sweet stuff, no? but these were so bad we couldn't ourselves to eat anymore - which is when we headed to the lovely drury lane for a brunch part two.I would steer clear. even their coffee choices are small and apparently tastes just as mediocre - so not even worth a suggestion for a sit-down for a cuppa. wholly disappointing - and I'm not sure I've had my brunch plans so thwarted in a long time.",znaofcTB6CKmdUqJSd17iA

The Fabulous Baker Boy,the-fabulous-baker-boy-singapore,"So I am a huge dessert fan and I really really wanted to love this place. I've posted this review in HungryGoSomewhere and didn't get a response from the owner. Now with Yelp in Singapore, I need to continue to share my experience.They have a great location - I had no clue where ""The Foothills"" even was? A friend told me that it was near Liang Court but across the street...where? The cafe is super cute. No boring mall location here. It's tucked away in a side of Fort Canning Park. Ample, comfortable seating. Cute decor - doesn't look Ikea to me. Oh and their cakes are super attractive looking. If you wanted a beautiful cake for a kids party, adult tea gig, heck, probably even a wedding, this is the place to come (notice that said pretty...which doesn't mean delicious or tasty). That's about where the compliments end.I had this cake a friend's birthday party and it was decorated like Cookie Monster. There was even a cookie hanging out of the side of Cookie Monster's face. Looked like a winner to me (remember, I said beautiful cake?). We cut it up and passed around sliced. The icing, I think, was a buttercream that tasted only of butter and maybe a teaspoon of sugar. The best way to describe it would be to imagine mixing a can of Crisco and four sticks of butter together. Now add two teaspoons of sugar. Drown in Smuft blue food coloring. That's the icing.On to the cake. The one we had was a salted caramel chocolate. Cake was tasteless and dry. I appreciated that it came in three layers with caramel in between, which that was nicely flavored. But the caramel wasn't enough to carry the weak, dry cake, along with lardy icing.Even after this bad experience that left everyone's teeth a bright blue, I wanted to give it another shot for a baby shower I was hosting. The cake's presentation was super attractive - I can't fault it for that. Really, it's an impressive looking cake.The following day, I went to the outlet on River Valley. I walked inside of the restaurant and there were three employees there: two friendly women and a shortish man who I can only assume is the ""fabulous baker"", owner, or boss during the shift. I asked if I could buy a cake and was told that I needed to order three days in advance. Cool, that's fine. But then I started asking questions about the cakes in the fridge and none of the three associates wanted to help me. What flavor are these? No response. How many flavors do you have? No response. I'm not sure why these associates froze up or acted awkwardly to my questions.I still wanted a cake. I asked if the cakes in the fridge were spoken for. Again, I got stares. Blinks. I pointedly asked the ladies and they told me to ask the shortish man. He said that they weren't but were to be served in the restaurant, as guests ordered them, sliced. Then I asked that, hypothetically, what if I wanted to buy the ten or twelve slices that would consist of a cake, could he serve them to me. He said that I needed to order cakes three days in advance. Broken record? I heard you the first time, shortish man. In the end, he caved and said that if someone were to come in and ask for ten slices, he would have to sell them to that person.So then I asked for ten or twelve slices of the cake in the fridge that weren't spoken for. The ladies stared at me again and kept blinking. I pressed the question again and they pointed to the shortish man. The shortish man just said he couldn't sell me the cake. I walked to the door and asked again if they were sure that they didn't want to sell me the slices and that I would tell my friends and blog about it; this was their last chance to remedy the bad experience I'd had. The shortish man said that no, he was not going to sell me the slices.All in all. Great looking cake that tasted sub-par. And horrible service. In Singapore, there are so many great bakeries now. PV Plain Vanilla serves a kick butt cupcake in Holland Village, OKB on Kampong Bahru has the best brownie I've probably had in my life, and then you even have Twelve Cupcakes that has recipes for the ""Asian palette"". Against these folks, it's going to be stiff competition for Fabulous Baker Boy.",wSw_5gRu3TFqzxk76Yc1NA

The Fabulous Baker Boy,the-fabulous-baker-boy-singapore,"Was there last night and where do I begin? 1. Fall in love almost immediately with the layout and quirky furnishing. It's a great place to mingle and events.2. The pie was awesome. Had a house pie and I must say I am so bringing people to have this the next time. Of course, while I try something else. but I guess it's the thing with fresh pies, it took a little longer than I expected to get it served on my table.3. The staff there was awesome. Didn't get to meet the baker boy himself but the coffee boy Haryanto did chat a lil with me. I love staff who will chat a lil and tell us a lil more. And guess what, they don't even charge us for that. (You will get the joke when you get there.)4. Although you might miss the place the 1st few times you pass by but you will never miss it again if you visited it once. It's actually right opposite Liang Court which means all you have to do is take the MRT to Clarke Quay and cross the road. Simple right? 5. If the place, the service, price and the food is right, why only 4/5? You didn't ask but I'm saying anyway. It's a shame that they only have 1 beer type and 1 cider at this place, when asked, Haryanto mentioned that they have issues with keep a big amount of stock there. tsk tsk. What a shame. Overall, I think everyone should at least visit the place once. Cause that is all it takes to get you there again. If you are a fan of ""The Pigeon Hole"" you will definitely like this place. Of course, ""TPH"" sells a lot more type of drinks.",Qo5N3TUZvEOnXam1La_ehA

There was just one other table at the time but we waited over 10 minutes for a cup of coffee and 45 minutes for the eggs Benedict! As the place filled up, one table got served their food immediately since they where friends with the owner while the rest of us had to wait.

The Fabulous Baker Boy,the-fabulous-baker-boy-singapore,"~Location wise~it can be a bit hard to get to if you didn't google it first. basically its at the foot of fort canning hill directly opposite liang court. (i.e. the opld river valley swimming complex) thanks to google i manage to figure it out~ambiance wise~ i would say its more like a tuck shop (i.e toa payoh swimming pool's tuckshop) there is a choice between indoors and outdoors. Even thou we choose indoors it was still rather humid/hot, and i was like sweating while i was indoors. Outdoor wise i would say even if they had fans they weren't as powerful to cool someone down. I was there around 2 - 4pm. ~Service wise~ its abit haphazard, in the sense that going there first they tell you to get a seat, then after they tell you to order at the counter. (most people would expect you to give them a menu if asked to take a seat?). Menu wise rather unprofessional, i mean having a menu printed out and pinned on a board shows the lack of professionalism. i would rather they have wrote it on a black board then printed on paper making it seems so not serious about their food.~Price wise~for the same price i think i rather go to TCC/coffee club or some restaurant  in liang court. It's probbly going to be a try once never go again (unless someone else is paying....) ~Table wise~ try to avoid the indoors the table is too narrow. My other qualms about the service, Water. basically each table was given water, but maybe cos they lack organisation or were really busy water came to us much later in the meal. (If i didn;t have my own bottle of water i probably would have choke, thou i must say its illogical that the water for 3 people came after the tea i ordered, what happened was a mix of chaos  and lack of a proper system) I witness some other table's order missing a sausage and stuff (food processing wise i would say they really lack organisation, i mean they asked if we wanted our cake with the food (again what kinda question is this??) and we opted to have it after the food, and they forgot about it, since they processed the first part and threw away the order chit, so when it came to our cakes we have to tell them and get the excuse that they forgot... *sighs*)~Food Wise~The only thing they had going for them was the food, i had egg Benedict, it was really tasty but proportion wise i would preferred if their cakes were a bit smaller. I would not recommend going for 2 course (I can really eat, but having both the egg Benedict and the carrot cake really made me skipped dinner)~Cake wise~ i had the chance to try 3 of them. their famous red velvet, their carrot cake and their lemon vanilla rasberry. i would say i found their carrot the best, some how the previous reviews had stated their red velvet was nice but i found both the red velvet and Lemon vanilla a tad too dry.  Overall i would say its a nice place to go in the evening for tea (after 5 perhaps?) but they fact that when they got busy it shows their lack of a system in place to deal with the orders and the amount of people reflects that there is a lack of organisation.this place needs a lot of improvements for it to succeed in the long run.",0NjHJNdJPdmc0WHV4VF7fA
Boon Tong Kee,boon-tong-kee-singapore-6,Went here for lunch and it was great. It started with the preserved duck egg which I would actually recommend (just don't ask for a full description until after you eat it!). For the entree we had chicken rice which was awesome. I definitely recommend this for a local meal. We also had the green dragon vegetables (delicious!) and a tofu soup that was awesome.

Boon Tong Kee is often regarded as one of local favorite spots where families and friends gather for good times over delicious Cantonese home-style food.

Although chicken is the signature dish here, there is a wide selection of irresistible creations you wouldn't want to miss out. Some of the notable mentions such as Fried Bean Sprouts with Salted Fish, Fried Assorted Vegetables (Kang Kong) with Sambal, Poached Chinese Spinach with Assorted Eggs and Crispy Deep Fried Chicken are quite popular.

Boon Tong Kee,boon-tong-kee-singapore-6,"Boon Tong Kee's chicken rice is classic. The other stuff they try to push on you is passable but just stick with the chicken rice and all will be well. Came here on the second day of CNY and the line was insane with over an hour wait. We had heard the claypot rice here was quite popular and thus we ordered ahead while waiting for our table so the timing synced up. Alas, the claypot rice is alright but very forgettable. But the dependable staples didn't disappoint. Love the fragrant savory rice here. I can eat bowls of it! Paired with the silken white skin and moist chicken, it just works. Another staple, that fried tofu. Impeccable delicate and soft on the inside with a light crispy exterior. I don't know how it holds its texture but when dipped in the salad dressing, so yummy! Oh and that char siew that's already on your table when you're seated... it's just sublime. Being CNY, we also ordered lo hei for some festive cheer and our server was really personable in preparing it. But for everyday classics that won't disappoint, the chicken rice, fried tofu, and char siew are winners for sure. Also this location is open late which is a plus for supper cravings.",DvcAC_nlKaTDsHcA8Slagw
Boon Tong Kee,boon-tong-kee-singapore-6,"When I think back to my childhood, hainanese chicken rice is one of its highlights.

The restaurant is clean and the staff have the usual stiff upper lip until you warm them up with some ""xie xie's"" and attempting to banter with them. We of course ordered a plate of HC which come with individual bowls of rice (hells yeh). The chicken never fails, especially when you top it off with ginger, sweet soy and chilli. We also ordered a range of dishes from fried tofu (hells yes), baby spinach with salted and century egg, a Cantonese fave, broccoli and mushrooms, ""gourmet"" fried spring rolls and the seafood horfun. Special shout outs to the tofu which was light with the perfect amount of salty coating and the horfun. Sweet baby J, the horfun was to die for. The sheets themselves were the fattest I've seen.

Decker Barbecue,decker-barbecue-singapore,"Let's start from the best part:  the food is actually really tasty! Five start easily just for that. We had spare ribs and brisket sandwich and both were amazing......but.  The service is horrible. Ok, I get the casual ambience, but why does everyone need to stand in line until their food is ready?  It's just a broken system (and a recipe for long lines... I wanted 20 mins for three people ahead of me, all with large orders). Just take the order and let people go!  And second, the prices are outrageous.  $93 for two people (with two beers ...two total, not two each!) You are seating outside, by the back exit of Boomerang, not a place that could justify that prices!Drop the prices, and improve the service!  Because I live next door, and really liked the food... :-)",Nv_gr_ujHLRQ8_y0MjfKnw

Jewel Coffee,jewel-coffee-singapore-8,"I hardly return to cafes in Singapore but I have been a huuuggee fan of Jewel Coffee since I join my gym. I'd like to say that our cafe scene in Singapore is good, but in all honesty it's only cafes like Jewel that make it good. Their coffee and the standard of their coffee is a benchmark. I've been to both their outlets and not only is the coffee good but the food at Rangoon Rd is pretty awesome as well. Forgive their small outlet in CBD, it's obviously catered for take & go but I'm guessing that it's the only way they can sustain the high rental in the area. When somebody ask me which is my favorite cafe in Singapore, Jewel is usually the first name that pops into my head.",dcKky5OVgR71kmSe1FNasw
Jewel Coffee,jewel-coffee-singapore-8,"This is one of two Jewel outlets in Singapore. The other one is on Rangoon Road and this smaller one is on Shenton Way in the CBD. Not surprisingly the guests and feel of the places differ a lot. This is more the go to place for a caffeine fix or a quick lunch for all the people slaving away in the CBD and unfortunately that also impacts the service here as it often feels rushed, not that friendly and occasionally the quality of the coffee is not at the level I am expecting here. That said the coffee is usually good and there is at least two beans to choose from and several different brew methods. I try to come after morning rush but before the lunch rush as the quality of the coffee is usually better when they have more time for it. The seating is limited indoors but there are some tables outside where it is fine to hang out for longer periods of time. The food is very much something that can be skipped. There are so many better options to get your stomach filled around here. Still it is a pretty safe bet for a cup of coffee when in the CBD although I would personally rather head to the New Black for filter coffee and 6 oz Espresso for espresso based beverages but this is also good.",sZ3mumX9WjJqp6qrjPPUBQ

Jewel Coffee,jewel-coffee-singapore-8,"I just stumbled across Jewel on my lunch break. I'm always on the lookout for a great cup of coffee, so even though I wasn't planning to get coffee, I obviously took my discovery as a sign from the universe that I should get a cup. Since Jewel is located directly across from Dimbulah, I turned to my fellow Yelpers for guidance on which joint to try & I'm so glad I went with the Jewel reviewers (Jewelers?).I got a basic mocha & it is phenomenal. I am drinking it as-is, no milk or sugar or whatever added, & it's delish - smooth, mellow, nutty, with slight citrus undertones. I could drink this for days!Another reviewer mentioned that Jewel's coffees are strong & can be bitter; I don't find mine bitter at all, but I should mention that I normally don't add sugar to flavored coffees as I find the syrup more than sweet enough. This is def the best coffee I've had in Singapore & my only regret is that I've lived across the street from Jewel for 4+ months & only discovered it today.",z4VBcggHg1vm_1Aw-7MZPw
Jewel Coffee,jewel-coffee-singapore-8,"A haven for coffee lovers in the CDB, Jewel coffee is doing some interesting things with single origin coffees, and with different brewing methods. Espresso - the volume was perfect, with a medium dark crema. The dominant flavour in the shot is citrus - but it's a shot where the astringency is very evident - as much a sensation as a flavour, an intense hit of citrus that awakens your taste buds, with an aftertaste that fades out slowly. The mouthfeel has some syrupy elements, but not overwhelmingly so either. The choice of single origin beans is a nice touch - when I visited, beans from Costa Rica and El Salvador were being served. Each has distinct tasting notes, however I found that the citrus elements were dominant in each. This is an intensely floral shot, and may not be to everyone's tastes. I'll never complain about single origin coffees on a menu - it's a sign of how far coffee culture has come, and it directly benefits the farmers who grow the beans in question. However, it could be a good idea to have one strong citrus single origin and one robust, earthy and less floral single origin paired with each other. The cappuccino that I ordered came with smooth foam that complemented, rather than drowned out, the underlying coffee flavour. The layer of microbubbles added the required smooth mouthfeel, while allowing the coffee flavour to dominate. The layer of foam and serving size were just as they should be, ensuring that this was separate and distinct from a latte. The latte art, and contrast of light on medium dark foam, was a welcome touch.There is a good selection of drinks on the menu, with Chemex, V60, Syphon and Iced coffees available also. It's a good coffee choice for anyone working in the Shenton Way area, however it is slightly more expensive, with an espresso priced at $4.20.",2aJZEdicQUqqOQG5-pwe-Q
Jewel Coffee,jewel-coffee-singapore-8,"I'm fortunate enough to have Jewel right around the corner from my office. I've been going to these guys on-and-off for over a year and while I'm not there on a daily basis I can attest to their coffee being of fairly reliable quality.Jewel offer only single origin coffee on their espresso machine. I think this is overkill as there's nothing wrong with a good blend but the origins they have on offer (they usually have two to choose from) are normally pretty good.Cafe owners passionate about coffee usually find it difficult to find service staff in SIngapore that can match them in knowledge and obsession, which usually affects the quality of the service. But the service quality at Jewel has definitely improved dramatically since I first started coming here which is very heartening to see.My only gripe about the place is that it's obviously set up more to cater to the take-away office crowd (of which I am also part) than the drink-in coffee drinker. This is evidenced by their lack of seating inside the shop itself (they have a sizeable al fresco area), their use of bar-stools and the self service set up. While I understand why a business owner would employ self service, I'm just not a fan. I don't like juggling two coffees while opening a door. It's a recipe for disaster if you're as clumsy as I am.Bottom line though, these guys serve some of the best coffee in Singapore and their sandwiches are pretty good also.

Jewel Coffee,jewel-coffee-singapore-8,"Gourmet coffee shops are becoming a trend around the island, especially in the financial and business districts - perhaps owing to the fact that people work hard in Singapore and caffeine is in demand.

It's a great place to have a quick meeting or to catch up with a friend. Unfortunately the indoor, air-conditioned area is small so you may have to sit outside when it is busy.

The Banana Leaf Apollo,the-banana-leaf-apollo-singapore,"Inspired by Andrew Zimmern 's ""Bizarre Foods"" episode where he visited Banana Lead Apollo (BLA) and had the so-called ""famous Fish Head Curry"" and raved about how flavorful it was, I found myself nearby at the Temple and opted to trek a few blocks further into Little India to this establishment to whet my appetite.  Although it is on 48 Serangoon Rd, the entrance is on an adjacent st. (on Hastings Rd) about a block from the Little India MRT station.  If you walked passed Campbell Lane, you've gone too far.  Yesterday, while I was there, it was intensely crowed because of a parade that appeared to be going along Serangoon as part of the Pongal Festival (a Harvest Festival).Oddly, upon entering BLA,  I noticed that it was only around 25% occupied, if that, on a crowded Friday night.  The interior is cold lit with what appears to be around 4-5 kitchens where there are staff preparing dishes at their respective stations and you'll often find them unsettlingly staring deeply at you while you're eating.Perusing the menu, I saw the Fish Head Curry selling for around $S22-28 depending on the size you wanted to order.  If you order this, I suggest you get the small to share with another person.  I ordered the medium and it was ridiculously too large.  In addition, we ordered the chicken Briyani (an Indian equivalent to chicken rice), some garlic naan, stewed curry vegetables.   With the dishes comes a complimentary serving of these circular chips that tastes like dried pig skins or shrimp chips.  I tried one and it was awe-ite.  The lingering housefly noticed I wasn't too keen on it and obnoxiously laid claim to it.Note that the green mat is actually a banana leaf that you can place your food on.  That is to say: the mat=plate. The chicken Briyani was pretty good and came with two sauces: 1) a curry based sauce; and 2) an interesting tangy yogurt with chopped cucumber (favorite sauce here)  While the rice was aromatic, the chicken lacked flavor and wasn't very appealing.  And now to the Main Event: the Fish Head Curry.  The server placed this huge bowl and a gigantic fish head in a red, curry based sauce.  This ""secret sauce"" pretty much tasted like any other curry based sauce in any dish in any Indian Restaurant.  While it made an excellent dipping sauce for the naan, would you pay $S26 for a naan dipping sauce?If anything, I was perplexed at how much meat there is in a fish head.  The fish head meat is soft (especially the cheek meat) and has a stewed consistency.  Honestly, it is more hype than anything.  Yes there is some quality, but it didn't ""wow"" me at all, especially given the price.The curry stewed vegetable dish was blegh.  Didn't do much to my palette and this is coming from a person who walked into this establishment very hungry.All in all the fish head curry is a dish where you're guaranteed to get your hands dirty as it's a messy dish.  That means unfortunately, you will have to wash your hands in the filthy bathroom located at the back.  Word of warning, do not use the washroom prior to eating.  If you do so, you will lose your appetite.The service is pretty reliable.  Though at times, they rush and do not listen carefully as the staff person gave us something we were only considering to order (a mango lassi which was actually not bad) but didn't commit to.All in all, the experience is a unique one, but I doubt that I'd ever need to stop by here again.  Thumbs up slightly on the quality and service.  Thumbs down on the atmosphere (especially the third world quality wash rooms).For these dishes and a Tiger beer, it will cost you around $S65.",pMltyeuU4SjT6Y8YVy7HBA

Some of it was even great.  It was all freshly prepared.  While nothing fancy, the  food was presented in a pleasing manner.Vegetable Samosa - Personally, I prefer the larger style samosas with more filling.  But these were good.  They were crispy on the outside and tender and flavourful on the inside.  They went well with the provided sauce.tinyurl.com/crp68poVegetable Pakora - These were  tasty.  But they were not as piping hot and crisp as I like them to be.  I did enjoy them though.tinyurl.com/cysvgkjButter Chicken - This was a sweet and buttery dish.  It was pretty much exactly what I expect from Butter Chicken.  They were generous with the chicken and it was very tender.No PhotoSpicy Prawn Masala - This was a very nice dish.  It was not very spicy though.  As with the chicken, the prawns were tender.  For my tastes, the prawns were perfectly prepared.tinyurl.com/cge9zxqAloo Gobi - This is not something you will hear from me very often.  My favourite dish was the Aloo Gobi.  Yep, the vegetarian dish won the evening. There was just so much flavour and it all worked so well together.  The cauliflower and potatoes were both cooked just right.  So good!tinyurl.com/bojsrtlRice and Garlic Naan - Both of these were well prepared.  I could have personally handled a bit more garlic on the naan.  But, all things considered, it was a good take on one of my favourite breads.Overall - This is a basic shop that serves better than basic Indian food.

The staples are always chicken masala, bryani rice, fish cutlets and sometimes fishhead curry depending how many people are eating. This time I also discovered chicken 65 - can't believe that I never had it all these time!",dBBQLSNK3xyowDow3wSQLg

The Banana Leaf Apollo,the-banana-leaf-apollo-singapore,Stopped here for lunch today Feb 3rd. Food was not bad but this place really feels like a tourist trap. They charge $3 for a wetnap left on the table for you to use. Also the menu shows a serving size of 3 prawns but they actually charge $15 or $5 per prawn. Also the $5 prawns were pre-cooked and warmed since they insides were tough and without any flavor or spices. Be carful out tab for 2 was $76 S. Street / stall Indian is much much better and tasty than this place.,0YtYmdcRr7GvXrGJCUk1gg
Druggists,druggists-singapore,"I'm not a typical beer drinker, if there is even a standard for that.  But when I stepped into Druggists, I just felt that the environment was so welcoming.  The friendly and helpful beertenders, the chic decor, the spaciousness, cleanliness and the idea that there are 23 taps of beer is just mind-blowing for me!  I had no idea which beer to choose because they are all craft beers - made from small breweries.  The idea is really attractive, I'm supporting small enterprises!  Still, it's challenging for me to choose a beer to start, given that my knowledge of beer is so limited.  If you are like me, fret not, the beertenders are able to recommend you a beer according to your preferences and they have been spot on for me!  Both Nad and Julianne recommended me beers that I haven't heard of and I like them all!Even though I set indoors, the acoustic in the dining area is conducive for conversations as the sounds from the customers kind of gets absorbed into the walls.The small bites are also very delicious!  I've tried the Prawn Paste fried chicken wings and french fries with chilli crab dip, all so yummy.  Although I would prefer more chilli crab dip in the first serving instead of having to order a second round of dip.Overall, it's been a very enjoyable hangout place for me and my friends and I will be coming back here whenever my beer-drinking friends want to meet up.",MmJ-gKRi3hRzBlVqEUEkOg
Druggists,druggists-singapore,"Druggists is a cool place with a tap list centered on European brew; in particular, sours and other unique stylesWhen I came here, they only had 3 IPAS on tap, which was very disappointing! Consequently, the beer list was not at all well rounded, only focused on two styles. Highly disappointing!Besides that, the atmosphere is great. Most beers are around  15-18, a bit more expensive then other beer bars in the city; however, sours also cost more. Would love to see more IPAS next time.",WfePuaS_iXGNGU6bfDe3JQ
Druggists,druggists-singapore,"Druggistnoun, North Americanplural noun: Druggists    a pharmacist or retailer of medicinal drugs.Origin:early 17th century: from French droguiste, from drogue 'drug'.the only medicinal drug that they sell here is beer!given that moderate beer drinking can have positive health effects on diabetes, forms of cancer, inflammation and even weight loss, i am more inclined to re-visit this druggist than the gym!;)i have been here 3 times and every time my beer has been cold!not as cold as the coldest pint of kilkenny from molly malone's irish pub in boat quay but categorically cold.the staff here have been nothing but friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.each time, they recommended something that suited my palate and/or disposition. on my last visit, i was introduced to De Molen Mooi & Meedogenloos, Beautiful and Ruthless!beautiful it was, dark and sweet and definitely ruthless in it's alcoholic content!i like this the best of the three i tried and it paired perfectly with a plate of pork roll that was plump full of distinctively flavoured minced pork with a tangy side salad and sweet, black dipping sauce.i could totally taste the freshness of the roll and the portion was indeed generous.yes, they do have a small but well thought out food menu for those who can't drink on an empty stomach!you can choose to sit alfresco out front, in the main air-conditioned hall, in the small, hidden lounge beyond the bar or way behind where the toilets are.if you like your beer and body cold, do stay in the main hall!clearly, this place is not for everyone.clearly, the price you pay for beer in SG is also not for everyone!clearly, i'll be back for my regular but moderate, over-the-counter prescription again!;-)",2jTqpqHAQnIzIfwHdaOiqQ
Druggists,druggists-singapore,"Ok, I think Singapore may not be totally ready for Druggists.  The fine folks at The Drinking Partners (thedrinkingpartners.com) decided to come up with The Great Beer Experiment and got some good buzz from beer enthusiasts that made the trek all the way out to Pasarbella at The Grandstand.    So, toes dipped and the water temperature promising, putting the whole foot in involved launching Druggist in Tyrwhitt Road, where the gestalt is decidedly more hipster, low rent enough not to go the whole hipster hog (just opposite Jalan Besar Stadium) and not totally slumming it at a hawker center.  The evening traffic, IS hipster, or so I've been told by the beertenders.  I've never hung around long enough to find out for myself, opting to scurry away before the sun climbs below the multi-story carpark at Jalan Besar Sports Complex across the street, like a Carpathian hay farmer fleeing the lengthening shadows.  So I'm really glad for the Drinking Partners that they had the stones to put Druggist out there, but that's just me, the beer nerd talking.  If it'll help, they have my undying loyalty and oh, here's a virtual string of garlic and a wooden stake from Crate and Barrel carved with calculated indifference...the only thing to put the hipster undead down for good, or maybe put Tactical Nuclear Penguin on the menu.Man shall not live by bread alone and beer businesses shall not live by beer nerds alone.  We may love and understand everything you do, but we also understand that you cannot pay the rent and all those enthusiastic young people on beer nerd custom alone.  You have to do the hard thing which, the almost impossible thing, which is to ""educate the customer"".  No scarier words have rung in the ears of those who dabble in the dark art of F&B.  My hat's off to Lincoln and the Drinking Partners!!So here are my recommendations for Druggist:Beer Nerds.  Show up early.  Preferably when they open.  Keep asking for the tasting flights which should have been launched by now.  Early is good since you have the place to yourself and you get to properly taste the wonderful rotating kegs (new kegs come in every Tuesday) in peace without being distracted by the bone chilling miasma of indifferent cool.   You get a bit more individual attention from whomever is tapping that day as well if you need to find out a little more about each tap.Ratebeer.  Whip out that smartphone, type Ratebeer into the search bar.  Get very useful rating information plus an invaluable guide to what to expect.   None of the Druggists offerings are below a 90 rating. Useful supplement to whatever the staff at Druggists are already telling you about what's behind each tap.  You get information on what other beer nerds from around the world are saying about this very beer that has your eye.Parking.  Multistory carpark across the street.  Basement parking also available at Jalan Besar Stadium, but a little creepy, but for me nothing compared to the threat of being mobbed by hipsters.  Street parking if you're early.Flights.  I wish they had them, but I just do my own when at Druggist.  So you don't rapidly reach a point of diminishing returns, you ask for about 100ml in each glass  taste it and then move on.  You end up paying for the full glass, but you don't waste good beer and you don't get wasted and you get to be a better person for having a more experienced palate for beer!  Still waaaaay less expensive than tasting single malts...Ok, to close, here's the sermon.  Beer in Singapore is close to where coffee is, a budding culture backed by people with a passion for their product, armed only with what little capital they have and a fierce belief that Singaporeans are ready to dig deeper and to understand the origins of beer, appreciate its traditions and explore the cutting edge of where global beer culture is headed.  I think we're getting there.  There is a nucleus of enthusiasts and a general open-mindedness about spending a little more to try something new, to explore outside the conventional, the commercial and the safe.  Maybe, just maybe that rich amber brew with the off tan head bearing that slightly funky fog of sweat sock going at $17 a glass might be a life changing experience, an epiphany.  The fine folk at Druggists are betting the farm that Singaporeans are willing to take that gamble and I for one am hoping fervently that my fellow Singaporeans are ready to roll the dice!",2arW6KJ-BAoAfNrYC7zaPA

The staff are very friendly and offer samples of different beers to help aid in your selection, however, I didn't really enjoy the appetizer I ordered. To my understanding, they rotate their taps and food items on the menu. I ordered the marinara cheese sticks. The bread was a bit soggy, but I did like their marinara sauce.

Druggists,druggists-singapore,"This place serves 23 craft beers (last I walked past) on tap from various nooks and crannies of the world. The place is tiny, has bad air-conditioning, and the size just makes sound reverberate in a really bad way.Came here on a Friday night and it was so loud we had to shout, and when you're paying $8 a glass for beer, it ought to be COLD. Within 5 minutes, my beer tasted like warm piss. I don't care where this beer was brewed, I don't care whether it is ale or pilsner or whatever, I do care about the temperature of my beer. Something needs to be done about the storage capabilities of this place. Mid-priced warm beer coming out of the wall in some location not really near an MRT? Errrr okay.I did take a look at their snacks menu - looks promising and very local, but I didn't try. Also, they don't allow you to taste test anything, with some clueless and overworked waitstaff at the cashier to collect your money and vaguely recommend you a brew. This place would be good if they allowed a shotglass tasting of all the beers they have on tap for an amount, say $20, maybe someone can suggest this to their owner.P.S.

Druggists,druggists-singapore,"If you like trying different craft beers from all over the world, you've come to the right place! They constantly introduce new beers, as long as one runs out, they'll replace it with something interesting. As a result, there are times when the menu is friendly to certain taste preferences, and others when you struggle to find something to drink.You can ask to taste anything before you order and their staff are very knowledgeable! I usually let them know what kind of beer I like and they'll recommend something that is close to the flavor profile you've described.The first time I came here, I had really awesome beer that was light, fruity and delicious. The second time I came, they only had rather tart beers - like one that tasted like pickles, another that was lemon, and one with sour cherries. It's luck of the draw, but if you like hanging out somewhere chill with your friends where you can actually talk, this place is perfect.",cCZpMsB_EXkMyn_OvQbdEA
Druggists,druggists-singapore,"Druggists has been my favorite beer place of late, and having a selection of 20+ beers on draft certainly doesn't hurt.  The list is primarily European, with a few American beer as well.  There is always a good selection of Mikkeller beers, and the other night, I also enjoyed one of my favorite beers of all times, Delirium.  They do go through kegs very quickly so don't get too attached to a particular brew.  All beers available by the half glass as well, which is great when trying types.  The food menu is also interesting with a global sliders list, some quite decent wings, as well as some nods to local fare. The place is small, but there is also seating outside if you are ok with the heat.   Definitely a great place for draft beer and no crap on tap here!",vRuHPM06W9iQJXK8XHbC3Q

Numerous parties after me all sat down at the same seats and were told of their policy and had to get up soon after. Would slapping a reserve sign on the table be so hard? On to coffee, we had a cappuccino and long black, the milk wasn't frothed well, and the long black was just the darkest point of my life to say the least.

Plain Vanilla Bakery,plain-vanilla-bakery-singapore-2,"After grabbing a bite over at Tiong Bahru, we wandered around the neighborhood a bit and ended up at Plain Vanilla Bakery. It was a nice place to stop and hop out of the rain for a little bit. The front is open-air with artificial turf that kids can (and do) run around on a little bit; there's also an ice cream cart that you can get indulge yourself at (with the help of a barista from inside the shop). Inside, the ordering area is lined with lots of different bites, especially cupcakes. The enclosed seating area is to the left of the outside area; we didn't actually make our way in there as we wanted to enjoy the (mild) relief that the rain brought. We didn't have to wait too long for our drinks, and they were both solid - mine was a very refreshing agave lemonade that I housed in about a minutes' time; my wife went with a fruity iced tea that was still quite unsweetened and was a much more subtle flavor. We did grab a brownie to share as well; while the texture was a tad chalkier than I like, I did like the faint hint of fruit (think it was blackberry, or something similar) that was baked into it.While it's a tad out of the way, Plain Vanilla is on a street that has a few other hipster-y shops as well, and it's a solid place to grab a brew (or another beverage) and relax/work.",CJmtS1Uk1KSsY2MWol_E7g

After deciding and paying, I brought my cake over to their sitting area which is calm, serene, and perfect for just relaxing and reading a book! The cake was moist, yet not too dense, and the chocolate flavor was not too overwhelming. The icing on the cake wasn't too sweet either.

Open kitchen for you to look at how all the sweet delights are prepared. They are shelves of kitchen items and cookbooks for sale too. No wifi, as I see this as a trend now a days... Either their are being cheap about it or maybe they use to greater-good excuse that people are suppose to socialise more rather than having their head bend down and stuck to their phones. Either way, they have a very limited sitting area - one large square table to share, one Long side seat with cushions and a Long table Infront. Ok if you are just there to get a cuppa coffee and read your papers or just enjoy a cup cake or pastry, for bigger groups of people, maybe not. They use wooden forks and styrofoam plates (not a big fan of their plates - very Unenvironmentally friendly...) and paper cups. Still , beautiful place to be at. I see people doing take away of their cupcakes in very large numbers. I would say that the cupcakes are pretty but fairly much on the normal side of things.

Step further in, you're brought to the food display! Loved the look of everything! Even the glimpse of cake pans and baking tools in their huge cupboard was instagram-worthy. Haha! Kudos to whoever the interior designer was.They sell, tarts, cakes, brownies and etc. Even cookie and cake mixes in jars. How wonderful! But what captivated us the most were the cupcakes on display. Me being the salted caramel lover ordered 2 of those, vanilla and hazelnut chocolate ones. Prices for the cupcakes were alright, standard. But the drinks! Blimey! $7 for a cup of lemonade? Eh?! And oh! You might as well know that they don't offer you any paper bag to stuff your cake boxes. They'll just tie them up with a string to act as a handle.

The shop itself is lined with daily specials, old favourites and row upon row of Plain Vanilla's famous cupcakes - to me, these are definitely the best cupcakes in Singapore!They have a great texture and deviate away from being outlandishly sweet; I love that every flavour says what it means and means what it says. Must-trys are the Earl Grey and Cinnamon! The cupcakes start from $3.50 each and I usually grab a box of 6; just like the Sound of Music, they're adorably tied up with string!

You don't need that much more when all you want is to eat a cupcake, right?The flavours are stellar as always, and I'm a big fan of the dark chocolate cupcake with Varlrona chocolate nibs, maybe because I think it's the manliest cupcake there - dark chocolate, and brown, muted colours - but then again, it's just so dang delicious. And those nibs add that crunch and a touch of that bittersweet raw chocolate finish... I think I'm saying too much.In fact, every one I've tried is tasty as heck, and with well-made classic flavour pairings like cinnamon brown sugar, strawberry white chocolate and milk chocolate banana, it's hard not to like everything you eat.This new store in Tiong Bahru is on the same street as the massively hip bookstore BooksActually, and also picturebook mecca Woods in the Books, not to mention earlybirds 40 Hands, you'll have your weekend needs covered just wandering down this stretch.",vDCCEp_bOJ6kcyxZOfkedQ

Old Chengdu Sichuan Cuisine,old-chengdu-sichuan-cuisine-singapore,"This is one of the two Szechuan cuisine places I will go to satisfy my craving for numbing spicy Szechuan food, the other being Si Wei Mao Cai.These two places serve pretty authentic Szechuan food and the portion is pretty generous, hence the higher price per serving.For this place, I usually get the chicken with chillis and a spicy bullfrog dish. Their chicken with chillis is very tasty, chicken fried just nice and the taste of the spices, garlic and chillis balance well to produce the flavorful and numbing chicken. They are very generous with their garlic, hence for garlic fans like me, this is a big plus.Their bullfrog on the other hand was not as fantastic as their chicken with chillis. We ordered the spicy and numbing bullfrog where the frog legs were literally drowned in the chilli oil, and the gravy within could not get into the frog legs, hence most of the time I just tasted oily spicy frog legs. No doubt the frog legs were fresh, but the gravy did not enhance the taste farther and it was rather disjointed. I would say it's an average dish.The previous time I was here, I ordered their spicy catfish dish which came in a huge portion. It could feed about 3-4 pax and the gravy was flavorful. What you should do is order dumplings or rice to go with this and you can enjoy the gravy at the same time.Overall, I would highly recommend this place, as I would usually take the trouble to write reviews for places that are worth writing for (against if it's really bad).",zkJ7aPyIzH61ei_nftYStA

Old Chengdu Sichuan Cuisine,old-chengdu-sichuan-cuisine-singapore,"Went here on Chinese New Year weekend. The food was not as great as I was hoping from the reviews. Ordered the eggs and tomato dish, dumplings, and beef fried rice. Could have just been an off night for them as perhaps they were busy during the day. The fried was okay, but prob won't be back.

Old Chengdu Sichuan Cuisine,old-chengdu-sichuan-cuisine-singapore,Great food. Spicy. We always go with someone who speaks mandarin as don't think much English is spoken.

Old Chengdu Sichuan Cuisine,old-chengdu-sichuan-cuisine-singapore,"Came here with a group of 30+ people. Rounds tables upstairs are ideal for large parties. We were able to fit 12-15 people each table very cozily. Thanks to the generous amount of chili and peppercorn used in each dish, it was one of the most spiciest experiences in my life! They say ""spicy in, spicy out."" Oh man, we'll find out soon enough..The undisputed favorite at our table was the Steamed Fish with yellow bean sprouts and chili (see my photo). Another favorite was the stir fried String Bean with chili. The plain and simple Eggs & Tomatoes were amazing, but mainly because it was the only non-spicy dish at our table! The location of this restaurant is convenient. It's right next to the Chinatown MRT. Exit the opposite side of People's Park and turn to your left. Bam. Time to spicy! Be prepared to have steam blow out from your ears.",_PqD0q8FSxMd2f_XleqECw
Old Chengdu Sichuan Cuisine,old-chengdu-sichuan-cuisine-singapore,Good place that opens till late night.. Very good portions and dishes are cheaper than some of the Zi char stalls and in good quantity. Mostly dominated by spicy items in the menu but there are some less spicy options as well that are very good.Nice place for something different and gives you a feel of being somewhat in China. Very authentic.,1tQfj737uhgdKcQ-5akTdA
Grain Traders,grain-traders-singapore,"Love, love, love this place.  I could probably eat it every day, for realz. Although I'd then be broke, but I'd be healthy, so what's more important? Anyway, my work people rave about GT all day every day, so I thought let me go see what all the fuss is about.  I ordered the upstream which was really really good.  The dressing was the real star, and although when you look at the amount of food you are getting, you start to panic, but you'll be full.  I promise.  You can also make your own salad, or bowl, or whatever, but they have some pretty good ones already put together.  The second one I tried had chicken, and more of a Mexican feel, but the upsteam was def. better.  For a meal, snack and water will run you $16.  Not cheap, but def. worth it.  I saw they also do breakfast, and have some interesting stuff going on, so looking forward to go when I have a free minute to spare in the AM.  Perfect for those who work in the CBD and need a quick, healthy lunch, or live in the area and need something after a work out, or on the way home from a late night at the office.",5mOW6BKTYPVa1OPyLStVFg
Grain Traders,grain-traders-singapore,"Delicious.. BUT EXPENSIVE! I really don't understand. Does eating lunch in CBD has to be this expensive? I know there are bankers and lawyers but there are also underpaid consultants (aka me) and also others who earn a decent salary for a living. I call this pure indulgent eating here, and can only do it once a while.  That being said, Grain Traders serves really good, fresh food. I enjoyed my food here tremendously. It definitely reminds of the fuss- free, health-conscious restaurants you get in Australia or the US. The concept is the same like The Daily Cut, you can either order set meal called ""Hero Bowls"" or DIY your own lunch. Same price at $16 nett. Hero Bowls section comes in 6 choices but since I was hangry (read: hungry + angry), i head straight to the DIY section. For the price you get to choose: 1 grain (quinoa, brown rice, japanese rice, or soba)1 protein (beef, salmon or chicken)1 hot vege (various items to choose from)2 cold vege (various salads, kimchis etc)1 topping (no, im not talking about rainbow sprinkles or m&ms here)1 sauce (you MUST MUST try the MISO CARAMEL sauce!!)........................and you get a bowl of wholesome meal. There;s also a coffee bar on the other side of the restaurant that serves decent coffee at the price you get from 'bucks. I got myself a cup of latte and it was pretty good, at $5.50. I spent a total of $21.50 of lunch today, which is equivalent to almost 3 plates of normal mixed rice from the hawker center. Will i come back, yes. Maybe once every fortnight. Or else I might have to get a bank loan to eat here daily. Lunch crowd (12-1pm) tends to get overwhelming so come really early or late to avoid the madness. Service is prompt and efficient overall! p/s: The miso caramel sauce is as good as the maple butter syrup from clinton st bakery. I can drink it on its own, I swear",K4ZeG8WAPfTS1AjD5GoJTw
Grain Traders,grain-traders-singapore,"One of my favorite breakfast/lunch places when I wanted something healthy in Singapore!For breakfast, I've had their polenta and oatmeal. They give you two 2-3"" circular pieces of grilled polenta with greens, beans, and avocado. For oatmeal, it's a big hearty scoop with delicious toppings. Oatmeal's a little bit on the sweeter side but what I loved about it was how sticky it was. Both are $8 SGD which is a little bit pricey but totally worth it. For lunch, I usually make my own bowl. I've had their tuna, salmon, and chicken as protein with toppings such as apple kimchi, beans, and roasted veggies. For dressing, their beetroot feta yogurt, wasabi, and coconut curry were my favorites. All the ingredients are super fresh. I also love their concept- it's healthy with unique flavors! The only thing I wished they offered was giving the option of doing half greens and grains for the base (you can only get salad only or noodles/rice only).Service is super quick (even during peak hours) as it is in the hustle and bustle area of CBD. Definitely recommend this place to anyone in Singapore who is looking for something healthy and hearty!",uBr83F_RITHSnnqqg83SGg
Grain Traders,grain-traders-singapore,"Let me make it clear, I am only taking off one star because of the price, as other people mentioned, of the bowls and drinks. As everyone says, the quality is there, but for lunch, it may be too pricey for an every day occasion. HOWEVER, I did want to review something that most people don't think of when they think of Grain Traders: THE BAGEL SANDWICHES. Only $10 and you get: a bagel, a protein, a spread, a veggie, and something extra. I always get their plain bagels toasted (they only have 2 types of bagels unfortunately), with jalapeno cream cheese, cured salmon, avocado, and spinach. ALL THAT FOR JUST $10! Great deal! The only sad part is that breakfast is only available 8am-10:30am. Booooo. I want bagels for dinner!",HX0W4gn5GkKX4qdhJzZMog
Grain Traders,grain-traders-singapore,"This will put a dent in your wallet, but once it touches your lips, it's just so good!I understand the appeal. In CBD, tons of people want healthier options, and this is definitely one of them. There are a lot of choices here, and possibilities seem endless.I'm usually the type who'd rather just choose whatever combos they offer, but none of them really appealed to me so I went the custom bowl route.You get to choose from lots of different grains, proteins, and veggie add-ons. Everything I chose tasted great: the charred corn, striploin steak, pickled capsicums, and the bean pico de gallo. Additionally you can choose a sauce, and that in itself took me a while because there was a lot and I wanted to try so many!Depending on what you get it could be $15-20. For Singapore, that's a pretty expensive lunch. To beat the crowd, you seriously have to go between 11-11:45, because once 12 comes around the queue spans the entire restaurant and there are no seats available.Enjoy your healthy lunch! I, on the other hand, just need to learn how to make all of these ingredients at home so I can assemble myself!",nzIq7_i0C79ToOp-U5e0fA
Grain Traders,grain-traders-singapore,"Simple, good food that's also healthy fast food! The menu hasn't changed since they first opened, which is a good sign - it's not an F&B outlet that follows the latest food trends.

Grain Traders,grain-traders-singapore,"What's with the attitude here, ladies? Grain Traders must have the shittest service in Singapore, hands down. Not a single smile and really curt replies when we ask questions. It wasn't even at peak lunch hour. And I thought it was just me, maybe I had too many questions since it was my first time, but my two other girlfriends had the same treatment. There wasn't anyone in line after me at 2pm. Ok, maybe they were tired from lunch service.The quinoa was yummy. The beef ok... For the same price I could get just as yummy a salad without the bitchiest attitude from the whole bunch of staff. Not cool, Grain Traders!",3c22LgxU9DkpT8oF74754g
Grain Traders,grain-traders-singapore,"Great food, crazy lunch crowd on a weekday (avoid if you wanna get seats) healthy eating never tasted so good. love the idea of the buffet line- the colors of the vegetables against great serving plates are clever. $16 for a bowl of hearty healthy portion. not cheap on the wallet but then again, we're in the CBD area. I will come back again",K-eMrHaAmeOfAA5yI8dF7w
Grain Traders,grain-traders-singapore,Food is good but very expensive starting at $16 per bowl. The food has a lot of flavor and tastes healthy. Long but fast line during lunch time.

Grain Traders,grain-traders-singapore,"Obsessed with this place! My husband took me for lunch today and I forgot to take pictures of the food, but I had the steak and salmon bowls to share. Coffee was alright but the juices were delicious. Definitely recommend, but seating is limited and it's super packed during lunch hours. Still, people don't eat for more than 15 mins on a busy work week so turnover is not slow. Steak is more filling and salmon is healthier. Husband said he also tried the pork which was good. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu. Will come during non peak hours since I'm in school anyway and don't have a set lunch time. Too bad they don't have one near my school (INSEAD) otherwise they would sell out so quick! Maybe do a pop up for a month or something. Anyway, right now daily cut and salad stop are the only healthy options. And class ends late so it would be nice if healthy options are open, not just bar food. Anyway, go and eat healthy here!",PK5NTAjdVY9mPdtwU0Ve3Q
Jai Thai,jai-thai-singapore-2,"Great affordable Thai food, one of my favorite solid places. While there're so many new Thai places that sprout up around the city, I love being able to head to a reliable place like this & know I'll have a tasty meal always! Especially as I love actual spicy Thai food with bite. The lunch sets are solid and come with drinks like lime juice. My favorites are tom yum soup noodles, beef noodles soup (very fragrant soup), pineapple rice set which comes with green curry and pandan chicken and a few other sides, green curry. The basil chicken is popular & it uses actual chili padi & packs a punch!This place also gives me the feels because it's a very popular RI/RJ haunt, and I've come countless times with different groups of friends. It's a very casual feel with no frills decor, but always clean. I also frequently visited the purvis street location last summer as it was close to my internship, and discovered other great dishes like mango sticky rice, papaya salad, omelette, pandan chicken and so on. Never disappoints!",YwxjrOYe1X5bJxWtmiENQQ

Jai Thai,jai-thai-singapore-2,"Nicely located within my parents neighborhood, I've seen this Thai eatery grow from here since its humble beginnings to a brand name with other outlets across the island. They have maintained the same menu and budget prices that have helped then build a loyal following. Almost everything on their menu is value for money. Whether you're eating solo or treating your family, you feel you've got your money's worth. That's why the only accept cash. I've eaten their awesome beef noodles since they opened shop and it tastes the same today as it did the day they opened. Same robust recipe that build them a reputation. And it still costs $5. For the robust flavor and chunks of beef brisket you get, this is good food at a great price.Come early or call to make a reservation. Otherwise you'll have to wait, especially on weekends. Take note of their opening hours because they only open for lunch and then they close until opening for dinner again. They take those rest hours for rest and prep time before their dinner crowd.

Jai Thai,jai-thai-singapore-2,"Have been a regular fan here! I visit this place mostly on Sundays. The restaurant is tucked in a really quiet neighborhood but I drive, so its easy for me :D Parking isn't too hard to find given if the residents are giving people. There's always a crowd for sunday evenings, even for an area like clover way.The food is great, all of it. And the price is too! Only thing that i found expensive were the drinks. Thai milk tea at $2.50, not so cheap.  The restaurant floor is run by just 2 guys whom will seat you down, take orders and serve them. Just 2 only but no complains, service is decent and efficient if i might say. Only accepts cash payment only. So always check your wallet before ordering away on those irresistible yummies!",_OHM_7WPZrI-cL7Q11g6yg
Jai Thai,jai-thai-singapore-2,"We finally found the time to search for Jai Thai since moving into the neighborhood recently. On Google maps it looks like there should be a short cut rather than having to get to Junction 8 first and ""hiking"" into the little enclave of Clover Way. Anyway, enough of the Bear Grylls stuff, Jai Thai is situated in a nondescript row of modern shophouses book ended by two coffee shops. It's nothing fancy inside, brightly lit with cheaper furniture, but this place isn't about the decor, it's about the food. You shutdown with a menu, pencil and paper and order from the large two sided menu. When ordering from a Thai restaurant for the first time, my theory is that you have to order Tom Yum seafood soup and Green Curry Chicken in order to do a true comparison. This we did accompanied by beansprouts stir fried with salted fish and chicken with holy basil. For drinks we ordered a Thai Chendol  and a Thai iced tea. Service was swift and we settled in for a great meal. The Tom Yum did not have the coloring you see in many restaurants, but was very spicy. The seafood consisted of Octopus, fried fish and prawns, and the ratio of seafood to soup was very generous. Did I mention it was spicy?  The green curry was delicious.  Thick, creamy with a flavor of coconut and very spicy also. Generous chunks of chicken with this vegetables I never remember the name of, but you only see in a Thai green curry. The bean sprouts were crunchy and flavorful, and while unable to vouch for the holiness of the basil, the chicken with holy basil was a delightfully spicy dish. For sure, all dishes were spicy, but hey, it's a Thai restaurant right?  It was also easy to avoid the devilish little chili padi if you wanted to. The drinks were enough to cool down any mouths on fire. Prices were very reasonable and we will certainly be returning. Now if only we could find that short cut.",i2G5mQrL1g_wgSuL8DGExQ
Jai Thai,jai-thai-singapore-2,"I'm from Thailand and Jai Thai is one of the three regular places I visit regularly. That should say a bit about the food there :)Because it's not as easily accessible (although near enough to walk from Marymount), the queues here are not crazily long as Nakorn's. That said, don't expect it to be empty. I have been there all sorts of time and never once see it empty.The food is affordable and helps me miss home a bit less. I'm tempted to say that everything is nice here, but that won't be too helpful. My usual orders here include: fried fish dish with thai sauce, chicken and basil leaves, and Thai iced tea.",DvFz8y_bUxQrhUWQZDFdKw

Jai Thai,jai-thai-singapore-2,"Amazing prices for great Thai food. The food is affordable enough for me to spot a few tables of students from a nearby school.I was here for a late lunch and thankfully it wasn't crowded at all. The set lunches are great value, you get a drink (lime juice/etc) and a dessert (tapioca! yeah!)  in addition to your main course. The thai beef noodles were really good if you are in the mood for something light and soupy. The broth is sweet and flavorful and not too oily. And the noodles is actually the thin rice noodles, the kind they use in pad thai. Very good.The pad thai is sweet, as in most pad thai. Not the best I've had but definitely better than average. The shrimps that comes with it were large and succulent and very fresh.Pandan chicken is a great side dish. Only $2 per piece, and it is not chicken breast! woohoo!Great little find in a otherwise-filled-with-factory-canteen neighborhood.  Plus free parking if you can find a spot around the area.",4y4obgWxi_CL25nRHrhuEA
Jai Thai,jai-thai-singapore-2,"The food was ok, not worth the very very far walk into the ulu location. The paht Thai and fried tang hoon is too sweet and sour for my liking. Nothing special about the tom yam soup. The only plus point is there is no queue and the food is served swiftly. Personally, I rather queue in nakorn rather then eating here. Don't waste your time if you don't have a car.",Uhtfu1zBo4_RpoBR3gSe2g
Jai Thai,jai-thai-singapore-2,"I'm trying to think of reasons why I shouldn't give Jai Thai 5 stars... and there are only three I can think of: First, that they don't serve alcohol. How great would a beer be with that spicy green mango salad? Oh, and second: if Jai Thai delivered, I would positively be in HEAVEN. Thirdly: Jai Thai is cash only. Booooo for those nights I haven't had time to stop at the ATM on the way home from work. So, really, Jai Thai is nearrrrrly at 5 stars for me, but what they do have is crazy good. It's true what's been said before -- the value for money here is second to none. The sign outside their door is correct: Wallet Friendly Authentic Thai Cuisine. I've spent a lot of time in Thailand -- this is the real deal, yo. They have plenty of dishes for diets of all kinds, including vegetarians, and so far everything I've tried has been teh awsum. My current favorites are the broccoli with prawn, the aforementioned green mango salad, any/all of the squid dishes, and HELLZ YAH TO THE FISH CAKES. The prawn cakes are good too, but the fish cakes are wayyyyyyy mo bettah. You will be so missing out if you don't order these, trust me trust me trust me. They have several set menus which are also great value, particularly for lunch or for larger parties. Thai iced tea is sweet and plentiful, and service is swift and friendly. What's not to love? Erhm, maybe the industrial fluorescent lighting is a bit... difficult. They don't get points for atmosphere. But you'll be so involved in what you're eating that I doubt it'll stop you from returning...",-moHpbkKEoClAzfgeDIzbA
Jai Thai,jai-thai-singapore-2,"I had heard that this is a very value for money place to visit for good Thai food, and decided to make a visit together with my friends.Unfortunately, we forgot to make a reservation ahead of time, and had to wait for quite a while in a queue before we were able to get in.Once we got in, we also had quite a long wait for the food, but I guess that can't be helped given the popularity of this place.But anyway, let's talk about the food.We had the deep fried seabass with pepper & garlic, which was really fresh and very well cooked with the crispy skin and succulent flesh. Given the relatively cheap price of this, we were very impressed with the quality.Another notable dish that we had was the tom yum soup with prawns, which was also fantastic. The tom yum soup was not excessively spicy, and the seafood found within was really fresh.Overall, this is definitely a must-visit place if you're on the prowl for affordable and delicious Thai food.",Wnjh_5SaxBDNZ0YUux8m1w

The set also comes with a drink and a dessert (albeit in tiny portions), all for less than eight dollars. I sometimes order the Beef Noodle which is pretty decent too.

Jai Thai,jai-thai-singapore-2,"For delicious Thai food that is good and affordable, look no further than the Clover district. I lived in the area for 2 years, but it was not till my friend told me about it that I actually walked over. They have a green curry set and beef noodle set for less than 7 dollars, and it comes with a drink as well as a dessert (usually konniyaku jelly). The olive rice sets/rice sets come with portions of chicken/green curry and more - so if you intend to try their specialties, go for it as you can try a bit of everything in bite sized protions - the best thing is that is less than 10 dollars. Do also try the Thai iced tea that comes with crushed ice and the milk tea is not too sweet - it is slightly more orange than normal iced teas though and it's an interesting blend. The ruby chendol - is also really delicious and the red bits are slightly crunch + juicy - it is a great mixed with the coconut milk.",5EWSLyXrh4WWpAL1ghrgng

Feel so warm! Not many resto in singapore doing it! Okay lets star reviewing the food, we were like 20 people and we order one giant pizza like 21inch bacon miele (pork) sgd55 taste really good! Love it We also order prosciutto crudo di parma (pork) - combination of parma ham and rocket salad, love the combination, the salad give a vegie taste to neutralize the pork taste (im not really a fan of pork though) Pizza margherita - not that special like the taste of margherita We also order chicken wings and calamari - they are ok but not outstanding.Overall the highest rating given with combination of everything place and staffs are warm enough and the food love it so much!

Peperoni Pizzeria,peperoni-pizzeria-singapore-4,"The food was not too bad, but I had a really bad experience with the stubborn and rude staff. A friend booked a table for 6 at 6pm. The plan was to have some pizza, a couple of beer and then catch a movie like a proper boys night out. Little did we know that we were chased away by 730pm. We were not told we had to scarf down our food and beer with 6ppl in 1.5hrs! They insisted that they told us even though they obviously didn't. They even took our order of a glass of red wine and a pint of beer and expected us to be done in 5mins.The most outrageous part was when they decided to waive the beer and glass of wine and rather take back the beer that had already been consumed, DIRECTLY from my friends hand and throw it out rather then let him finish it since they waved it so they can chase us off their premises.This was one of the most shocking displays of service I have ever encountered with a bill close to $200.Oh well..

I would say that I prefer it more flavourful (more salt pls) but hubby tried and said it's me. :PGaint Pizzas - we had 2 giants so that 4 flavours altogether. The pizzas were very well received by everyone.  Kids like the square shape pizzas they cut them into and happily dug in with their hands. We were a part of 5 adults and 4 kids, and still had to doggie-bag quite a bit of pizzas. Oh well, hubby was happy to be able to have more pizzas for the subsequent days.

Peperoni Pizzeria,peperoni-pizzeria-singapore-4,"We were really glad when Peperoni Pizzeria opened up a branch in our neck of the woods as Greenwood Ave and Binjai, their earlier outlets were a bit out of the way for us. However, it seemed we weren't the only glad ones as it's always packed to the brim when we swing by, so we could only get the XXL pizzas to go. This time, we decided to make a reservation and have a proper dinner there.We got the calamari and pancetta pizza to start while waiting for one of our friends to arrive ... the calamari was pretty decent and went well with the mayo and salsa dip provided. The pancetta pizza was pretty good except we would have preferred the egg to be runny like the one from Spizza. Love the peach and banana smoothies! We then proceeded to get the pepperoni pizza and the Amatriciana (linguini with smoky bacon & sautéed onions in zesty tomato sauce) when our friend arrived, before ending off with a tiramisu to share.Everything was pretty good for a casual pizza joint and service was pretty efficient.

Peperoni Pizzeria,peperoni-pizzeria-singapore-4,"I LIKE this place.Peperoni is comfortable, unpretentious and welcoming.  Its location in the old walkup apartments across Great World City is convenient whilst retaining a more charming and private vibe than the shopping centre eateries.Naturally, Peperoni is best known for their pizzas, which are very good.  Thin crust with the right amount of bite, and generous toppings.  They've got the classic types of pizza covered, as well as some more unusual varieties.  The XXL pizza is always visually impressive and a fun challenge for larger groups.Though I might actually like the pastas better...  Like the pizzas, they're cooked precisely, done al dente.  Sauces are flavourful and portions generous.  Fantastic comfort food.Prices pretty reasonable too (20ish for pasta. sub-30 for meat-based mains) particularly when you consider that it's part of the Les Amis group.Definitely recommended.",qvVaHr04qHp-iooOBzJk3A

Genki Sushi,genki-sushi-singapore,"There are only 3 things here that keep me coming back here (besides the fact that my friends love this joint).1. The DBS Card deals that they keep having, waiving a good 10% off the bill if you have a DBS/POSB Debit/Credit card. 2. The cute kiddy trains that deliver your sushi, and the iPad you use to order your sushi. (Novelty factor aside...)3. The one or two avant-garde sushi orders (that I don't really see in other joints), like the tempura egg that has a runny yolk, and the green tea powder they put out (where you can make your own green tea with the hot water dispenser)... pretty fun I must say!",tBoiIg3s8gUtYNeFrYHBLw

Genki Sushi,genki-sushi-singapore,"Genki sushi is well known back in the states. The concept is different in the U.S. than it is here in Singapore. In America, all Genki sushi's are conveyor belt style. Here in Singers, it's a totally different concept, and one that I greatly admire. Once you are seated, you are handed an IPAD where you place your order. Once you place your order, you sit back and enjoy your company, and in due time, a race car comes out on a belt and delivers your sushi orders. If you are there with kids, they'll get a kick out of ordering off an ipad and watching the race car drive by their table with food in hand. The food is fine for what it is, and we weren't expecting the best quality as this is more of a budget sushi spot. The fish tasted fresh still, and you can stuff yourself until your heart's content without breaking the bank.",sg7ckPotdcAeIKf0n3GApg
Genki Sushi,genki-sushi-singapore,"I have been trying out various sushi restaurants in Singapore and found out this one is really among the best quality in terms of the rice rolling, fish freshness, and cutting effort! What is little bit disappointing is the rice was  presented too loose and waiters don't really take away any finished plates during the eating. But overall it is definitely most worth recommending and trying compared with most other chain sushi restaurants in shopping malls!",sYQeGhjfLC8KkviwUFBXKQ

Asanoya,asanoya-singapore,"What a beautiful and modern Japanese bakery. Their decor is mainly white with clean lines. The buttery scent of fresh baked goods greets you when entering in. There's lots of seating and greenery plants placed on some tables. This bakery offers baked bread, pastries, ice cream, tea, and coffee. I've come here several times, and enjoyed some of their pastries. My favorites were their salted caramel banana almond croissant and the coffee danish. You can taste all the flavors described and the butter. The coffee danish had a lovely flaky texture as well. I only had a chance to drink their earl grey tea, but it was strong and flavorful. If you're ever in Singapore, this is a bakery to check out. Especially if you're close to this bakery from your hotel.",GYwyxg6vZNH6S8hV2TIeRQ

Asanoya,asanoya-singapore,"Woke up this morning, saw on Instagram that a friend was here having yummilicious salted egg croissants and BAM, 3 hours later I'm chilling in a white muji-like chair enjoying my tray of treats at Asanoya.Verdict:- Matcha Salted Egg Croissant: This is simply divine. I'm not a fan of salted egg confectionery so I was kind of hoping that the matcha taste would overpower the salted egg and I was right! If you've ever eaten ""boulou bun"", the chinese version of salted egg buns, the Matcha Salted Egg filling is similar in texture to that while the croissant was light and fluffy - just the way I like it! I ordered this as a takeaway but after a while, I decided to have it right there and then. I was too lazy to ask the staff to heat it up for me but I bet that it will taste even better if it's warmed up. Will remember to do that next time.- Bacon Pizza (Popular choice): I picked this because it was deemed as the popular choice and I wanted some meat. However, in my opinion, nothing really special about this except for the 4 tiny cheese cubes on the Bacon Pizza. The cheese cubes could be bigger though but otherwise, I would choose other pastries to try next time.- Chicken Miso salad: It looked better in pictures then it actually is. Priced at $3, it's a good stomach filler if you're not so hungry and yet want something savoury besides bread to go with your coffee or juice.- Cold pressed carrot juice: $5.80 for freshly cold-pressed juice? A tad pricey in my book but I was in the mood to indulge. They only have 4 types of fruits to choose from - apples, orange, carrot and watermelon.I am really not a bread person but today, I had bread for lunch (enough to last me a month) and I feel quite satisfied. Says a lot about Asanoya right? Spotted lots of Japanese ladies and men having lunches and tea breaks there and it sure added to the whole jap muji-like feel of the place and that is why this place has 5 stars from me (plus the clean washrooms and plugs too)! All of their breads are gorgeous in presentation and it was difficult to decide which to try. Will be sure to return within the next few days as it is right next to SMU!Also, Asanoya is currently giving away 10% voucher for your next purchase with a minimum spend of $10.Tip: The places gets a little bit crowded during the lunch hour but it is still bearable. Best to avoid lunch times between 1-2pm. The seating area is peppered with lots of power points so it's a good place to chill and surf net/charge phone/play games or write reviews! Plus, the toilets are really clean and nice so plus points there.",ZNyfGsIwsedPlpjmoaq3Eg
Asanoya,asanoya-singapore,"A Japanese bakery located just off Bras Basah Road is a gem find especially when attending art/museum events in the evenings.  A wide spread of bread is available from caramel apple cube to curry donut.  I had the cafe's house special, tea bread, which is flavoured with earl grey tea leaves and condensed milk. I can't wait to revisit and try the other breads. There is also a gourmet shop that sells jams, spreads and dips.",HZNNx5s6cIY7s0XOrstWIg
Asanoya,asanoya-singapore,"Something that bewildered me is the sheer popularity of the Cube Loaf--cream filled cube-shaped bread available in Yuzu cheese, Caramel apple, Matcha, Chocolate, etc. Perhaps due to our nation's fetish for something goeey or flowy in the centre (think Liu sha bao or molten lava cake), this has been the most featured item on any media platform. However, I suggest we try to manage our expectations as the Matcha is just a chewy chocolate bread filled with sweet matcha custard that is resistant to flow. Perhaps the chef did not intend to make it flow in the first place. The problem wasn't whether it flowed or not, but that the cream was too sugary, to the extent that it overpowered the demure tea taste. At a hefty tag of $4.50, I'm hesitant to invest in another one. The Cinnamon Danish ($3.20) called out to me with that attractive dark brown sheen but it was more chewy than crunchy, as the sticky caramel goo clung on stubbornly to the knife .....and my cavities the more I chow on it. Though the Sweet Potato Yuzu Cream Danish is constructed on the similar danish base, the main ingredients helped to distract us away from the mediocrity. Yuzu is not only visibly detected as peels on top but also in the white cream base, which imparted a lovely tanginess that complemented the warm sweet potatoes. I was glad we stood by this ""less-popular"" option instead of the all-too-common blueberry custard danish. The other autumn-inspired bread named ""Harvest"" ($4.50) was also excellent. The texture of the bread is chewier than an average European baguette but the subtle honey flavour crawled out as one slowly bite into it. The earthy sweetness from the candied sweet potatoes, chestnuts rode upon the savoury cream cheese to create another wonderful dimension in this humble stick that is easily overlooked on the shelf. I love the Signature Curry Bun, which tasted like any orthodox non-spicy Japanese curry bun with the mellow sweetness. We were lucky to get one from the batch that was hot out from the deep fryer so it was crunchy and not too oily. The Mushroom Quiche ($6) is indeed a very straightforward quiche with plenty of mushrooms. While there could be more salt in this, there was enough that it registered for me. This was good but the Potato French was even better. At $3.20, one get an entire potato with skin intact, snugged tightly within the crusty French bread under the luscious blanket of butter and mayonnaise. Have it warmed up and one would be greeted by mini billows of steam from the soft potato. Genius.Despite the liberal amount of icing, I was not assaulted by a blast of sweetness in the Caramel Apple Croissant ($3.90). The tartness of the soft-but-not-mushy apples cut through the dense almond paste. Also, the flaky pastry here managed to salvage my impression of their weak Danish dough. The signature Karuizawa Green Tea Loaf is sold here in grams at $2.60/100g, which is about the weight of one slice. Blended with white chocolate, the bread has a tinge of milky sweetness, which was slightly different from the taste when I had it in Japan. Nonetheless, the texture is still spot-on; soft stretchy with a crusty brown shield. Would be great if they can also introduce the Coffee loaf in future.Overall, the savory items were more remarkable than the sweet items, even though the price across all items was not very pocket-friendly. I was quite disappointed by the sweet bread but maybe to think on a positive note, the cube loafs are something exclusive to Singapore market. Nonetheless, there is still room for improvement before both the quality of the food and the service standards here can match up truly with the level in Japan.",dJzKwp5k65MK3R_qn4Xpow

Asanoya,asanoya-singapore,"It's been a couple of months since Japanese bakery chain Asanoya Boulangerie opened its first-ever outlet outside of Japan in Singapore but i wasn't too quick to join the queue at the Queen Street outlet. Well i guess that's a good thing since when i recently visited, i found the place quiet and peaceful (also empty) during brunch time on a Saturday. Well i guess the hype kind of died down when people realised that Asanoya is first and foremost a bakery, not a cafe. Hence, unless your idea of brunch is a small sandwich, pastry or cake, you may be disappointed when you visit. Thankfully, Asanoya's offerings are perfect for this petite bread lover! Also, do not come expecting artisan coffee. My flat white was nothing like a flat white and it was burnt, but i was wise not to have any expectations.Before i could get started on my order, i was distracted by the freshly baked loaves on display. Of course i had to sample them before i can decide on what to buy home!The signature Karuizawa bread comes in various flavors and i tried the blueberry and green tea ones. The bread has the typical European crust (though not too hard) and the interior of the typical soft chewy and airy Japanese bread. Each loaf is pretty big, weighing more than 1.2kg but they price it by slice/weight as well, so you can easily grab a few pieces in your preferred flavors. The breads are lightly sweetened and perfect on their own.Asanoya also has the smaller earl grey tea loaves ($4.20) which everyone should get their hands on (i would walk away with all in fact). First flush earl grey tea leaves are used and flavors such as orange and blueberry are also available. I would have gotten the original but the blueberry was a nice match with the tea (orange was a little overpowering).On to the savories, the Bacon quiche ($6) had an asian flavor to it (onions) and tasted a little like those zi char fu yong omelette. The egg custard was still satisfying, that it until you hit the extremely salty cheese bits. The crust needs more work as you can see from the thick, undercooked and hard edges.Other hot savory favorites include the Potato French bread which encased an entire potato in it, with butter and mayonnaise. Comes highly recommended by fellow food bloggers. Carb in carbs anyone? The Campagne cranberry and cheese bread would be my choice for brunch if i could stomach more food. Just look at those chunks of cheese! Other than that, i also would not give the maple walnut pretzel a miss.  As for the sweet stuff, Asanoya is known for their lava Cube Loaf ($4.50) which comes in chocolate and green tea. Do not expect it to ooze like a lava cake. I was under the impression that the wait staff would warm it up for me (he said he would) but the center was still cold. Well, the custard was sufficiently milky, with a light sweetness. I did enjoy the slighty chewy bread and i could it on its own. Overall, Asanoya Boulangerie is a nice spot to enjoy some tea bread with tea (skip the coffee please). I would consider popping back to stock up my breads if i'm in the area. You can also get spreads, dips and oils which will complement the breads from the on site gourmet shop. Set lunches are available too.",4WlVklOsSd409skDsWwQkQ

Nara Thai,nara-thai-singapore,This Thai restaurant is located in the Ion Orchard mall and was recommended by a fellow Thai coworker to go there. I came here with a party of four.We ordered a variety of dishes and I thought everything was rather tasty. I've never had Thai food outside of the United States so this was a first! Everything is a lot spicier here and there are certain dishes that are missing from the menu (where is my pad see ew). We got the papaya salad and it was incredibly spicy but rather tasty. I like strong savory flavors and thought this one was great. The heat from the salad was a killer though and I'm pretty sure I started sweating at one point.The tom yum soup was also delicious and quite spicy. I love rich flavorful soups and this was good.We also got the dessert that looked like flour or rice balls in a coconut sweet broth (like Chinese tong yuan). They tasted really good and not super sweet. I like Mochi like items so this was a good fit for me.Service was kind of hit or miss despite nobody being in the restaurant though.If I'm in Singapore again I'd love to try this place again.,taPq7IxYskEWH7Vfc261pQ

Nara Thai,nara-thai-singapore,"It seems like I keep ordering the same thing whenever I dine at Nara Thai. The lunch sets are affordable with prices starting from $13.90++. There are only 3 options for now and I have only tried the basil chicken with fried egg and rice set. It comes with prawn tom yam soup and a choice of drink. I usually have the Thai iced milk tea which is really good.The portions could be smaller than a la carte but I find it sufficient and filling. The basil chicken with fried egg is flavorful and spicy. The spice level is medium and you could ask for more or less spicy when placing your order. I finally found a use for the cucumber which does help to tone down the fiery heat on the tongue. The tom yam soup is creamy and also spicy with the tangy sweetness of the tamarind. They are generous with providing 3 prawns and some straw mushrooms in the soup. None of those watered down soup here. The Thai iced milk tea finished off the meal with a sweet aftertaste. Coffee and lemongrass are also part of the choice if I remember correctly. The other two options are:1. boat noodle (choice or pork or beef), pandan chicken, mango salad (I think, either that or papaya salad) and drink. 2. curry pork and some side dish and the drink. I cannot recall what is in the  set now.Lunch set is only available on Monday to Friday, excluding public holidays etc.",Q1oMmm7tKPOzA7_gqcV4zg
Nara Thai,nara-thai-singapore,"Food wise, this place wasn't too bad. I particularly enjoyed the beef noodles (though the noodle isn't the fat chunky ones they have in Thailand, but it'll have to do). You may want to try their soft shell crab with blue butterfly pea rice as well!When it comes to affordability, I would say that there are definitely cheaper options out there. I paid $6.50 for an average tasting lemon grass drink, which I felt was exorbitant, but it was my first time so I didn't know better. The service could be better; I was afraid to raise my hand to ask for something because one of the waitresses looked really annoyed.",g-P058qnhLVXnEZYKBaVug
Nara Thai,nara-thai-singapore,"Spending around $15 to dine at a restaurant at ION Orchard seems to be a very very affordable- I know. During my visit I had Kao Kra Pao Nua ($14.90), which is a stir fried minced beef with chilli & hot basil served with blue jasmine rice. Overall dish was so bland... Just when I thought any dish couldn't be even more bland than mine, my partner's dish came it was so strikingly unbelievable I almost burst out laughing. He ordered Kao Phad Kung Fried rice with prawns $14.90 and seriously not just the taste was SO bland (wayyy bland than mine), it only came with 3 small prawns.. Service was bad. I guess that must be due to the fact that it was a full house when we came. It took quite sometime before someone took our order. It was amazing to witness the long queue every day at this place.. Even the food at Food Opera (the food court at B4) was much nicer... and way cheaper too!Price is subject to GST & Service charge. Water is not free. Will not come back again.",kszt8vOPh4xos8OtOqmr5Q
Nara Thai,nara-thai-singapore,"Tried this place with the Entertainer app. ""Nicer"" Thai restaurant with more refined food, but ultimately doesn't taste any better than Golden Mile. We ordered a basil pork with rice and a beef kuay Teow and a plate of veggies. Just basics to test the place out. Jasmine rice comes dyed blue, which is a nice visual touch but adds nothing otherwise. Basil pork was very spicy, to the extent it radiated through my head and numbed my mouth. Tasted nice enough.Disappointed that the fried egg was well-done as I always like a runny yolk with my Thai food. According to the waiter it's how the Chef always does it. Nonetheless, big minus for me...Kuay Teow was nice enough without being spectacular. Service was good and the waitresses were very pleasant in a ""Thai way"". Even with the entertainer, the few dishes came up to $42 which probably wasn't worth it. If you want good Thai food for half the price, go to Aroy Dee onMiddle Rd instead.",1cZkSCFPon7CiQTVkP7fuA
Nara Thai,nara-thai-singapore,It was my first time trying this place which was highly recommended by my friend who said that it's the best Thai restaurant she has eaten at in Singapore. Menu was quite extensive and price was higher than average. I decided to splurge a bit and tried the claypot of vermicelli with tiger prawns. The vermicelli has infused the essence of the fresh prawns and the portion was satisfactory. The iced milk tea was disappointing though. We asked if it was possible to have a less sweet version and were surprised when the waitress said we could give such an order. The tea that got served was still too sweet and definitely not worth S$5.90 before tax. My friend ordered stir fried vegetables and some of them were rather hard. Overall still a positive experience.,pDk2mjq7RTpIc6AWIvrbfw
Nara Thai,nara-thai-singapore,"Disclaimer: I lived in Bangkok for 5 years until 2013 and I am a rather picky eater.The whole family was experiencing withdrawal symptoms over the weekend, so we decided to get takeout from Nara Thai. I am not a fan of Thai Express as they put MSG in almost every food item, so this was - I felt - the next best alternative. I ordered:1. Morning glory 2. Pad Thai3. Stir fried sliced beef4. Chicken satay5. Chicken wrapped in pandanus leafThis was for 3 of us, and it was enough for 4 (I had the leftover from dinner the next morning). The star was the Pad Thai - having attempted this dish several times at home, I know how challenging it is to get the spices just right. This tasted exactly how it would back in Thailand at the Erawan Team Room where I used to diner almost Every. Single. Day. (I kid you not - they still remember my name and order whenever I go). The morning glory and sliced beef had too much gravy for my liking. It could have been ""drier"" and would have enhanced the taste. It also was a little bit too spicy. Chicken wrapped in pandanus leaf was tender and the spices were delicious. My mother had two helpings - a rare sight. Chicken satay was a little too tense.. it tasted good, but I assume that it was on the grill for perhaps a few minutes too long. I do recommend this place, though.",vOlPtKtcYDKopg9esopUCw
Nara Thai,nara-thai-singapore,"I came for lunch on a weekday.I had Set C - $13.90++ for Ayutthaya Boat Noodles, with Fried Sesame Chicken. I also added on Pandan Chicken, Thai Fish Cakes and Coconut Ice Cream with Red Rubies, as well as an Anchan Cooler.The Anchan Cooler is a premium drink - at $2.90 it, together with the Roselle (Hibiscus) Cooler, is more expensive than the Lemongrass or Pandan Coolers. The taste is not for everyone - it had a vaguely plum-y taste, with a sour note.The Fried Sesame Chicken came in the shape of 3 rather small pieces, which seemed to be mid-wing joints. The pieces were slightly dry, but that's not unusual for this kind of fried chicken and the dish was a decent appetiser.The Pandan Chicken unfortunately hardly tasted of Pandan, was a little dry and the two pieces we got were quite small too (relatively small servings seem to be a hallmark of this place - or at least its weekday lunch sets). Given that many other places (even much cheaper ones) can do decent Pandan Chicken, this is quite surprising (and even unforgivable for such an upscale joint).The fish cakes were pretty good - moist and flavourful.Happily the main event - the Ayutthaya Boat Noodles - was really good. The soup was full of flavour (it didn't seem to just be the MSG) and the pork balls were quite bouncy, tasty and juicy. And everything was topped with crispy fried bits, which added a contrasting texture to the dish (and even more taste to the stock). The slices of pork were a little too tough though. The soup was so good that I slurped it all up - even though I normally don't finish spicy soups.I ended off with Coconut Ice Cream. Virtually all Thai Coconut Ice Cream I've had is bursting with flavour, and this didn't disappoint. It was a little too melted when I got it, so ideally they'd store it at a lower temperature so it reaches the customer still-frozen, but that's a minor point. What made this version stand out was the Red Rubies - they tasted fresher than other Red Rubies I've had, and had a particular note to them (possibly more water chestnut).While I'm giving it 4 stars, an important caveat is that this was for the lunch set price. I had a look at the a la carte menu and it made my eyes open wide. If the quality of those dishes is similar, I would take this down a star to reflect the relatively poor value (you're better off going to other Thai places to get bang for your buck).",fBL9s_Cym7VJ3AY7Ioeaqw
Nara Thai,nara-thai-singapore,"Thai food that seriously stands out. Originally hailing from Bangkok, Nara Thai has recently opened a branch here in Singapore. My husband and I love Thai food and the only other authentic place we've been able to find in Singapore has been Folks Collective. So we were ecstatic to try out Nara as well. We started off with the salmon tartar salad with Thai herbs, which was extremely flavorful and paired well with the crunchy veggies they give you on the side. Pomelo salad was good, but a bit on the sweet side.  We also tried the butterfly pea juice, which was tangy and nice..tasted similar to roselle juice to me.  For our main we ordered the stir-fried soft shell crab with yellow curry. This dish knocked our socks off! It was very rich and indulgent, maybe a little too sinfully delicious :) We paired this with the thai herbs fried rice.  The rice was really good but a bit steep at $10 for just one scoop. Next time I might just get the jasmine rice ($2.50), although we really wish they offered red or brown rice like most of the places in Bangkok seem to do for a more healthy alternative. Also, thumbs up for friendly and smooth service, even on opening weekend :)",velzbr5_h-6xhr-o4mn4sQ

The waiter puts every coming dishes at the empty place without announcing which set the dishes belong to.

Nara Thai,nara-thai-singapore,"I had lunch here on Tuesday. Was a bit skeptical at first because of the mixed reviews it got.

Some kind of pork from the appetiser sectionSadly, we didn't order the Tom Yum Soup - don't know why but know i realise it was a pretty dumb move... ahahaThe food came out surprisingly fast and nearly everything arrived at the same time. We absolutely love the food here despite the mixed reviews we read. I think my favourite would have been the deep fried sea bass, broccoli and the morning glory. The pork had a bit too much fat on it. But other than that, my family and i really enjoyed our meal here.Our total bill came to $100 ++ which is usual for our family of 5. Although the customer service was a bit poor at first, i would definitely return. :)",kYplHDg9iYqLOU2-NLsNow
Nara Thai,nara-thai-singapore,"Overall, the food is pretty ok. Not sure if it's really the best Thai restaurant in Bangkok. The tom yum kung and sea bass dishes are a bit too salty.Pad thai is nice. The chicken breast pieces are tasteless though.Service is fast. The plate given to me is not clean. Dried pieces of food is still firmly stuck on it.",wH-yhddRO8Uc2e4kjwf1RA
Nara Thai,nara-thai-singapore,"After a dip in quality of food and service, Nara seems to have rebounced, although it is much less full than when it first opened.

Nara Thai,nara-thai-singapore,"Thai cuisine is one of my favorite foods and I have tried most of the Thai restaurant in Singapore. This is one of the best Thai restaurants in Singapore. The food is super yummy, staffs are friendly and attentive and atmosphere of the restaurant is very good. We went there for family dinner with my wife, my mom-in-law, and brother-in-law. We ordered Papaya salad with shrimp, Clear seafood tom yum soup, mixed vegetables, shrimp cakes, tom yum fried rice and fried soft shell crab with garlic. Fried soft shell crab with garlic is super delicious and it is one of the must-try dishes. All the foods were served within a reasonable time. The price is at a bit high sided and the portion of foods is not very much. However, the quality of food is superb and they are absolutely delicious. I would definitely go there again and whoever love Thai food should try there.",aHnaKCWFazTC5PbSt5uW4A

The sautéed morning glory is really delicious and flavorful, the chicken basil rice set is decent (aside from the rice being blue for no reason) .. It's a pretty legit place. My only little gripe about this place is that they took forever to bring out the water .... It's water. It's not like they have to make it.",6kEfVfKfJQo38jFqVfk9CA
Nara Thai,nara-thai-singapore,"Nara Thai supposed to be the best Thai restaurant in Thailand but I beg to defer. I was there last week and the food was rather....disappointing. Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't bad but it just doesn't live up to my expectation as THE best Thai food from Bangkok.As a starter, we ordered the Assorted Nara Hors d'oeuvre and the Rice Crackers with Pork&Prawns Coconut Dip. Out of the 3 items from the assorted platter, I only liked the fish cakes. The rice cracker was interesting, but not fantastic.For mains, we had the Stir-fried Soft Shell Crab in Yellow Curry, Tom Yum Kung, Stir-fry Kale in Oyster Sauce, Basil Minced Pork, Phad Thai, Pineapple Fried Rice and Braised Noodle in Oyster Sauce.The supposedly signature Soft Shell Crab in Yellow Curry was forgettable. The crab was tiny and not crispy, while the sauce was too thick. My friends joked that the curry tasted like the Twisties curry seasoning.Do not every order the Braised Noodle! It was deep-fried hor fun with oyster sauce. The hor fun was fried till crispy and the sauce was tasteless. The only saving grace was the Tom Yum Kung. It was a pretty big serving with big prawns. The soup was the right level of sour+spicy-ness.I don't think I will come back again. If you happen to be in Orchard and looking for good Thai Food, my suggestion would be walk further down to Orchard Tower. There are many small stores serving authentic Thai food there.",Ms9qgxOyQ8ul_WVJk4_Z3Q
Nara Thai,nara-thai-singapore,"I would say the food is good but not the service and cleanliness, lipstick stain on the glasses, leftover rice on the bowls, why? The restaurant is too dark.

Add a higher watt of yhe light, trust me your place will get more crowded a little.waitress face not interested no idea they are sleepy because its dark or simply they are just unhappy.I like their curry crab. It will be better if they can make big fresher crab than soft shell battered crab. Tom yum is good. Som tum portion is too small. Vegetable dish is all sweet and boring there.",k3qoYekjAhO1UpwRdgzdYg

Deciding to continue with the spicy theme started at Aromas of India, this small Thai restaurant in the basement looked promising, and indeed I wasn't disappointed. The friendly hostess took my order on her iPad and in short order I received the assorted hors d'oeuvres, comprised of tasty Satay, shrimp cups and eye-watering Larb Tord pork balls. Next up was soft shell crab pad Thai and green curry rice with salted egg, both exceptionally yummy (and not especially salty). The parent restaurant in Bangkok is highly regarded, and clearly the tastes have been transferred to this outpost in Singapore.",kJTb9JGu3mAK9I0zBCTp1Q

The steamed prawns with garlic was just flat out not good. Can easily tell the prawns were not fresh. The texture was completely mushy on every single piece. The only decent plate was the veggie, which is incredibly hard to mess up. Should have known something was to since there was only 3 tables occupied at close to peak hours. Disappointed at the overall quality of this place, especially since it was a short hike getting to this place.",PMMcGelLIQEF_7mILSBkJA
Ubin Kitchen,ubin-kitchen-singapore-3,"THIS PLACE. How did it take so long for us to realise how awesome it is?!They're a seafood restaurant but they also do meat dishes pretty well. A lot of their main dishes take time to prepare (it could be a half hour wait, or even longer during peak dining hours) but the wait is seriously worth it.If you're already hungry, I'd start with the salted egg fried fish skin appetizer. WARNING: These are extremely addictive. Crispy, just the right amount of salt, and not at all fishy. Almost like potato chips.They even have a chicken rice stall within the restaurant, so you could order from them if you need something to hold you over while you wait.The crab dishes here are fantastic. We've tried the steamed crab with hua diao wine, and the steamed crab with glutinous rice. If I had to choose, I'd go with the glutinous rice, because that in itself is already delicious.Last but not least, I really love their kou rou bao (steamed buns with marinated braised pork belly.) Again, this dish takes time to make, but DAMN SON. The pork is so tender and the sauce is boss.This is a great spot to go to if you have a big group, as the round tables can fit about 8 people each. Plus, the portions are big here, so they're meant for sharing.",nzIq7_i0C79ToOp-U5e0fA
Ubin Kitchen,ubin-kitchen-singapore-3,"Solid traditional Chinese/Teochew fare at good prices along Joo Chiat Road.First, this place is not to be confused with the other restaurant named ""New Ubin"" and other similarly titled establishments adopting the name of Singapore's rural offshore island. This place opened along Joo Chiat Road a couple of years ago under the name ""Ubin Seafood"" owned by the people who formerly ran the original seafood restaurant on Pulau Ubin.To further add to the confusion, in 2012 there was a change of management, and the name of the place changed from ""Ubin Seafood"" to ""Ubin Kitchen"". Chatter on the internet forums tells me that the head chef from the original Ubin establishment still helms the kitchen.Complicated history aside, it's possible to rattle off a laundry list of signature dishes that one should order:Steamed crab & glutinous rice (for 3-4 persons at $58)Bamboo ClamsOyster Hokkien NoodlesSteamed belly pork buns (Kou Rou Bao)fried shrimp rolls (hae zhor)salted egg yolk squidfried rice noodles (bee hoon)In particular, the oyster noodles were tender and had a hearty sauce, old school style. You see clams in the photo but there's some oysters somewhere hiding beneath the noodles. The pork buns were a DIY affair, fluffy steamed buns arrive separate from the pork and you'd have to create your pork sandwich yourself. All in all, I had a pretty good dinner.If Dorothy was Singaporean, she'd exclaim that ""We're not in Ubin anymore!"". I'm just glad I don't need to make it out across the water to eat the good stuff.",SzJ3Fcmj_qFTI5_JrMhZEw
Ubin Kitchen,ubin-kitchen-singapore-3,"Ubin Kitchen is a FANTASTIC Teochew restaurant on Joo Chiat Road. My wife and I came here on Deepavali and decided to try some of the restaurant's specialties, namely the Kou Rou Bao (aka the ""Chinese Burger"" as indicated by our kind server) and the steamed Crab doused in hua diao wine and ginger.Kou Rou Bao was just stunning. The steamed buns came hot and fresh, while a separate plate held five slices of marinated braised pork belly. A a bit of a Do-it-yourself burger where you take a strip of pork belly put it inside a steam bun. If you'd like, you can also add a strip of lettuce to make it the more ""healthy."" :PAs for the steamed crab, it was nothing short of special. This is not just some crab you put in a steamer and that's it. Nope, these crabs have a sophisticated flavour that blends hua diao wine with the juices of the crab. Wow. While all the crabs in Singapore focus on Chili Crabs or Pepper Crabs, it was nice to try something different for a change.Overall, the food at Ubin Kitchen was fantastic! Food wise, I'm of the view that it's 4.5 stars, but have settled on 4 stars since the server did not inform us that we would have to wait 30 minutes for both dishes.",anrZv1OM1a2sC_EfZ8mt-Q

Ubin Kitchen,ubin-kitchen-singapore-3,"Here's where I've been eating since they first opened 4-5 years ago. They have now changed hands, but the perennial favourites here are the salted egg yolk squid and the fried bee hoon. These two have to be on the table every time I patronise . What I enjoy is the service here. Whether it is to eat in or take away, service crew is helpful and courteous. If I am waiting for my take away, they would offer me barley to drink while waiting. The prices are affordable and family friendly. Portions are generous. Usually with 5 dishes for 7 people, I would expect to pay $80+. They can be quite packed during the weekend nights, otherwise during lunch, they should have spaces for groups.If you are a true blue teochew or just a lover of fried prawn rolls, they do it really well here too!",raKY29o3cqaQYcFdR_bZdg

It turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. The steamed crab is cooked in hua diao wine and ginger. The flesh of the crabs was really sweet and juicy, and they had an excellent bite to them showing that the crabs were very healthy and fresh. This one is amazing.Another dish that we tried was the salted egg squids, and this one was really nice as well. Overall, you simply cannot go wrong with most of the dishes in this seafood restaurant.

Tasty, crispy and delicious.We also have the Hokkien mee (noodles).  Not sure how Hokkien meeting should taste like - I'll reserve judgement when I have more experience ( Ie. eat more)The server suggested that we try their Porkchop and Spring Rolls.  We declined since we were trying to limit our intake of deep fried food.  I'm guessing that the 2 items we declined to order could be delicious given how delicious the Salt Egg Bitter Mellon tasted.I highly recommend Nan Hwa Chong for a novel (for non SE Asians or non Chinese) visiting Singapore.Service was fast, friendly and efficient.",cwZ64E_XT92XesWkQh85YQ

Nan Hwa Chong Fish Head Steamboat Corner adopt the use of charcoal instead of the ususal gas can operated steamboat pot. It is said that the use of charcoal to fire up the broth gave a smoky flavour and an even heat distribution to the broth itself.Location is rather prominent as it is located at the traffic junction. However, one thing that one might be worrying if driving would be the parking spaces.Not long after we settled down, we notice the constant stream of patrons walking into the shop. Everyone who walks in were promptly attended by the server. Most who came in had already made reservation via phone call before hand and they were directed to the air conditioned corner of Nan Hwa Chong.Seeing this station as the toughest job of all standing in front of the flames ensuring that the charcoal are evenly burn and stuffing them into the every steamboat that comes out from the kitchen.Supposed to be their recommended egg dish, however we got it served with the middle part burnt. Nevertheless the texture still remains fluffy and taste ordinary with a handful of oysters.The plate of stirred fried broccoli is my kind of home cook dishes. The light taste of broccoli greens is cooked with carrots, ginger and button mushrooms with minced garlic.We had chosen the grouper fishboat. The grouper fish comes from the sea-bass family.It is low in fat and cholesterol with firm texture and mild flavour. A healthy choice that does not compromise in taste. Three other types of fish offered will be Pomfret, Song Fish Head and Snapper Fish.Grouper Fish Medium Pot - $35Ingredients include fish, vegetables, seaweed, fried taro, flat fish, white cabbage and grouper fish. Soup is rich and sweet.While the cloudy soup may be made up by the yam, unlike other places they were done by adding milk to it. If you are wondering about the familiar taste in the stock, its the generous portions of flat fish added to the soup that gave a different taste to it.Not only that the fried yam added had also elevated the soup taste.Simply love dabbing the fish meat into this sweet sour and spicy chilli.If you love traditional fish steamboat with charcoal, Nan Hwa Chong Fish-Head is a very good choice.

They did however take over the unit beside them and have a small air-conditioned area.Parking seems to be quite the problem here though like others have mentioned so do take note about that or just park further away and be prepared to walk a bit. Oh and they do close quite late! Most of the staff seem to speak Chinese with very little english so communication may be a slight problem if you don't speak the language. Maybe to avoid grumpy staff scolding you when they're busy, come for supper when it's less crowded? Haha.. it does get pretty hectic during dinner time!

Mango lassi was creamy and just the right balance of sweetness and acidity.The fish curry was ""tua kong"" (really really good), extremely spicy for my moderately tolerant palette but so worth it.

True Blue Cuisine,true-blue-cuisine-singapore,"This is my all-time favorite Peranakan restaurant in Singapore.  From the moment you spot the storefront it's like a journey back in time.  The beautiful white orchids greet you as you pass through the small door into the entrance way.  There you start to immerse yourself in the gorgeous surrounding of a heritage Peranakan shophouse.  Last night we dined with a couple of friends of my cousin who are in town for business.  Luckily they are adventurous eaters.  They did have trouble finding it but seemed to enjoy the plush surrounds.  We sat in the corner with a full view of the restaurant and the china collection cabinet.  We ordered our favorites: the banana blossom & cucumber salad, sweet potato leaves, okra in candlenut sauce, black nut chicken, fried chicken in Indonesian spices, and beef rending.  The dishes came out of the kitchen at a steady pace.  Rice and tea were refilled plentifully.  I drank so much of the red date & longan tea that I had a mild sugar high mid meal. I cannot speak highly enough of the banana salad.  I have never been able to identify the banana blossom in the dish but the sauce is so good I don't really care what is in it.  I usually polish off the dish myself while people focus their attention elsewhere.  Like hollowing out their black nuts and chicken.  This is another stunning dish here.  The chicken is infused with more of the black nit flavor than other versions of this dish I have tasted.  The beef rending is simply superb.  I don't care for fried chicken but our guests fought over the last piece so it must have been delicious. plates clean the dessert came: pineapple tarts and some mango puree and pomelo for me. I hadn't gotten enough of pomelo from the juice which was amazing.  The pineapple tarts are homemade and you can tell.  Our guests commented that it didn't taste like pineapple at all. Either way, they ate them with delight.  We sat for a long time after the meal in deep conversation about the country.  The atmosphere in this restaurant makes you want to talk about important things.  After holding the table for over two hours we departed.  But it won't be long before I'm back for that salad.",L7zt8jZEE1Xj3ZT2fgO79w
True Blue Cuisine,true-blue-cuisine-singapore,"5-star setting, pity about the foodTrue Blue is possibly the prettiest Nonya matriach in town. Gorgeous artwork such as the beaded slippers are displayed in one of the rooms, while another houses a breathtaking array of lace blouses. The ground floor seating area is the main hall, while a few private rooms upstairs and one on the ground floor are popular for wedding ceremonies and private events.Pity then that the food and service appear indifferent and lacking in soul. Ayam buah keluak was the best dish, while everything else really failed to exhibit depth of flavour. The beef rendang was tough and barely warm when it hit the table, the chap chye watery. Prawns petai style were not fresh and lacked in sambal. Oh and if you want extra sambal, you will have to pay for it. Not surprising then with the small sizes of the dishes that the bill quickly adds up. Desserts were overhyped; the ""best pineapple tart in Singapore"" was mediocre with its dried out jam centre not yielding any moistness.This is a really beautiful restaurant to bring overseas guests, but only the connoisseur will know that there are smaller, more boutique Peranakan restaurants serving far better quality dishes.",HUodv8WGv4xo7EabaN3dqQ

The service is pretty good here too, and for Singapore that's saying a lot.  They are always on top of orders, get food out efficiently and usually at the same time as everyone at the table.  We drive half way across the island for this place.  Hands down the best Thai food in town.",xD3kKX0XZsvrDd24tf6MSQ
Yum Cha,yum-cha-singapore,"Protip:- Location: The restaurant is located on the second floor. The first floor only has a red door and a small sign. -  Solid Dim Sum Restaurant that passed the test. - Recommend the Steam BBQ pork buns and Fried Sweet Potatoes with Scallop. Yum Cha is a decent dim sum restaurant that you would visit if you were craving it and nearby. The ambience is a little on the upscale side but with reasonable prices.    If you do decide to visit, the location can be a bit tricky. It's located on the second floor with only a door and small sign on the first floor (Sandwiched between two gift shops, You can look through my photos for the sign. The restaurant itself is pretty huge for SG standards and able to accommodate multiple huge parties. When you sit down, you're given a menu to order your dim sum items. There aren't any food carts they push around. However, the service was slow, so you should expect to wait and extended period of time to receive your food. (Average 30 mins, minus a star there). The food itself i must admit was delicious. I ordered the following:- Steamed BBQ pork  (Recommend)- Crystal Chieves  dumpling - Fried Sweet Potatoes w/scallop    (Recommend)- Xiao Long Bao- Rice Porridge w/Century egg- Lotus leaf Rice    Keep in mind the portions are smaller than your typical Dim sum restaurant.  So if you're starving, you should order one extra one. Lastly, they tend to nickel and dime you with the tea and for the wet napkins. Overall, I would visit again.",mqxwq4sqdI8lf1iHD2aQRw
Yum Cha,yum-cha-singapore,"Located in the heart of Chinatown is Yum Cha, a well known chinese restaurant for thei dim sum and other heart-warming chinese delicacies. Yum Cha also sells seafood dishes like signature salted egg prawns and even chilli crabs. They've been at this location for the past 16 years, and they also provide delivery services.For the upcoming Mother's Day in May, Yum Cha has created a new concept that will be avaialble from 1st-14th May at Yum Cha Chinatown and Yum Cha Changi outlets. Their goal is to re-create the long-lost taste of traditional Chinese dishes that mother and grandmothers would remember with nostalgia of their hometowns.1. Braised Pork with Preserved Vegetable Bun $2/BunA nostalgic classic dish, this delicious bun, which was eaten for days while our ancestors were fleeing the war in China before settling down in different parts of Asia. The quality tender pork belly is braised in Yum Cha's secret recipe sauce for hours to create a sweet and succulent taste that is balanced by a soft and fluffy steamed bun.This is quite a different kind of bun as it is pillowy and has a slight fragance to it. The meat was indeed juicy, tasty and I can imagine getting about 3 of these in a go. Definitely don't miss this!2. Fish Maw with Shrimp PasteThis was an interesting dish that I had never tried before. The shrimp paste itself was a huge generous serving and it was extremely tasty going with the sauce on the dish. The fish maw was soft and jelly like, adding a light texture to the meaty shrimp paste.3. Pan Fried Salted Fish Bun $5 for 3 piecesYet another traditional chinese dish originating from the Guangdong provnice, this salted fish bun used to be a favourite of the Emperor Kang Xi  of the Qing Dynasty. The bottom bun is seared to a golden brown, with a flavourful filling made from salted fish paste and minced meat. To enhance its flavour, Yum Cha has added a secret seasoning for a more savoury experience. This was one of my favourites of the night. The bun was soft and pillow but yet had a slight crisp on the edges. The salted fish wasn't too salty and was perfect for my taste buds. 4. Pumpkin, Yam, and Golden Cake $4.80 for 3 pieces *highly recommended*A very pretty dish was served with this flower. The exterior of the golden cake was definitely beyong my expectations. It was extremely crispy, biscuit-like and biting into it, you will taste the moist yam and the sweet pumpkin in the center. A pretty ingenious sweet dish in my opinion. Definitely don't miss this. It's not that sweet, it was more of a savoury dish.5. Signature Salted Egg PrawnsI was waiting all night to try this. This was a huge serving of fresh and crunchy prawns. In the center, was a salad that had the salted egg sauce. This was a very different presentation than what we normally see, whereby the prawns are deshellled and cooked in salted egg sauce. 6. Black Pepper Lotus Beef (Large, $48)I loved the presentation of this dish, delicate and beautifully plated. The lotus were thinly sliced and were crisp like a potato chip. The vegetables added some colour to the black pepper beef. The Black pepper beef wasn't spicy at all, which is great for non-spicy eaters such as myself. The beef itself was extremely tender, soft and juicy.  The beef itself is imported from Brazil!7. Crab Meat Xiao Long BaoMy personal favourite dim sum is xiao long bao and Yum Cha's rendition of this delicacy is pimped up with crab meat. Picking it up with chopsticks usually requires some skill so as to not burst the delicate xiao long bao skin. But I could pick it up with ease and even hold it up for a period of photo taking. The skin itself isn't paper thin, but when biting into the xiao long bao, you can enjoy the soft texture of the skin and behind it, you find a very savoury soup and chunk of meat embedded in the xiao long bao. 8. 7 Flavour TofuThis was a very interesting tofu. Everyone at the table tasted different flavours. The tofu itself was soft, almost like a steamed egg. With a light crisp tofu skin with sweet, salty and even spicy flavours from the seasoning on top of the tofu.9. Fried Vermicelli SeafoodThe vermicelli had tons of wok-hei which made this a favourite at the table. Yum Cha was extremely generous with the ingredients that it only took us moments to devour this entire plate of goodness. The noodles were stir fried in prawns, scallops, vegetables and fish slices.10. Almond Tart $3.20/3 pieces *highly recommended*Yum Cha's classic almond tart has a soft and flaky texture. In the center, you will find a smooth almond custard that is not too sweet and just right for it's size. It can served chilled and its sweet taste will be a hit with children!I'm a pastry buff and I know it when I eat excellent pastry. The pastry shell has the perfect level of crisp to it and every bite was perfect. My only regret was that I did not get any of these Almond Tarts to-go to share with my family. The almond fillings absolutely melt in your",H8mXfh5XgGCqmMLwVH7k5A
Yum Cha,yum-cha-singapore,"The restaurant was located at the second floor of the shophouse. Although it was weekday, it was packed with lots of tourists. Menu was a single 2 sided tick list. I was showed to a table by the window. Although there was power under the table, it was not working. So don't plan to charge your hp while eating.Pumpkin Yam Golden Cake 金瓜竽丝糕 (S$4.20++/ 3pcs)The texture was not bad with its crispy top, but it was a tab jelat if having more than a piece and quite oily towards the end. Taste was one dimension.Squid Ink Dumpling 顺鼓墨鱼饺 (S$4.80++/ 3pcs)The folds wasn't perfect. One piece wasn't even folded in.Yum Cha Prawn Dumpling 饮茶虾饺皇 (S$5.20++/ 3pcs)There's holes in the dumplings. I was surprised to find this kind of standard in their signature dumplings.Home-made Almond Tea 杏仁茶 (S$4.20++)The texture wasn't rich and creamy. It looked kind of like the instant type - sweet and lumpy. Service was spotty. I was told to go to the cashier when I asked for the bill. I could spot customers with their bills served to them at their tables. Also spotted that the next table of Japanese customers had a piece of plastic in his glass of beer. The staff who cleared the glass blamed on the plastic covering the ice cubes, but did not apologize. One could see clearly that the group of customers was clearly upset. Although the customer was later told by another staff that the glass of beer would be waived from the bill, the damage had already been done.",2F38Uc4UNNbFVdyUUnBjOA
Yum Cha,yum-cha-singapore,"Went here on a recommendation from a local.  Second floor of an older building in Singapore's Chinatown. Looked through the menu and noted two dishes (Black Squid Ink Dumpling, Pomelo Sago Dessert) that we did not recognize and have not had in our 50+ years of Dim Summing.  Really 45+ years since the wife and I did not start at birth.  LOL.  So we definitely ordered in addition to staples of Siu Mai, Har Guo, Pai Guet - Spare Ribs, and Mango Sago. All ranged from $4-5SD.The dishes were all tasty and had three items for each dumpling.  Tea filled constantly - approximately $2SD per person.  Small peanuts shared at $1SD per person - standard minimum charge.  In total, six dishes cost us $40SD.  A little pricey for Dim Sum....",Aq1mWb2K3b-Rpko5HG5TSw

Not sure if that's the loom the owner was going for, if not, it does need some TLC. Servers need some customer service skills or training. Don't make you feel very welcoming. The dim sum was good, but a bit overpriced in my opinion especially for a Small plate of fried rice. The Siew Mai compared to the states, is very small and only 3 pieces. Last but not least, if u do not want to lose your appetite, visit the restroom after eating, and definitely not before. I'm a strong believer all restaurants should hv their staff clean the restrooms frequently, if not every 30 min, at least hourly.",7SD5B_LR7cY1-vf8fDVvWw
Yum Cha,yum-cha-singapore,"(1) Salmon Yu Sheng [$38+ sml / $68+ big]- Just like any other ""Lou Hei"", Yum Cha's version was not much difference from the rest with common ingredients such fresh salmon fish slices, crunchy jellyfish, shredded carrot, radish, ginger, yam, pomelo etc. Highlight of this dish was Yum Cha homemade sour plum sauce used for tossing. Made with their secret recipe, this homemade sauce gave a sourish sweet aftertaste. Paired together with their fish sauce, both made the whole plate of Yu sheng very tasty and appetizing. If you're a very 年年有""鱼"" person, you could add on more fish portions at only $12. HUAT ah!!Rating 5/5(2) Fried Crispy Chicken[$40+ whole]- Chicken was fried till golden brown color with slight crisp on the skin. I'm rather surprised that the meat texture was dry and tough even on the thigh part so I guessed the deep frying method dried out the meat. Marinades wasn't strong and flesh tastes rather bland, the only flavorful part was at the skin where the crispy garlic bits were scattered on top. You may want to dip the chicken in Yum cha's homemade sweet chillies sour plum sauce to bring more flavour to the meat. Rating 3/5(3) BBQ Suckling Pig[$220+ whole / $118+ half]- Crackling skin of this suckling pig made me gave up on my diet plans and went for more portions. Meat was flavourful with fats evenly distributed throughout the whole pig. It wasn't oily at all. Dip with a little of the smokey sweet sauce provided and it was heavenly! Although ""peng cai"" was more commonly seen on the tables during CNY than a ""suckling pig"" but for a change, I suggest you order this suckling pig instead. Skin so crispy its definitely worth all the calories. Rating 5/5(4) Braised Pig's Trotter with ""Fatt Choy"" [$38+ half leg]- Pork trotter was slow-braised till really soft and tender. Meat falls off from bone easily without me using any strength. Chinese spices was not strong and I suggest flavour can be heavier. Fatt choy (black moss) used did not help in the taste, only being a traditional auspicious ingredient as people always said ""fatt choy"" sounds like ""发财"" in mandarin. Dried oysters would be a better option to improve the overall taste of this dish.  My most love and also the best parts of this trotter were the jelly skin and tendons. They were so Q, packed with collagen and ""melt-in-the-mouth""!Rating 4/5(5) Fried Rice with Chinese Sausages in Lotus leaf [$38+ whole]- I'm quite disappointed with the inconsistency of this dish. Other than texture being dry, parts of the rice were undercooked. The other main, important ingredient ""chinese sausages"" were not much visible too because they were cut into micro cubes instead of slices which I felt the size was unnecessary. I totally could not taste their existence thus lack the aroma of preserved meat. Dried shrimps used were also very tiny although chef was generous to throw in a lot. Rating 1/5. Skip this.",cgMqDLZPOdUDqufAP8jyfg
Yum Cha,yum-cha-singapore,"Most Hongkongers are pretty sticky with the quality of dim sum here. So I took my cousins to this place at Chinatown as the quality versus price is a nice match.

This is a great deal, with a great selection of dim sum being wheeled past your table in trolleys. There's also a dim sum menu for making special requests, but the trolleys are quite comprehensive and come by very regularly.

Lana Cake,lana-cake-singapore-3,"Unlike my counterparts, I'm one of those who doesnt go crazy over chocolate.

Not sure what's the Lana equivalent for kids these days, but if I had a choice, I'd want my birthday cake to be a cheese cake, ice cream cake, or Lana's chocolate cake.Yes, it made my list. Lana existed way before awfully chocolate ever did, and I may be biased, but I think Lana's chocolate cake is still better than the ones by Awfully chocolate.Definitely call them up and order your cake, then pick it up from the shop on the day itself.

Lana Cake,lana-cake-singapore-3,"The most overrated cake in Singapore. I have been on a journey trying out different chocolate cakes islandwide and LANA, although the 'OG', proved to be the biggest disappointment. It's rather dry instead of the moist, and dense quality you'd expect of a chocolate fudge cake. It feels much like a chocolate chiffon cake similar to Swee Heng's Chocolate Fudge ($5) cake. Especially with the horrible texture of the fudge. The chocolate lacks in taste and feels more like a jelly than of a sinful fudge. I thought the hefty price tag of $55 for 800g would be worth since many has given it the title of the best chocolate cake, but it's nothing more than a rip off. I saw that only 4 years ago, they were charging $39 for the 800g, the price difference is monstrous. Would rather buy multiple Swee Heng cakes if I like that chocolate jelly in my cakes or buy from better stores like Choc-a-bloc or even that $20+ Qoo10 cake.",21uYcVHQ8uf9GIKrahY2VA
Lana Cake,lana-cake-singapore-3,"The last time I had Lana cake was years and years ago. Having a sudden craving for it, fueled by the news that she was selling off her recipe, I decided to try to get a cake. I called and couldn't get through so I dropped by to see if I could get a cake and found out that you have to make an order 7 days in advance. They're closed on Sunday and Monday. A bit later I decided I'd order a cake for Mothers' Day and called 10 times on a Tuesday (at 11am, 12pm and 3pm) before finally getting through around 5.30pm. $52 for 1kg, $2 extra for any wording on the cake.Fortunately, pick up, two weeks later, took 2 minutes and the staff were friendly.Unfortunately, the cake just wasn't worth the hassle. The bottom layer was dry and the cake just didn't live up to what I remembered, or the general hype. Since you can't walk in for a cake, it's not the place to satisfy a craving, and if I were ordering a cake I'd go elsewhere. The chocolate heaven cake from Lynn's Cake is better in my opinion - it's more moist - and you can get one large slice for $5.50. Get it for the nostalgic value I suppose, but not much else.",8-16ryk-5pdzUs_6cI_5aw

I absolutely did not want it, but since I just walked from Farrer Park station in the sweltering heat, I was leaving Lana's with a cake either eay - I would have paid someone else walking out of the door, even.My date cake was absolutely awesome and delicious - it was so smooth and just the right amount of everything - 5 stars all the way. What was not five stars was the lady's attitude who worked there. It was ATROCIOUS. So high and mighty she is, selling cakes, that she cannot even be bothered to answer questions. Let alone, listen to them. You can sell five star stuff but if you do not have a shred of decency you don't deserve five stars.

Lana Cake,lana-cake-singapore-3,"I used to study in the area and my mum would pick up cakes from here for special occasions or just because she felt like it. Usually, we would get their famous chocolate cake or carrot cake and it would be snatched up almost instantly at home. While Lana Cake has been branded as 'over-rated', I would beg to differ. Beyond sentimental value, there is something special about their chocolate cake that I still enjoy. While it could definitely be more moist, I enjoy their use of a lighter sponge cake over the heavier cake base most cake shops go for. Chocolate in itself is already a very heavy flavour, particularly with the dense fudge that is about to be laden on top, so it would be sickening if the cake was just as rich too and 'moist' in its higher density. Rather oddly, their fudge, made with a secret recipe, has a slightly gelatinous texture which makes it more enjoyable. I also like how their cakes tend to be less sweet than cakes from other places and taste distinctly home-made. Its direct competitor, Awfully Chocolate, has the closest tasting chocolate cake similar to that of Lana's and though the texture of the fudge is right, there is what can only be described as a 'plastic' taste.It is clear that I am still a fan of Lana Cakes, but be warned that the staff are not very pleasant at all and to check the opening hours before going. Also, calling in beforehand and booking the cake you want would be a good idea.",5av7ZYxifKl1jPttRSvt7Q

Lana Cake,lana-cake-singapore-3,"Everyone has to grow up having lana chocolate cake for their birthdays. I used to be jealous at my sister's huge dog shaped chocolate cake, but as I grew up, I realised the shape doesn't matter. When it comes to buttercream, the small details, no one beats Mrs Violet Kwan. You might not think it matters, but it does. I want to eat cake, and every bit of it, even the cream. The salty creamy texture of the buttercream at Lana means I can dig into it without picking out anything. So their cakes a old-fashioned with different flavours along with buttercream. Blueberry and walnut is really good. Cake eating is great, but what I enjoy most is just going into the cake shop. I love seeing the rolls of purple ribbon and seeing the veterans tying up boxes swiftly and beautifully.Not only just to see what they have left for me to take home other than their chocolate cake, I love taking that gold cake slice box with a piece of rich fruit cake.

Starbucks,starbucks-singapore-24,"Call me a Starbucks addict if you must, but it's not really the drinks that keep me coming back to Starbucks, but the location and the environment are the most important factors in choosing where to get that hot cuppa coffee, or where I should hammer that essay. The Delfi outlet that has recently been added to the Starbucks chain is my favourite thus far. Aside from the prime location in the heart of orchard road, what I like about this outlet is the laidback atmosphere of the cafe. Further, there are powerplugs freely available under the wooden tables both inside and outside. Aside from that, the long wooden table on the outside is perfect for group discussions. If you're feeling bored, sit by the ledge, and you can people-watch. There are many interesting characters around this part of town, where the infamous Orchard Towers is located at.

Not wanting to waste time, I decided to just visit the man and stop by this Starbucks in Delfi Orchard.As other reviewers have said, this outlet is in a prime location on Orchard Road. Not only do they have a spacious air conditioned interior, but they also have a nice covered patio if you'd like to be outside. But what makes this outdoor area better than Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf across the road is that 3 sides of the patio are enclosed in glass so there are less chances of pigeons flocking on the tables.Since they jump the gun here and start holiday season in October, I enjoyed sipping a peppermint mocha while mooching off the free wifi and getting some WERK done. Wifi expires every 30 minutes, so just be prepared to reconnect each time. My only complaint is that no one seems to bus tables here. When I arrived mid-day there were so many plates and dirty tables, and for the 1.5 hours I was there, not one employee went out to clean anything until I was about to leave.--*Judge me.

Starbucks,starbucks-singapore-24,"I like Starbucks, because they have a set of products and business model that work. This isn't a review as much as an amusing observation. My daughter loved getting the store made chocolate milk back in the States. We attempted to order that at a Starbucks here, and things went sideways. We got hot chocolate. I tried to explain that we just wanted cold milk mixed with chocolate sauce, and twice we were told 'yes, that is our signature hot chocolate.' A couple of minutes went by, during which time the poor staff appeared completely befuddled by my request, and finally asked if I would just like the SHC over ice...I succumbed and said yes. At least we had a good laugh about it, and picked up some chocolate syrup at the store that night.",FXCZyluW_sVpNynDPLCUsA

Bella Pizza,bella-pizza-singapore,"So, a New England native comes straight from Boston to live in Singapore. The first thing he notices: you can make buildings out of materials other than bricks. Several epiphanies later, he realizes that most of the pizza here is awful and exorbitantly overpriced.Relatively speaking to Singapore standards, Bella's pies are good, and though they're a bit more expensive than the average place, it's not the kind of shakedown you can expect from other spots in the area.

The flavored and presentation were very good, however I'm giving my this three stars because the gnocchi was over cooked to the point of being mush.

Bella Pizza,bella-pizza-singapore,"This is good pizza but I am not blown away by it. It is too thin for my tastes. It is like the pizza in France, or a little thicker than the pizza in Rome (but with a little worse cheese), both of which I consider inferior to pizza in Napoli. However, they may be catering to the Singaporean palette, and that would probably mean making a similar style of pizza as the early entrant Da Paolo. If this is true, they execute their efforts toward that goal very well.I am in love with Bella Pasta which is under the same ownership.The weekday lunch special is a steal. 18++ for a salad, a pizza, ice cream, and coffee or tea.",NyYZUEQBYU7D2EA_F9bObw

This loaf was off the hook. Each slice was filled with so many walnuts. So much that I wasn't sure if that was the case for every loaf, or if the baker had accidentally spilled a whole bag in.

Artisan Boulangerie Co.,artisan-boulangerie-co-singapore,"Have been here a few times. My usual is either the croissant or pain au chocolat. In my opinion based on visiting Parisian bakeries & eating thru many of NYC's best croissants, I'd have to say that ABC's croissant is better than Maison K & Tiong Bahru B. ABC's croissant is crisp on the outside and has a sound when you tap the exterior, while the inside has visible layers with a soft interior. Today I tried the eclair which I thought was one of their signature items. It was a bit disappointing bc did not taste authentic at all. Tasted like something I'd buy from the supermarket and not up to ABC's high standards. I've also had lattes a few times and noticed that the temperature was bordering warm to lukewarm. C'mon ABC, I know you can do better! :)",UEOgOAFIlH2vpGKNlGsDcA
Artisan Boulangerie Co.,artisan-boulangerie-co-singapore,"Fab decor and ambience but pastries are a bit meh. Came in on a Saturday for brunch and place was buzzing. The staff are all quite young, perhaps that's why they're all bustling very busily to little effect. Tried the boeuf bourguignon pie - dug in and found peas and potato. Perfectly ok but that's not boeuf bourguignon so they should just label it a beef pie lah. Have to say they're very generous with the beef and the chunks were tender, not chewy. Good quality balsamic on the accompanying salad.  The portobello sandwich had generous stuffing of well seasoned portobello, but it was cold. Would be much better warm. The chocolate croissant wasn't buttery enough although it was ok. Chocolate eclair wasn't too sweet but again ok, no great shakes. Best thing was a lemon curd tart with a bracingly tangy curd - but then again I can make lemon curd, so um not blown away. Long black coffee tasted a little sour like it'd been percolating a while so I'd advise coffee aficionados to go for the lattes and mochas which have to be made fresh.",wuRI6NhRB6cUWERRmcvOMQ
Artisan Boulangerie Co.,artisan-boulangerie-co-singapore,"The ambience, decor and gorgeous display of baked goods and pastries was what attracted me to ABC @ Somerset when I first stumbled across it. I had the latte and it was good. Subsequent visits to the Somerset and Asia Square outlets were really disappointing. I really wanted to like this place but the bread and pastries here are not worth the effort. On one visit I bought a loaf of bread after asking the staff to recommend one that was soft & fluffy in texture, instead it turned out to be dry and crumbly. On other visits, we have tried the pear tart, chocolate eclair (twice!), chocolate lava cake. The tart and lava cake were average, nothing to shout about. The eclair pastry was surprisingly dry and hard. I would rather pay a few more dollars to have a delicious Paul bakery eclair than waste my calories here. If you are looking for a chill out cafe to have a coffee and a chat with friends, this would be the ideal place..

Pine Garden’s Cake,pine-gardens-cake-singapore,"Pine Garden is a heartland boutique bakery with more than 30 years of history that continues to produce good old freshly-baked goods and they have recently started to come up with creative and innovative cakes like their infamous lychee martini and bailey's chocolate crunch.With the upcoming season of christmas, Pine Garden has created a few new log cakes that look traditional on the outside but not so traditional on the ingredient list.1. Mocha Santa House Log Cake ($58, 800g)This little santa house features a soft mocha sponge cake, layered with the Pine Garden's well-knwon rumball filling, dark sweet cheeries and coated with a light buttercream frosting. If you like a coffee aroma, this is the cake for you. Not to mention the chocolate house is so cute and adorable. It's almost like a gingerbread house look! The rumball filling was quite distinct and you could taste the rum! This was my favourite log cake amongst the 3.2. Mojito Pineapple Tropicana Log Cake ($45, 800g & $68, 1.2kg)Little is known about this cake as this seems to be a new creation from Pine Garden's bakery. This log cake consists of a tropical mix of Mojito Mint x Pina Colada cocktail cream, with some pineapples cubes and pineapple marmalade, all rolled up in a soft and moist vanilla sponge. This was a miss for me, as I couldn't really taste the mojito but you could smell the pineapple from the cubed pineapple. The taste wasn't so familiar either.3. Banana Salted Caramel Log Cake ($39, 800g & $59, 1.2kg)This log cake had a strong banana aroma, with the chocolate soft roll and salted caramel cream drizzled with more caramel sauce. This reminded me of their salted caramel swiss rolls with golden chocolate bits that I tried at AMK hub. The buttercream here is so addictive, along with the thick and sticky caramel sauce. This is their cheapest log cake and I feel that this is probably the easiest and safest choice of log cakes that Pine Garden has to offer if you are getting this for a friend or family!Verdict : Interesting log cake creations that can totally change your christmas party!",H8mXfh5XgGCqmMLwVH7k5A

Pine Garden’s Cake,pine-gardens-cake-singapore,"It's a shame that my acquaintance with Pine Gardens is through a friend who live in the far western part of SG when the confectionery is just a few bus stops away from my neighbourhood. :PThe ""culprit"" - their signature lychee martini cake. Visiting Pine Garden to me usually means that I'm visiting the doctor's cos the clinic that I go to is situated ard the corner. What better way to cheer myself up than to 'reward' myself with a slice of good cake.The texture of the cakes are light and fluffy but sometimes I wish there is just lesser cream and more substantial ingredients. The lychee martini cake is alright but what I'm attracted to more is the old school presentation and design of the cakes - simple and direct - you get what you see. (lychee means lychee cake, pulut Hitam means pulut Hitam cake, rainbow means rainbow cake)Pine Gardens probably stood out cos they venture into many different types of alcohol-infused flavours, something that is not found in a typical traditional neighbourhood confectionery.Post-clinic-visit treat can definitely be better if I don't need to scrape off the thick cream on top of the cake cos it's a tad too much. ;)",nbYBWghA9fWHz-0JokGotA
Pine Garden’s Cake,pine-gardens-cake-singapore,"This shop has been part of my childhood as I grew up around this area. Mom always buy their buns or cakes for breakfast. Whenever Mom asked me to pick a cake, i would excitedly pick my favourite cake, the one with rainbow stripes. So fluffy and colourful!Years later they came up with lychee martini cake ($2.60 a slice or is it $2.50?) and since then, I stopped buying other cakes except this. What I like about this cake are the always-so-fluffy sponge cake and the cream with tiny lychee strips. And this goes very well with tea. I saw some of their cakes, one of them was nuttymisu, featured on a Channel 8 show and they look so good. Gonna try to take my eyes off lychee martini for once and try those soon! ;)",g9iOyt4t7KukCIaTNhhOKw
Pine Garden’s Cake,pine-gardens-cake-singapore,"The highlight of this cake shop must be the Lychee Martini cake. While the cream is definitely on the heavier side (which may or may not be an issue with you), the flavours of the cake are certainly distinctive and fresh. As for the other offerings of cakes, I tried the Black Forest before but the cream layers were too thick. There was definitely more room for chocolate and cherries in there. However, the choice of flavours for the cakes is definitely something worth mentioning: from Moscato Soursop to Apple Vera Martini, those with a thing for alcohol might find the infusions here intriguing.In the lead-up to holidays like Christmas, you are recommended to call in and order early as demand is usually quite high. You can also order online at pgcake.com.Did I mention they do customised cakes? You can check out the range of designs on their website. Some of them are very tastefully done - while not as polished as cakes at Canele or Rive Gauche, they have a touch of uniqueness and simplicity that will speak to whoever you're celebrating with.",hC1HjO-Tye6dar3Bg0aZMw

Well-known organizations and individuals come from all over Singapore to order their cakes, which suit almost any occasion.

Pine Garden’s Cake,pine-gardens-cake-singapore,"I loveeeee this cake shop for just one and only ONE reason... Their signature Lychee Martini cake! This is one good enough reason that keeps me coming back for more! The cake is richly spread with cream that's filled with lychee goodness. Although creamy, it doesn't give the 'gelat' after effect that often happens with creamy desserts. Sandwiched between the soft sponge cake layers are a mixture of cream + real lychee. A hint of martini can be tasted between those layers too. One last word to sum  it up- HEAVENLY!The cake is best served cold, that is, to have it immediately after purchase or takeaway and chill it  in the refrigerator before eating. Located in the AMK neighborhood, facing the roads, I wouldn't say the ambience is great.  I would suggest taking away if you're looking to enjoy your cake in a nicer backdropPine Garden also do customized cake for birthdays, weddings etc. If you aren't satisfied with their in-house cake designs, feel free to provide your own.

I like that they give helpful advices as well, like for the colors and the kind of shape to choose, etc. The lychee martini cake is definitely a to-die-for. It's light and tasty. As simple as that! The black forest was so-so though, I had tasted better ones before. One thing I do dislike a little is the location. Because I stay in the east, having a self-collection was a little troublesome.

Karu’s Indian Banana Leaf,karus-indian-banana-leaf-singapore,"Friends of mine will know that Samy's and Karu's are my two favourite Indian restaurants in the west side of Singapore. I remember visiting Karu's for the first time during my student days, where I had the fish head curry (and what a fish head curry it was!) and how my brother went crazy with the free flow basmati rice - being the ""rice bucket"" he is. Thankfully, the standard has remain relatively consistent over the years, and the food here has not failed to disappoint. If you're a big fan of Indian food, you'll definitely want to give the Chicken Masala/Mysore dishes a try. The tandoori and Tikka dishes are also delightful, with every dish served in generous portions. Do take note that the restaurant will get VERY crowded on weekends and parking space is shared with the other restaurants in the area, making it very limited.

Fortunately, the crowd wasn't too overwhelming and we managed to find a seat quite soon.We sat down & instead of plates, we were quickly given a large banana leaf each, which is an authentic touch. The Veg White Rice Appalm set costs $2.80 per person. This means that for that price, one will enjoy a free flow of white rice, poppadom as well as side veggies. Very yummy. For our dishes, we ordered a Chicken Masala, a Fish Curry & an Onion Omelette ($2.00). The chicken masala was excellent and the masala sauce went very well with the chicken which was neither tough nor lacking. The fish curry, I felt, was excellent. It was really great with the rice & the poppadom. Overall, Karu's is an authentic indian restaurant that is a wonderful place for a meal.

Karu’s Indian Banana Leaf,karus-indian-banana-leaf-singapore,"Karu's is not very easily accessible, parking can also be quite a problem but its worth the hassle if you're craving for the bold flavours of indian food near the bukit panjang area - you just have to head towards upper bukit timah road and its along the shophouses on your left. Came here on a weekday evening and it was bustling. It's also air-conditioned so you can dine in comfort from the humid heat outside. They are known for their fish head curry but haven't tried that (not a fan of fish head) but I have had a go at their fish curry with their prata. It's finger-lickin good. I've also had their thosai, served warm it just melted like butter on my hot hungry appetite. I'm definitely coming back for their briyani, served authentic and old school style on a banana leaf!Final verdict: One of the best Indian food in the northwest!",kWpV8BiFGNRhpeHYXl_q6g

Although it's in a more ulu location, throngs of families still flock here, especially on the weekend as many come from the Hindu temple nearby. The restaurant feels very authentic and has a real bustling vibe. The service is super efficient and serving portions very generous, especially compared to other banana leaf places like Samy's which is probably more famous but honestly is outdone by Karu's food wise.

Karu’s Indian Banana Leaf,karus-indian-banana-leaf-singapore,"This is definitely worth checking out if you live in the West. I used to frequent this restaurant in my army days, where $3.50 would net you free flow of rice, curry and vegetables. The briyani is really authentic, with the rice pilaf served on banana leaves. You have the option of having fish or chicken curry - I would alternate between the two on different helpings. Service here is great too. One time, I shared a large bowl of fish head curry with some friends. At the end of the meal, we were very satisfied, but noted casually to the owner that the fish could have been slightly more fresh (or perhaps ours was just overcooked). We weren't expecting anything, and were about to leave, when they brought out a whole new plate of curry for us. We were astounded and promised we'd come back to do the place justice. Also worth trying is their chicken masala, and their bandung made with goat's milk. Great place for a casual, unassuming and air-conditioned fix of Indian food.",4Uf6g20S-2ZcxJSuvVIjJg

Al Forno,al-forno-singapore-2,"Al Forno definitely has a fan base, and I respect that. We stopped by during a public holiday and the restaurant was packed, so without a reservation we took a table outside.As there are a lot of Italian restaurants in the area to compare to, we chose the caprese salad to start. I went the pizza route by ordering their Pizza Al Forno (a specialty) while Migs tried one of their squid ink pastas.I wasn't too impressed with their caprese, considering it was $18. Their tomatoes were nothing to shout about, and the black olives didn't add much flavour either. I would've preferred kalamata olives instead.The Pizza Al Forno was very filling, and my takeaways fed me for 2 meals afterwards! It's halfway between a thin crust and thick crust. Toppings included mozzarella cheese, sausages, ricotta cheese, and spinach, yet I still felt that it could've had more flavour. Either a better tomato sauce, a good olive oil, or perhaps some red pepper flakes could help take it to the next level.Unfortunately service was very hurried and clearly the staff looked overwhelmed with all the guests in house. Once our food was served we could no longer get anyone's attention to deliver our check so we had to go in (twice) to get it.Not exactly the best first impression, but I'm willing to give them another try.",nzIq7_i0C79ToOp-U5e0fA
Al Forno,al-forno-singapore-2,"Everytime i pass by this resto always full. So finally tonight got a parking spot nearby, as i went there early. I had tagliatelle with tomato and lobster, kids had pizza, hubby had calzone, a friend of mine had meatballs penne. Everybody was happy with their meals, the portion also generous ( too much for my 13 yo kids). Mine pasta was fresh, well cooked, fresh sause also.Service was good and fast. Will definatelly return here and added this place to my list to go for dinner:)",62jyeuaoPpypSF9C2yncgQ
Al Forno,al-forno-singapore-2,"I have been a quiet fan of Al Forno's for about 20 years already (seriously, I'm that old). I remember my fondest dates here with my then-boyfriend-now-hubby and the food is STILL as good!Focaccia Blanca - we wanted a starter and its nice. Think it as a pizza base without the sauce and ingredients. It's fragrant and goes well with soup. It's also a hit with the kids.Calamari - the squid rings are nicely battered and fried but I would have liked them seasoned more. Though the rings are tender and crispy, its a little bland for me.Pizza Alforno - our first time ordering pizza. I love how moist the pizza tasted with the feta cheese and spinach toppings!Pizza Con Carne - essentially a meaty pizza with ham slices and salami slices. Hub likes it enough.Spaghetti Cartoccio - my all-time fav baked spaghetti with seafood. They serve it in a tin foil that you cut open to reveal its goodness. The seafood is fresh and generous in amount and the spaghetti cooked till al dente even when baked. Al Forno remains my favourite Italian restaurant of homage.",t5XN2Lmv_VeXRSw9YdGf_w
Al Forno,al-forno-singapore-2,"Good food and service. The fact that there were hardly any tables available on a Monday evening should be testament to how much people enjoy this place. Good value for money too! We had the lasagna, prosciutto pizza, and panna cotta. Family-friendly place as the servings were for sharing. Will definitely return to try other dishes.",GZxCOTWZ8hF5KrzMOSyddA
Al Forno,al-forno-singapore-2,Probably the best and most authentic pizza I have had on this side of the world. The beef filet was sheer perfection with the high quality delicious cut of meat!,xQ5ei5X-cfRX1sTHc0apSA
Al Forno,al-forno-singapore-2,"We came here for our company holiday party. Thank God I didn't need to pay a single penny bc if I did, I would have written a nasty review. Well, one that might be nastier than this one. Disgusting. Seriously, I don't think anyone at our table finished any of our food. Well, except for the appetizer consisting of mozzarella + Parma ham because to create that bad version of that dish would make this restaurant an Olive Garden. Al Forno hasn't hit rock bottom like Olive Garden, but it's close. Some things that were wrong: 1. My colleague's parmesan eggplant was just soaked with cheese - which in my opinion means that it wasnt fresh. The taste test proved my suspicion to be true.2. The seafood spaghetti (their speciality) was tasteless. I had 3 bites and was fed up. My colleague gave it a tried and gave me a face after his one bite. Yuck.3. My colleague's halah order was a simple take out box. They didn't even take the time to present it nicely. Fine, fine, BUT we had to ask at least 3 times to bring her food! Muslims need to eat too! 4. The service! Ugh. We had to repeat our requests many, many times. I'm not going to get into service in Singapore, but you know what I mean. The winning grace was the pizza, which I've had much better elsewhere.There are so many other better restaurants on East Coast Road. Pass on this one. Just pass.",3g_vgaCNlvR5uKmUkSz8Rw
Al Forno,al-forno-singapore-2,"When we walked into this place everything seemed wonderful this old east coast landmark has the look of an Italian tavern, the service was friendly, when the food came the portions were hearty, the food looked good but right from the appetizer to the soup, the pizza and the pasta nothing had flavor or character, it was all limp! And that was not because the Chef tried to make the food light or bland it's just that nothing seemed to click , it was just ok...It should have been 3 stars, the extra star is for the dessert (tiramisu) & coffee and the overall ambience since you do get the feeling of being in rustic (in a nice way) Italian tavern, but the prices btw are not of a rustic tavern!",ckwnqV51jh5cmcyAYVTU2A
Al Forno,al-forno-singapore-2,The food was very good. Probably one of the best pizzas I have ever had. The only downside was the table service was very poor and disorganised. I saw many customers walk away including some who made bookings but didn't have a table and were forgotten about.,nkoz7KpYFh0-FyhtGZk-kA
Al Forno,al-forno-singapore-2,"Al Forno is great if you;re looking to have a classic italian meal. I suppose the food's that good cos the chef is italian himself.I'm an east coast kid so obviously I;ve been to Al Forno's countless times and everytime I'm there, the food's just as good. It really doesnt matter if you order pasta or pizza and some other main course. The food is well cooked and you're greeted by classic italian flavours in every bite.One of the starters that I particularly enjoy are the clams in white wine sauce. They weren't sandy (which is very imp) and the sauce was white wine sauce was delicious. I'd highly recommend it if you're a seafood junkie.",J-NdrqdYuaBZnD8zo9pgjg
Al Forno,al-forno-singapore-2,"I heart Al Forno. It's buzzy, with frazzled wait staff at peak hours, and dishes up superb Italian. I haven't found a place that does pizza better than Al Forno yet. Not wafer thin crispy, not overly bready - it's the right balance of crunch, chew and char. I only ever order pizza when my go to pizza maker is around - he's the Italian dude in a thin white tee, with more hair on his arms than his head. It's a wonder why the pizza oven hasn't burnt off all the hair on his arms yet. Other go to orders are the clams and spaghetti cartoccio. The pasta, served in a giant aluminum foil pack erupts a cloud of seafoody steam when opened. If that's not what dreams are made of... Wait, I take that back. That's what MY dreams are made of. I'll usually get a bottle of proseco as well, if I'm in a celebratory mood. Prices are not gentle, but not extravagantly placed either. Don't expect to be served limoncello even if you spend a bomb though; the owner only reserves it for his friends.",jfJF7wNEYW53_h1mE21ztg
Al Forno,al-forno-singapore-2,"For authentic Italian food in the East, look no further than Al Forno's. When I was studying overseas, pasta was our instant noodles and so I'd never think of eating pasta at a restaurant knowing how easy it is to cook it. Yet, whenever I think of Al Forno, my mind immediately conjures up tasty memories of their seafood pasta and I almost start salivating. I don't like seafood, so I usually have just the spaghetti and sauce but the fragrant tomato-based seafood sauce is so good that we usually try to waste as little of the sauce as possible. There isn't a single portion for the seafood pasta, so you would probably have to share it if you order it. We often get it delivered especially if there are many people around. An average meal costs about $25 - $30 per person, but the food tastes deliciously home-cooked almost like it was by an 'Italian grandmother'.",5av7ZYxifKl1jPttRSvt7Q
Al Forno,al-forno-singapore-2,This place should be jam packed. Its a hidden italian gem.  Amazing food and to die for desserts! The food is authentic and delicious. Definitely a restaurant you have to go when you're in singapore!,A7Gal-VcD9B4pUaQX2xQOw
Al Forno,al-forno-singapore-2,"Restaurant own by Italian guy which really take care about the provenance of the product. Pizza are Really good and pasta well cook al dente. For the price, I would rather prefer bit more ingredient. But service need to improve. I order a glass of wine that they totally forgot but still charged me.",zXqCvcijJQNeUuyKjGtXpQ
Al Forno,al-forno-singapore-2,"If you stay in the east, you would probably have heard your neighbours raving about Al Forno. Here is where my family would turn to when everyone's too lazy to cook our dinner and we'd like to dig into some seafood and pasta. I've dine in as well as ordered home delivery and either way the food taste just as good. Home delivery is only for the houses in the east from East coast Road to Tanjong Rhu Road. What's good here and will always be ordered at every table or at least every order in my house is Spaghetti Cartoccio. It is a tomato based mixed seafood pasta with the additional touches of flavour with capers and olives. The result is a rich and flavourful sauce and a good amount of seafood. I usually will request for more spaghetti as there will always be too much sauce and ingredients left! With this and a pizza, a dinner for 4 is settled. Do take into consideration the cooking time and order early if you can. Otherwise just head down and enjoy a nice dinner out with friends!",raKY29o3cqaQYcFdR_bZdg

Ricciotti,ricciotti-singapore-3,"It's been a while since I've been here, and boy has the place changed! After a small conversation with our waiter, who was extremely friendly by the way, we found out the place recently had a facelift. Located slightly off the road from The Central at Clarke Quay, this place serves one of the best Al Granchio's I've had! It is creamy, but without being too cheesy, and they're really generous with the amount of crab meat. Their starters aren't very wide, but their mussels with white wine weren't too bad.",g-P058qnhLVXnEZYKBaVug
Ricciotti,ricciotti-singapore-3,"Quite conflicted about this place, some parts of the dishes were good but there were others that were horrible. 1. Grilled chicken breast- Came with some sides, - Mash potatoes - So good! Buttery & rich :) - Salad - ok - Peach color cream was really yummy! - Chicken breast - Unfortunately the main star of the dish was sorely disappointing. It was dry and so tough to eat! Very blend too! If not for the aforementioned sauce, I am not sure how I would have eaten it. 2. Bruschetta & smoked salmon. - This starter dish came after our mains which was weird. - The Bruschetta was cold. It wasn't crispy or toasted :( Overall, despite some small hits we left disappointed with the food and will probably not return again. I read other reviews which suggest that their pizza is not bad but I don't think I could risk being served another disappointing portion of cold bread!",mLNFKajc56CqeZA6WkgREQ
Ricciotti,ricciotti-singapore-3,"Friday is happy hour all day long.They have different deals daily: 50% off second pizza on tue, off pasta on wed, etc.Only had drinks and tried the panini so far.

Ricciotti,ricciotti-singapore-3,"When I'm feeling like a good pizza or pasta (they switch it up every day of the week - 1-for-1s, wine offers, free tea/coffee with dessert), this is the place I go to.Love the location, love the interior, love their products, and for a fine-dining setting (napkins, fine china, silverware), it's usually no more than $20 apiece for a table of two (if you're splitting a pizza with a cooler, or two pastas). Great value for the quality of food (deliciouso, specially their Mushroom Soup, and their desserts are to die for).Service is attentive, waiters even recognised me (for a moment of time I even used to come here every week because I loved it so!). Special mentions to their Ricciotti Salad ($13.50), Tagliatelle el Salmone ($21.50), and the Rustica (pizza, $23.50).",tBoiIg3s8gUtYNeFrYHBLw
Ricciotti,ricciotti-singapore-3,"I like this place. I came here once looking for pasta and decent Italian food and I think this is good pasta. I tried the 3 dishes in one plate, and the gnocchi really surprised me, it was probably my favorite dish but of course you can't have too much gnocchi otherwise your tummy just gets filled up. It's not like a high end Italian restaurant but I thought the food was good. I just have to continue to come back to make sure the food is consistent since I last came. But I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others based on my first experience. And I would recommend the gnocchi. The other 2 dishes was a crab meat pasta and lasagna. All are good but gnocchi stood out to me. We paired it with red wine as well.",PK5NTAjdVY9mPdtwU0Ve3Q
Ricciotti,ricciotti-singapore-3,Nicely located in the Boat quay right next to the river. The food is just average especially the pizza which was a letdown. The spaghetti pomodoro pasta was pretty good. The kitchen is open till 11 which is a plus in case you want some late night food!,R6TPmf9CSSn3ghW2jKr2mg
Ricciotti,ricciotti-singapore-3,Nice place in the city for some pizza and drinks. Good wine collection with a couple of cocktail options..

Ricciotti,ricciotti-singapore-3,"There is no doubt that Ricciotti has the dishes to attract foodies in Singapore.

Ricciotti,ricciotti-singapore-3,I usually go here for a good pizza. My favorite is Margherita Regina (fresh tomatoes with basil). The bruschetta with tomatoes is a good appetizer too.

Ricciotti,ricciotti-singapore-3,"Nice vibe, good, polite service, good food at reasonable prices.Although it's more of a lunch and dinner place, with excellent pizza, pastas and desserts, it's also a good place for a simple brunch. But a bit too simple - they should expand that brunch menu and we'd be back more often.Nice pace, not the typical Singapore atrocious manner of clearing plates the second you've finished the meal and while you're still chewing. Instead it's a relaxing experience. Friendly, unobtrusive and polite staff.",-G1YjYxjDpxOBzFgo36ORA
Ricciotti,ricciotti-singapore-3,"Another of my favourite coffee joints, Ricciotti was recommended by a friend who was working nearby and dropped in daily for her afternoon fix of tea and cakes. I've not had the chance to try any of the mains or pizzas yet, but from the satisfied looks of other diners together with the aroma that arises from their orders, I can more or less be assured that the food is of decent standard. At night, Ricciotti's ambience becomes a tad more cosy and romantic and is quite a common sight to see dating couples enjoying a glass of bubbly or wine and staring into each others eyes.",8aBKh52ePGd3OG8di20wdw
Baja Fresh Mexican Grill,baja-fresh-mexican-grill-singapore-2,"I went during lunch and took the lunch set menu. It is actually a choice of main dish at a lowet price, but your options are limited. I went for the baja burrito which was filled with chicken, tomatoes, onions and guacamole. You get a bag of tortilla chips for free, for which you can grab a salsa (or more) from the free float salsa bar. The flavours were Ok, but for 10$ I would expect a bit more special.",O5c8SgONRdgDdej4A9W1KQ

I got the Baja burrito with no meat, and got it stuffed with veggies. Side note: if you don't like capsicum (bell peppers) like me, you will spend heaps of time removing them!My burrito came pretty quickly, and all orders come with free chips, which you can get your salsa fix at the salsa bar, which allows you to get as much as you want. I wouldn't say their salsa is amazing, but it is hard to get good tomatoes in Singapore, so I can't say I blame them. There are varying spice levels of salsa for your choice, but I got heaps of cilantro and lemon and stuffed my burrito with them both. The burritos here are pretty large so come here hungry or get them to cut it in two so you can share with a not-so-hungry friend. Pay $2.25 extra for a drink.",SBVNVima7JWeA-6TXVvJbw

Baja Fresh Mexican Grill,baja-fresh-mexican-grill-singapore-2,"I am a huge fan of ""fast food Mexican"" in the USA. Chipotle is my favorite, followed by Free bird's. Baja Fresh is certainly a tad lower on the list. They are not super prevalent in Texas and they are a tad pricier than the first two I mentioned. I heard that there was a Baja Fresh in Singapore.  I have been craving Chipotle pretty much since the day we landed in Singapore. We sought out the Baja Fresh and I am so glad we did! I had a chicken bowl and the portion was HUGE. There is a salsa bar to jazz up your food (even though none of it is too spicy) and my very picky children loved the queso. They have very refined queso pallets. They consider themselves experts!The service was fast and the staff was friendly. They also had a deal where if you checked in on FaceBook, you got a free order of cinnamon churros! They staff was so kind to bring two orders (one for each of my children).

Baja Fresh Mexican Grill,baja-fresh-mexican-grill-singapore-2,"I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this place, REALLY.But alas, I left disappointed.I had the ultimo chicken burrito, which wasn't all that bad, but the ingredients definitely didn't taste fresh at all.My wife had the Mahi Mahi taco platter and towards the end of the meal she mentioned how this is the fishiest fish taco she's ever had. I tried a bite to judge for myself and I almost gagged. Wow, that was disgusting. It's either really old fish, or really bad, but it definitely didn't taste like mahi mahi. It was totally disgusting. I was surprised my wife ate her meal and felt really bad for her at the same time.I guess you can't really compare to a US Baja Fresh restaurant, but this doesn't much resemble a Baja Fresh... they are doing the franchise a big disservice if this is how Asia will be introduced to the Baja Fresh brand.This used to be my most favorite chain mexican restaurant in California... now I shudder at the thought of going to it again.Also, the prices are pretty ridiculous. $33 for 2 tacos and a burrito.No wonder the place was more than half empty during dinner time.",hRMpQlJQDObCpNSJ1qd_fA
Baja Fresh Mexican Grill,baja-fresh-mexican-grill-singapore-2,Went here for dinner with a few friends. The place is very lively and upbeat. The food was OK. They serve alcohol and that's a big plus.I'd recommend this place to anyone craving for Mexican food.,tE0F7o8T4Tn5FFf3L_mbRQ

They were quick to attend to us and ask us what else we would like to order, how is our food,  are we enjoying ourselves etc.However, I can't really say the same for the food. The prices are are quite steep despite being a fast-food place and is not justified by the quality of the food. The meat had grits in them. The salsa sauces, guacamole and sour cream were nothing spectacular. The soft shell tacos and burrito tasted quite bready. I did quite enjoy the quesadilla though! However, food overall was a disappointment. For such prices and at such a location, I expected better. Although the food wasn't horrible, it wasn't very good at the same time.

Baja Fresh Mexican Grill,baja-fresh-mexican-grill-singapore-2,"Mexican food is good for my soul! Located inside Hotel Rendezvous, it's unassuming exterior doesn't leave an impression. In fact the first few times I walked passed it without even noticing it was there!It's Mexican fast food but slightly pricier. Expect I pay about $15 per person for a set with drinks. I really love their burritos - I'd have an Ultimo steak burrito if I'm starving as the rice in it gets you pretty full up, or the Baja on a normal hunger scale as its got guacamole, meat and tomatoes but no rice.You can choose between chicken, beef, shrimp, pork or fish options, so there's something for everyone! Every set comes with a serve of nachos, and free flow servings of freshly made salsa and salsa sauces. I always go nuts on the fresh salsa. They promise that everything is fresh, so nothing from a can or freezer is used -which makes a remarkable difference. No reservations here, just walk ins so be prepare to wait if you come after 7pm.

Baja Fresh Mexican Grill,baja-fresh-mexican-grill-singapore-2,"I'm obsessed with Mexican food. I had it at least once a week in California. You can imagine my excitement when I read that there was a Baja Fresh in Singapore. It's no taqueria but for being 9,000 of miles away, it is pretty awesome. There are fancy Mexican restaurants around but they don't serve simple burritos and tacos, and prices are extra steep. I ordered the Mexicana burrito with rice, chicken and beans. That's typically what I order in California. It was the right size and flavor, but the beans were way undercooked. I think they use dried black beans here, which is perfectly fine, but they need to be soaked longer. In the US, tortilla chips tend to be freshly deep fried before they are served. That way, they are warm and crispy. Here, they don't do that, which gives the chips a little bit of a stale flavor. If they would warm up the chips, that would be awesome! The salsas are perfect though, no complaints there! The roasted chile salsa is exactly like how I remember it, and I really appreciate the pickled jalapenos too. All in all, this is a step up from when all we had in Singapore was Taco Bell and fancy Mexican. We need these mid-level fresh ""fast food"" restaurants like Baja Fresh and Chipotle. I'm very thankful to whoever brought Baja Fresh to Singapore, and I'm sure the 25,000 Americans living here probably feel the same way!",-_iULENf28RbqL2k0ja5Xw

Chicken and rice was fresh and hot. Restaurant is tucked away on Arab street across from the Park Royal hotel and hence on a quieter street.

Tabbouleh,tabbouleh-singapore,"We went here while visiting Arab street/Haji Lane one evening and came here because I had such a big craving for Lebanese food. I was expecting to be a little disappointed, but was surprised when it was almost as good as the Lebanese food my family makes. I had a kofta wrap and thought it was delicious - the meat was juicy and flavorful. I had asked for tzatziki on the side instead of hummus, since that's how I usually eat kofta, but was just given yogurt and oil together, without cucumber mixed in. Regardless, it was still a decent side dip and was great with the wrap. My friends shared a cheese manakish, which was decent. I thought it could have had a little more flavor, and prefer thinner dough, but this was still good and reminded me of ones I eat while at home. Overall this is a great place to try if you're looking for Lebanese food!",LK0zfxdI77wuBPh9uP9EBQ
Tabbouleh,tabbouleh-singapore,"Tabbouleh has sooo much potential and from the two times I've eaten here it's because I've craved for their dish, tabbouleh- a fine balance of parsley, bulgar, tomatoes, onions and lemon juice- decent price for a fairly large portion.Their chicken fatteh was OK- while the taste was pretty solid, I just was not expecting everything to be absolutely drenched in the yogurt. Most recently, however, I tried their shish tawouk and was so let down with their portion size. I did get takeaway, so perhaps not indicative of presentation and serving style while dining in, but I received incredibly soggy fries, some smothered in mayo, with a super tiny wrap smushed on top to fit in the otherwise already tiny container. $10 for this was definitely overpriced.The hummus is still always highly regarded, so I will still come back for my tabbouleh desires and try another appetizer when the craving calls.",iDmeUeE0JXOwcRmX0Nwuhw
Tabbouleh,tabbouleh-singapore,"A bit of a letdown for me, unfortunately. This was one of the few places in Arab Street open around 11:30 AM, and since I was hungry already I hastily settled here. It's an open air place, and even though they do have AC units, it didn't feel very cool at all.Service was a bit inattentive, even though it was just my mom and I. I had to walk to the back to get the server's attention to take our orders and get our bill.For starters we ordered hummus with some bread on the side; this turned out pretty decently. The hummus portion was generous and we were able to take it home with us.I ordered a chicken shawarma, and my mom, the beef. Portion-wise it was puny, and I found my chicken a bit dry. Maybe that's why they served it with a heap of french fries. At least the fries were good.I still stand by my tip that the watermelon juice is refreshing. Do order that if you end up here, especially on hot days!",nzIq7_i0C79ToOp-U5e0fA

Tabbouleh,tabbouleh-singapore,"Been here twice and we really like it. Everything tastes good. We prefer Lebanese hummus because it's smooth and creamy.  It's a great value for what you get -- pita comes for free when you order hummus and other appetizer dips so that saves money. I *think* prices are inclusive of GST and service because whenever I get the bill I'm pleasantly surprised.  There aren't so many exotic decorations, and it's fairly simple setting. They stick to good food served fresh: warm dolmas, freshly made pizza-like with lamb, good hummus, etc. You could pay more to get a Middle Eastern ambience with carpets or tiles or fancy decorations, but if you're more interested in getting good solid food with good service at decent prices, this is the place to go.",3uuz_IsaZ-4jIPn-ay1oAg

Tiong Bahru Boneless Hainanese Chicken Rice,tiong-bahru-boneless-hainanese-chicken-rice-singapore-2,"Continuing our Singapore saga of iconic food binging, we stopped by this small no frills restaurant in Chinatown.  Feel free to leave your fancy dresses back in the Raffles or Fullerton since this is a casual dining experience.  Most of the diners here were locals so it was a good sign. Their menu had a few more selections compared to most chicken rice joints, but we sticked with what made them famousLarge size boneless hainan chicken rice was very good indeed. The ""large"" size was equivalent to a reg size in the states, I hate to see what  a ""small"" size plate is. Most of the chickens were deboned but prob 10-20% had some small bones still so westerners beware. The chicken was relatively tender, minimal fats, skin were thin & silky, indicating relatively fresh spring chicken.  Most cuts they served were good meats, other placed might try to sneak in too many undesirable parts into your plate, not here.  Two self-serving dipping sauce available: the ginger sauce & the spicy sauce.  There was also a bottle of sweet thick dark soy sauce that was good.  Personally I still prefer the Cantonese style of dipping sauce for chicken: its generally more fresh, has more ginger & scallion, slightly more salty & sesame oil. The rice here was excellent: juicy, aromatic & had great flavor derived from the chicken itself, a great compliment to the chicken.Overall this place serves very good local style Hainan chicken rice, it might be a semi-tourist trap but it was able to maintain high standards at locals' price. Would def be back next trip.",CMOZ8rx9ZUOt2L5sv5cGlg

While the quality was good, I think the squid could have used more time absorbing the flavors, instead of getting much of the flavor from the generous amount of sauce.Bottom line: I didn't think the food was all too compelling to want to return to, yet if you seek authentic Indonesian food, and particularly if you're with others eager to share multiple dishes, this will satisfy you.",nT-sNbcZDDo_9cWBPQSMQA

Cumi Bali,cumi-bali-singapore,"Food quality is good -- but value for money, think again. This small restaurant has some how convinced itself that it can sell a small piece of BBQ'd squid for $28? Seriously? Squid dishes abound in this neighborhood near Chinatown, at 1/3 to 1/2 the price. Forget ambiance in the small, cramped and dirty downstairs dining area. It is cluttered cute, but nothing more. All I can say is that you really have to love Indonesian food to pay these kind of prices in this level of restaurant. Because there are dozens of classier, cleaner palaces with equally good or better (but not indonesian) food within a few blocks.

I had ro order another bowl of rice just for the sauce that was left over. I would have even lick the bowl if I wasn't at the restaurant. The satay was amazing and I could eat it all day, slightly different from street one. As it tasted like sweet char sui but with hint of spices. The meat was very juicy and so succulent. One skewer can shared for 2 people but I would say order one each as I didn't want to share because it was that good! Finally the beef rendang was amazing this was melt in your mouth tasty. The sauce was perfect with the right amout of spices and it doesn't  have a runny  sauce (the authentic way)! All in all I would give the food 5 stars, the reason for 4 stars was because it says it is open at 11:30am. We went there at 11:34am the staff says they are not open until 15 mins time.

Cumi Bali,cumi-bali-singapore,"Ok. I'll just come out and say it....the owner (I believe) doubled all of our main dish orders. We ordered the fried rice, beef rendang, and sate madura. She made the assumption without asking us to give us (2) orders of Sate, (2) orders of fried rice and the rendang was higher than the menu suggested. The price as $12 - 22?? I should've ask but I trusted her to give us (1) portion for each order. So she charged us $18 bucks for the rendang and it looked like a regular portion. Our bill was $64.35 for (3) dishes that was suppose to be light lunch for us. The overall flavor was just so so and the quality not too good. Oh....the rendang was tough and some parts inedible. Avoid this place! The ambiance also is not cool, small, old, and nothing good. I guess the worst part is that I was taken advantage of on my vacation.

Cumi Bali,cumi-bali-singapore,"great for big groups as the portions are really huge and best for sharing. Don't be deceived by the limited seating downstairs, the upstairs seating area is huge and true to style, they have several tok panjang (long tables) that can sit up to 20 or more. It is not halal though and even though it says ""Bali"" it is not Balinese food but more Nasi Padang style. In the day time they have assorted dishes displayed for you to choose from, nasi Padang style. So eating alone is no problem but night time, the solo diners will be more limited in choice. apart from the grilled squid, my favourites will definitely be the sate ayam (chicken satay) which is draped in delicious dark sauce and the portions are huge. One stick is enough for one person's main course. Another specialty is their Ikan bakar (grilled fish) which is more like a fish wrapped with otah. the portions are huge and meant for more than 2. haven't really tried anything unsatisfactory here before but the wait can be long at times especially when crowded.",j8UlPZDO6K5iI8T7LKPqEA

Your buzzer will ring when your food is ready. You can go back to the cashier area to pick up your dish! Just a note, the meats get grilled on the spot so they take longer to be ready. My vegetarian choice was prepared within 5 minutes and some people who ordered meat did not get their food even after I was done eating! I was also told that the Lawn is one of the shops that closes late in biopolis (beyond 7pm).I enjoyed the pesto sauce. The egg is hardboiled and rather boring. Cashews are great way to add a healthy crunch to your salad. Couscous is tasty and fluffy. Asparagus was so thin I forgot it was there!!

It was difficult to drink with the spoon. It tasted quite rich and creamy.For the main course, we got to choose between Teriyaki Chicken and Butter Seared Pacific Dory with Parsley Rub, which I selected Butter Seared Pacific Dory with Parsley Rub. It was served with Olive Rice, Side Salad and Wafu dressing. Although the Olive Rice was flavourful, I felt that it was too salty on its own. The fish on the other hand was quite bland.Lastly for dessert, we were served swiss roll. Not sure if the staffs were rushing to knocking off, as the food was served in paper plates. We did take note that it was past the usual operating hours. By this time, there was barely any air-condition in the room. The swiss roll was quite dry.Overall the food was not to my taste.

The Lawn Salad & Grill Cafe,the-lawn-salad-and-grill-cafe-singapore,"If you have the perception that eating a salad for lunch means that the meal's not gonna fill you up, I'm going to share two things:1. You're not alone2. Visit The Lawn to be proven wrongI've had many a salad in my lifetime of weak attempts to lose weight, and I'm going to declare that the salad I had the other day at The Lawn definitely makes it into the Top 3 Best Salads I've had in Singapore. And at an affordable price to boot. ($9.90). The tricky part is you've got to get the right mix. You get:- A choice of 1 Grill (ranging from chicken breasts, types of fish, prawns, duck, beef, even mushrooms or asparagus for vegetarians)- 5 Toppings (a whole stretch of toppings laid out on the table, such as corn, roasted potatoes, pasta, cucumber, tomatoes, walnuts, apples, CHEESE etc)- A Dressing (honeyball, perky sesame ginger, maple peanut, citrus, ma sa spicy, and others which I shall not elaborate further because it doesn't matter until you taste it anyways) EVERYTHING IS UP TO FATE - I kid, you can try your best to create the same combination every time once you've perfected it. (I think it'd be great for the shop to recommend the best combinations after doing some experimental tasting sessions themselves, so people won't have to wreck their brains over it hah!)I must be lucky because I got a great combi on my first try - Char-grilled prawns on a veggie base, dressing was perky sesame ginger, and the 5 toppings I can't really recall except there were pineapples (worked amazingly well with the prawns), egg, corn, cucumber... oh and pasta. The perky sesame ginger dressing was delectable - it keeps you going, very yummeh. My friend, who ordered a dory salad with honeyball dressing, wasn't so lucky because I found her dressing too sour for my liking - and it was strange because a name like honeyball would make you expect it to be sweeter than most. So yeah, one tip - the dressing choice is significant.Can someone go and try the rest of the dressings and let me know how it goes? :DIt was a sumptuous experience in the mouth. Nom noms juicy prawns and nom noms fresh greens. I noticed they sold cute tubs of Tiramisu - The Tiramisu Hero; it was $7, a little tad expensive but we were in the mood for desserts. Mmm, the packaging was adorable, but I've tried better Tiramisu elsewhere. Nonetheless, this would make perfect festive gifts to co-workers! Employee of the month, here I come.The environment and setting was very good to chill at, not sure how it's like during lunch hours though. Some part of me feels that it might get a little crowded because most of their ingredients sell out fast. The only complaint I have is that people not working in the vicinity would have to make a tiny climb to get to the location. If you've heard me whine while I was finding my way under the hot sun, you'd think the sun crash-landed into Buona Vista.Thankfully, The Lawn serves free-flow plain water. There are other drink options of course, but if you're a strict ""salad-health-yoga-cleansemybody&soul"" type of person, you'd know you're at the right place.Check out eatlikeawhale.blogspot.sg for more pictures and reviews.",1wWXchH7yRlFCxfC4dkQnA
The Lawn Salad & Grill Cafe,the-lawn-salad-and-grill-cafe-singapore,"Nested in a quiet corner of Biopolis' building Nanos The Lawn is a great find (within 10mins walking distance of Buona Vista mrt). My the time my friend and I got there (about 1.45pm on a weekday) and we were told that there was only the chicken & prawn grills left (that's how popular they are with the office crowd!!!). I'll make sure to beat the lunch crowd in future so that I can sample their fish options :) Despite that, they did manage to whip together a wicked meal and impressed us both. We did thoroughly enjoy our meal & The Lawn left us thinking... ""Salad Stop who???""... It was healthy yet ridiculous tasty! I would happily go on a diet if I could eat there everyday. My only sin was the peach beer ($8)! But I regret nothing. It tasted great and was the perfect compliment to my salad. They carry a modest selection of premium beers (akin to The Good Beer Company). We had the chance to chat with one of the co-owners, Sarah, and she explained they got the inspiration for The Lawn from Palo Alto's very own Pluto's (which is very popular on University Ave). Similar to Pluto's concept, you get to ""build your own salad"" - choose 5 toppings & 1 meat. Unlike most other salad joints, The Lawn grills your meat on the spot so you get it pippin' hot & fresh. I had the chance to try Pluto when I was living in the Bay Area so I can fairly compare the both and say that I prefer The Lawn :) The Food ($9.90)1. Grilled Chicken breast with Maple infusion (One of the most popular items) - I LOVE THIS!!! When I think of chicken breast (especially those placed in Salads) my brain is automatically conditioned to think of dry/cold meat because this is how most places prepare it. However, The Lawn's chicken breast was ever so tender and savory! Very well marinated, I must say. It has an addictive subtle tinge of honey flavor to it (akin to Honey chicken). The serving portion was very generous too! Good for guys (Even the big boys). - The rest of the salad was pretty standard - mixed greens. - The toppings I chose - corn, eggs, grapes, tomatoes, bread crumbs (I think they were cheese laced bread crumbs). 2. Char-grilled Garlic Prawns- My friend order this & she loved it too! I had a little taste of 1 or 2 prawns and it was good. Well marinated and fresh. The Secret Sauces - This is what really MADE the Salad (aside from the delicious hot grilled meat). 1. Red Island - My favorite!!! - Not sure what's inside but it's heavenly. This sauce was a creamy orange/peach color. Savory yet it has a slightly sweet aftertaste. I am hooked! I wish I could buy a bottle of this sauce and dip all my food in it. 2. Honeyball- If you are a fan of sweet dips this one is for you! It's thick & brown. Think of a sweeter version of the traditional BBQ sauce?3. Perky Sesame Ginger - My favorite #3 - This one gave my chicken an oriental flavor! Yums! It looks like a light brown liquid sauce.  4. Maple Peanut- Peanut lovers, you'll jump for joy at this one. It's a well made sauce but I prefer my peanuts in my PB&J sandwiches.  5. Me So Spicy - My favorite #2 (almost on par with #1)- It's the twin of Red Island (*a smilar appearance - a creamy orange/peach color) except a little spicy. Not too spicy though (my spicy tolerance level is 2/5, and it was ok for me). 6. Citrus - This one is a light blend of citrus & olive oil (I believe). It has a green/olive appearance but not much of a taste (in my opinion). It was such fun trying all the sauces!!! @Sarah - Thanks for allowing us to do that :) But honestly, even without the sauces my grilled chicken was awesome! With the sauces, you'll get to switch up the flavors (x2 awesomeness)! The Desserts- I didn't get to try any because I was too stuffed from lunch (as I mentioned serving size is very generous!!! Don't be fooled to think that this salad is a mere humble starter) but on my way out I saw that they offered tiramisu in a jar! How cute is that? Definitely will go back to try it another time. The Service - Fast & efficient.The Ambiance - A clean concept of carpet grass and picnic like checked tablecloths. It makes you feel like you are on a picnic with friends. They have fluffy cushion pillows on some tables too. Great for a lazy weekend afternoon! Overall: Great experience. Exceed all my expectations (initially I was thinking it was just another Salad Stop clone but how wrong I was... This is much better! The sauces and the grill won me over & puts it at the top of my list for Singapore's Best Salad Joints. I only wish that they will have more outlets :)",mLNFKajc56CqeZA6WkgREQ

The Lawn Salad & Grill Cafe,the-lawn-salad-and-grill-cafe-singapore,"As a frequent tourist to Singapore, I really enjoy the local fare. But sometimes you just need a good salad.  Coming from a country where vegies are fresh and readily available it's always been a struggle to find the equivalent in Singapore.When I first discovered The Lawn, I was wary about their offerings as I had been disappointed by other so called  salad joints in Singapore. Food:I am glad to say that the Lawn satisfied my salad cravings. The bowl comes pre-mixed with a good portion and selection of mesclun vegies. There's a sizeable range of healthy additions such as chestnuts, tofu, alfalfa sprouts, amongst others. However the best part is the grilled proteins available, my favourites are the garlic marinated prawns and the marinated dory fish. But the duck breast and Ben's beef rub also come highly recommended. Value:Salad bowls with 5 toppings, one grilled protein and dressing  (which are all homemade and delicious) is priced reasonably. Some might consider it overpriced but I believe that the amount of fresh vegies and grilled meat you receive per serve, is definitely value for money!Ambience:Taking 'the lawn' concept into consideration I found that owners did a fantastic job in creating a witty and idyllic picnic style environment complete with astroturf comfortable cushions!Other highlights:-There's always great music playing through the store- They serve a pretty decent coffee ( at the Shenton Way outlet) and dessert selection (both outlets) for those like to indulge a littleAll in all, I highly recommend visiting The Lawn either at Biopolis or the Tanjong Pagar outlet.",zE7l0BgB_Ew1fXmbLCD7XA
The Lawn Salad & Grill Cafe,the-lawn-salad-and-grill-cafe-singapore,"The lawn is a good place, only if you are not looking for a good fresh typical salad. Otherwise, you might be disappointed by the variety of greens they offer. Unlike other typical salad bars, they have a premixed bowl of greens which you can add toppings and meats to. The dory fish is pretty tasty, but the prawns tend to be a tad too salty. The beef cubes have good flavor, but definitely on the well done side. It's good for once a month (only if you are in the vicinity), otherwise it's real easy to get sick of. I wish they will offer some other selections of greens like an arugula salad or a caesar salad. Their pumpkin soup (if they have it) and the bread roll are worth a try though.An update: One of the owners apparently does not take constructive criticism very well, so for that, it gets a drop in star rating from 3 to 2.",Ruh7DvkWtO_oXqyrCYbXig

Then you pick your toppings which include eggs, nuts and corn etc before dressing it up with a choice of eight sauces.",blxzOOhWwU_VtgVYxwL0AA
The Lawn Salad & Grill Cafe,the-lawn-salad-and-grill-cafe-singapore,"Note: i wrote this review in March 13 on a different website. When a friend mentioned that a new salad shop had opened in the West, I was excited. Unfortunately, my excitement quickly turned into dismay. My pet peeve when it comes to salad cafes/restaurants are places that market themselves as ""healthy"" when their salads are anything but. I ordered the char grilled garlic prawns (which I note, come highly recommended here). Mine were served extremely salty and oily. And by that I mean that the morning after my dinner, I was STILL extremely thirsty, and this was despite eating less than half of the prawns which were served. This was a pity as the prawns were juicy and of a nice size. I think there was simply just TOO MUCH marinade on the prawns. My entire salad was oily and salty, so I couldn't eat much of the vegetables either. Perhaps one way to solve this is to have the meats unmarinated and only seasoned when placed on the grill. The option of less oil would also be welcome. After having my salad, I was extremely thirsty and remained so the next day. I would have also preferred if more green vegetable toppings were available. Perhaps I'm a purist. When I have my salads, I want to be assured that I'm truly having a healthy meal. I think this was anything but. If you value well seasoned meats over your greens, perhaps this place might be for you.",4Imxj8nYyM2Vw56l2y1noQ
The Lawn Salad & Grill Cafe,the-lawn-salad-and-grill-cafe-singapore,"Let me get this straight. I USED to love The lawn. I mean, it after all introduced me to the yummy world of salads. The lawn used to be 1. Cheaper2. Fresher3. Bigger portionsBut somehow, after they became popular, the quality of their food just kept going downhill and downhill and so does the service. Every time I go in with excitement, I exit the restaurant with disappointment.  Today I ordered a black pepper duck salad with 5 toppings. Let me say the good stuff first, the duck is still delicious. All of the 2 stars I am giving to this place is for the duck. OK, that's that with the good things, let me move on to the bad. First off, there were ""water marks"" on their greens (which actually means the veggies were starting to rot!), a salad is supposed to be fresh, this is quite unacceptable. And then, there were just a total of maybe 15 pieces of lettuces. I mean seriously, you call yourself a salad place, and all you have in the bowl of greens are lettuces, what happen to other salad greens? It used to have so much more variety of greens than now. I can't help but feel cheated. Finally, the dressing, I asked for dressing on the side, and it came as small spoonful in the small container. I was shocked at how little dressing I was given, that even after I poured everything into my bowl, the salad still didn't taste like anything. I can go on and on, but I wouldn't. Let's just hope that you guys will do something about the quality of your food because it used to be good, and I want it to be good again.",60S1f9efCHbSp4AxJJnsrA
Maki-San,maki-san-singapore-3,"It's official- I have a Maki-San addiction! (Or if I'm in denial... I am fully committed to Maki-San!)I have yet to visit the original outlet in Dhoby Ghaut, but their third outlet it Katong suits me just fine. They loosely refer to themselves as ""the Subway of sushi"", and it's a totally fitting description. Sushi snobs, this place isn't for you.The fun part about this place is you get to choose what goes in your roll! There are so many ingredients to choose from, some traditionally Japanese, others, truly local (bak kwa or smoked duck, anyone?) I have yet to try their salads, as I have way too much fun playing around with all the sushi combos I can make!If for some reason I go missing in Singapore, please visit Maki-San first. I'll most likely be chomping down on a tempura-filled mega-san roll.",nzIq7_i0C79ToOp-U5e0fA
Maki-San,maki-san-singapore-3,"Finally .... yes, I finally tried Maki San after (1) seeing other Yelper/s posts on Maki San (2) passing by the outlet at i12 many many times, but always promising myself I'll try it another time lol (3) receiving the mail-dropped flyer from maki-san informing us that they now deliver Island-wide. I'll make this short as many other reviewers have already reviewed it. I love it that I'm able to choose what goes into my sushi - it's really FUN!! The sushi came in a very nice lovely box that I was so tempted to bring it home with me #vanisahoarder I didn't bring it back after all. #butiwasverytemptedtoMy sushi was really yummy! The whole dining experience was ok. The design of the eatery was functional with some cute wacky wall posters depicting Crazy & funny Sushi art! I guess people are here for the food - nutritious, delicious sushi and not so much for the comfort.

Maki-San,maki-san-singapore-3,"Maki-San has arrived in Katong. Yes!  Customizable sushi at a colourful, fun loving store manned by friendly and smiling staff.  By the way, since this is customizable sushi, if you order the wrong thing, you have no one to blame but yourself! :D Ordering is a little daunting at first, but once you get it, it's simple enough. Just pick up the red pen and paper (order menu) and tick away. If you need help, there is at least one staff manning the order booth -- don't be shy. Available Sizes: Little San or Mega San --- Choose the Mega-San, you'll thank me laterWrap: Traditional Nori (Seaweed); Crepe (Egg Wrap); --- I'm a traditionalist, Seaweed all the way. Essentials/toppings (3 choices for Little San and 5 for Megan San): Ebiko (Prawn Roe), Kani Stick (Crab Stick), Roasted Mushroom, Steamed Ebi (Prawn), Tamagoyaki (Japanese Omelette),  Tempura Enoki Mushroom -- These ingredients are all great.Sprinkles: Tempura Crunch -- if you want your sushi crunchy and Japanese tasting, choose this!House Sauces: This is the most important selection of the lot. One false move, and you won't like what you've ordered. I've been to this store twice now and the Chilli Crab has never failed me. Kind of gives the sushi that oh so Beautiful Singapore taste. Specials: Salmon Sashimi -- This afterall is a pseudo Sushi restaurant, so Sashimi Salmon all the way. You can come to Maki-San over and over again and you will never tire of it because of the huge selection of ingredients. It is a Sushi Place, but when it is all said and done, you'll never feel like you ate sushi, but rather a food concoction of your own imagination. The store is cute, albeit on the small side. The packaging is jaw-droppingly beautiful -- as a business person, I wonder what the margins on this business are with this huge fixed cost. I almost feel bad, leaving the box after my meal. In all, just a truly wonderful concept. If I had any constructive criticism, it's that the meal is not very filling (even with the Mega-San).  I guess that is a testament at how good this place is. Fortunately, its only SGD9.90 an order, so if your complaining like me, do your self a favor and just order another one. :-)",anrZv1OM1a2sC_EfZ8mt-Q
Maki-San,maki-san-singapore-3,"Thanks to Michelle! I have another Japanese cafe to go to. I only knew about this cafe when I saw the check ins and reviews from a few Yelpers in my list and that caught my attention. Finally, my first visit of that place came and I was looking so forward to trying the sushi. I was not disappointed at all! The quality of the seaweed and rice is very good, and the best thing? I get to choose my own ingredients! There are more than 30 ingredients for you to choose from, even the famous Chinese ""Bwa Kwa"" (BBQ pork) is available. I picked a few of my choices and then the nice staff cut the whole row of sushi into smaller ones. The sushi is then presented into a very pretty box which I kept it as a momento. Took my first bite of it and I was in heaven (literally of course), it's pretty good as its fresh and has good favour among the ingredients. Combining them together, I got myself a good sushi roll. I will definitely return for more. The cafe isn't big so don't be surprised if the place is filled during peak hours but trust me it's worth it especially if you are a Sushi lover. :)",Vtdm-QpN5yYxT-O00cuqFg

Wrap & Roll,wrap-and-roll-singapore,"We went here for lunch.  Their menu is mostly focused on rolls and a couple of noodle dishes, so their menu is very appetizer heavy. We had this huge egg-pan-fried roll that was very filling ($15), and our own noodle dishes. (The standard rice noodle with meat and fish sauce.)  So we ended up paying $25 each, which is a little pricey for Vietnamese food. I'm not sure why Vietnamese food is so expensive in Singapore, when it's rice noodles which is like $3 in a hawker stall. Hence the minus 1 star.",3uuz_IsaZ-4jIPn-ay1oAg

Wrap & Roll,wrap-and-roll-singapore,"The sign outside the restaurant got my attention: Epicurean Star Award, Singapore 2015, Winner.  I went in, and order the Fried Fish Noodle Soup.  There was a note of ""Lower Calories"".  When it came, I knew why.  It was the stingiest bowl of noodles I've ever been served, at SGD13.95 or SGD$16.36 (10% service and 7% Tax)!  Half a cup of rice vermicelli, two pieces each of fried fish, fish balls, fish cake and one red chili stuffed with fish paste.  All small, dried up and hard.  The soup broth was gray looking and the tablespoon of beansprouts, three leaf sprig of basil, two thin wedges of tomato, and two pieces of green onion didn't spruce up the look.  The taste although not awful was unimpressive with the high price tag.  The service was pleasant and the cashier took my feedback with a smile.  I hope that they get the 10% service charge.  Maybe not, because there was also a tip jar.  I was told that people liked the rolls.  My view is that if you can't get any dish right, it should be off the menu.  This one definitely should be dumped. Although its ""buyer beware"" in any purchase, my experience of Vietnamese pho has been that its sumptuous, colorful and delicious.  This experience was a  sad, grey, stingy and expensive one.",GfgUbo10R7cWvXq4QPoemA

Mondo Mio Singapore,mondo-mio-singapore-singapore,"Ughhh I am so conflicted writing this review. To be honest, everything BUT the food was good when we ate there this past weekend. We really liked the ambience, the service, and the crowd dining there, but the food was unfortunately underwhelming. The prices for wine by the glass are very reasonable. My prosecco cost less than $10 and you know how many places you have pay more than $12 for beer? I had the fettuccine with bacon and sundried tomato, my fiancé had this fusilli with pesto sauce and salmon. My sauce was way too salty and it was overall a very confusing flavor. My fiancé's dish came with maybe five measly small bites of salmon. The taste wasn't that much better than the presentation. If you just want to get couple glasses of wine and grab some light fare, maybe give it a shot. But don't expect too much of the food.",VmGZJs1EgiRqWXGbhMB1GA
Mondo Mio Singapore,mondo-mio-singapore-singapore,"Hate to do this but our meal at Mondo Mia was rather perfunctory. It's a rather drab looking joint but I'm willing to over look that since the likes of Da Luca have seen better days too. It strikes me as a neighborhood joint where you can pick up a pizza/pasta to go or dine in with a book if you felt like it. We sat facing the kitchen and there were no Italians in sight, which may or may not have been a warning bell because we've eaten at Indian-run Italian joints and they turn out decent pizzas. If you're a stickler for Italian-ness, there was some smarmy Italian music playing so there you go. We popped in here for a pre-theatre meal on Saturday.After we were shown to our table, we sat down and the waiter laid our table and placed a bottle of olive oil in the center. We expected some bread to appear since other tables had some but I guess our table fell though the cracks. We started our meal with one of the day's specials - burratina  with parma ham, salami and rocket leaves. This was the highlight of our meal as  the cheese was fresh (though a little sloppy even for a home made one) and went very well with the salty cold cuts and bitter leaves. My only gripe is that it cost more than our mains, but not a big deal. For mains, I had a crabmeat spaghetti with vodka sauce while the dude had an aglio olio. Both dishes were terribly bland, which is not something you'd expect with a vodka sauce or pasta tossed in spices. The aglio olio looked strikingly similar to a vongole as it had *some* garlic, no peperoncino or parsley, let alone some pecorino to top it off. You can imagine how much fun that was to consume.We paid about $70 for these 3 dishes and no wine, so I would definitely say that I've had better.",2zbO5Cpuu0svXn3br0T84Q

Mondo Mio Singapore,mondo-mio-singapore-singapore,"Went to Mondo Mio for the second time today because I believe in second chances and although the food was great, the staff and service were terrible. The first time we came after lunch they were one hr from closing and they were NOT happy to serve us but we decided to stay anyways, I am not a terrible person so we ordered quickly and ate super fast but they kept giving us mean looks and they practically took the plate away while I had food on my fork! I felt super rushed and we left within 45 mins. Today I went for dinner, was not greeted well and they CLEARLY stated they have pasta and pizza specials which is buy one and get one. I asked the waitress and she confirmed it and showed me on the menu, another waiter a male came and I confirmed again and we ordered pastas and drinks. They ignored us the rest of the time and when the bill came it was for the full amount with no special, I tried to call the waiter and he ignored me 3 times, finally he came and I showed him the bill he took it from my hand, did not let me finish my sentence and went to correct it which tells me he knew it was wrong the entire time. He was rude and I will certainly not go back.",wQzLhjrEzfepf2BCCtk7fA
Mondo Mio Singapore,mondo-mio-singapore-singapore,"Serving up not only authentic italian dishes, the dining experience is made to be as close to the real deal; served complimentary prosecco and little bites with an Italian service crew recommending dishes to you, I thoroughly enjoyed the meal there, besides the fact that I was stuffed by the end of the it. I taste the mondo mio signature pasta,and though I felt it was too pricey, when I did dig into it, the price seems rather fair.Here what is great is how there are no hard and fast rules. We had also asked for a second pasta, however one that was off the menu as recommended by our server. We were more than happy to taste something according to what we had liked since the server asked us what we were the flavours we usually prefer. The pizzas were thinly crusted, well made, but given a few other italian restaurants that I've tried, the pizza didn't stand out that much.If you are undecided and strolling along Robertson Quay, this is one restaurant you can count on for decent food!",raKY29o3cqaQYcFdR_bZdg

Or visit a hot pot restaurant and ended up at the birthplace of your forefathers? Similar experience here; only two tables of us natives and the rest a hodge podge of globalisation. We ordered up the lamb shank, sausages and a bottle of Odd Socks Shiraz-Cab-Merlot to share. Food was one dimensional and bland overall, and the lamb while tender, had barely any flavour to it. The sausage had tiny bits of apple, and the bubble and squeak that came with it had an interesting textureIf you're sitting inside, seating leaves much to be desired as tables are situated uncomfortably close to each other. It's a challenge to inhale deeply before squeezing past the neighbouring table, and you're always faced with the dilemma of whether to have your ass or crotch possibly brush against your neighbour's arm. Decisions, decisions. Product knowledge seems a little off. The lady on my left ordered a glass of red, the exact same blend as us. However, the waitstaff referred to it as Old Socks rather than Odd Socks, in that ""Ma'am did you order a glass of Old Socks?"" and ""Excuse me, here's your Old Socks."" How do I know this? Blame it on the close proximity of the tables. The table on my right had a bit of a sticky situation when the couple's mains arrived before their side of wedges. The guy went ahead to devour his steak, which looked more like a skinny sirloin than 120 day grain fed rib eye, and the lady just didn't want to touch her chow till the spuds arrived. They arrived after having had to check with the waitstaff twice, by which time the dude was more than half done with his steak. How do I know this?

Rabbit Carrot Gun,rabbit-carrot-gun-singapore-2,"Came on a quiet late Saturday morning as me and wife had often passed this charmingly laid out cafe in our weekend explorations of the Katong/Joo Chiat neighborhood. Sadly, the experience was disappointing. Despite a half empty cafe, food was served almost 30 minutes after coffee and juice arrived. The chalkboard advertised pork pie was minuscule and burnt -- the bottom crust was blackened and my knife couldn't cut through. The eggs Benedict was so-so, which didn't make the wait worthwhile. When I sent back the pork pie, the wait staff didn't seem surprised. As no one from the kitchen came to apologize, I decided not to accept a replacement and canceled the item.

Rabbit Carrot Gun,rabbit-carrot-gun-singapore-2,"This café is nestled under a beautifully restored shop house, at the corner of East Coast Road, where the famous 49 Tanjong Katong Laksa used to be. Rabbit's unique name is actually inspired by our popular childhood game 'Rock, Paper, Scissors'!This café is set up by Richard Huggins, former regional sales director of Microsoft Advertising and English chef Jane Glascow of The Pantry at Loewen Gardens. I highly recommend you to drive here as this place is quite inaccessible. Parking lots are available along Ceylon Road or Marshall Road. Forget about taking the MRT! The 'nearest' MRT Station (Dakota or Paya Lebar) would take you 25 minutes to walk!The entire place is very hip and informal. The interior is filled with black and white photographs and retro-looking artworks. Coupled by the antique furniture collection and 'traditional' floor tiles, it certainly felt quite homely.I visited this café on a weekday afternoon and the place was very quiet and empty. What I disliked the most was the lack of air-conditioning. Since the café is open to the street, it's quite hot and humid, especially in the afternoon. I felt that the seats were arranged too closely to each other, which made me feel uncomfortable.I later found out that their only business isn't just a café - they also have beautifully re-furbished suites for travellers to stay in. Directly above the cafe lies the Rabbit Retreat - three luxuriously furnished rooms for travellers to explore a different side of Singapore.I find the food here very expensive. Appetizers can go up to $16.50! Besides, food takes forever to come. There were a total of 4 customers (including us) but it took almost 20 minutes for our pastas to arrive.My friend had their Prawn Aglio Olio ($16.90). Pasta and spinach tasted pretty good - it's chewy and not too salty. Also, prawns tasted very fresh.I went for the Beetroot Pasta ($16.90). It tasted sweet and goes really well with the lump of yogurt! The only drawback is that the portion is slightly small and to pay such a high price for it, not value for money!I would say Rabbit Carrot Gun is a decent place for catching up with friends over a good meal and for people watching. Service was pretty good. All of them were quite friendly and helpful. However, the high prices will surely deter me from coming back anytime soon!",MDfMrY7UYgXDylMSmpgVGA

Rabbit Carrot Gun,rabbit-carrot-gun-singapore-2,"A quaint place in the middle of Katong, its quirky name was the first thing that inspired my friend and I to give it a try. The food was slightly underwhelming, with the exception of its crisp fries. The fries were definitely a huge plus. We tried the Eggs Benedict and the Gourmet Beef Burger. For lack of a better description, both were distinctly average. The eggs were done alright but could have been fluffier.

Rabbit Carrot Gun,rabbit-carrot-gun-singapore-2,"Pretty quiet for a Sunday evening dinner much different from a Saturday lunch crowd that we saw.  By quiet I mean really quiet like 20 percent capacity.  Certainly no need for a reservation and I wonder why.  We sort of had cold feet on whether we should even bother going in and tempted do a burger two doors down but braved it anyway.  The food finally came...ordered the salmon, steak and the sausages.  Food was pretty good actually.  For starters they did not over cook the salmon.  The apple sausages were nice with just enough fat and pork.  The mash that came with the salmon and sausage was light and smooth.  They got a medium rare steak right too.  Only issue is on a value for money they get a 2 out of 5.  Certainly a salmon with mash and local naibi will not cost you $28 and another 10 bucks that be at fine dinning level main course.  That is a high profit margin there.  Ambience wise it was a little dimly lit and the Airconditioning has no effect.  I suppose if you want more customers they should brighten the place up perhaps able to attract more customers.  Overall service was not too bad just perhaps things are a little slower so they tend to be slower?  Has the apple crumple and toffe pudding.  Not bad but wish they got more ice cream.  Unfortunately the toffee pudding could not beat the one at pinique at taka.",yNraV5fC6-0m-kgF5P7hqA

My typical disappointment-proof dishes to order and share is the sambal kangkong (enough to share among 4 people), tahu telor and the fried fish (deliciously fresh!)The only letdown is that they don't serve sweet & sour fish anymore, that used to be my favourite dish growing up! Perhaps it wasn't very Indonesian, they realized? I don't know.Final verdict: Good old reliable restaurant for a satisfying Indonesian feast.",kWpV8BiFGNRhpeHYXl_q6g

Yeo Keng Nam Chicken Rice,yeo-keng-nam-chicken-rice-singapore,"I didn't do this establishment justice by merely posting a few hurried photos(without comments) of their chicken on the rack and by simply checking in. This place has always been a family favourite for years (since the 80's) and it's never failed us yet. The ""auntie"" who makes the chicken and the rice and the amazing soup is still there governing the place. Her chicken rice is fragrant, fluffy and cooked with just the right amount of gasp... chicken fat and 1 bowl of rice is never quite sufficient. The other thing that I come here for, is, the free flow of soup. Yes the soup might be a little too salty, & yes... its also, maybe a little too peppery... BUT it is unbelievably addictive. I have seen people do takeaways with their own carriers (mind you, they are large carriers) for the soup. and oh yes, of course, the chicken is tender, juicy and faultless to say the least.Hands down... this is the best chicken rice in Singapore, in my opinion. Its just too bad that I don't live in the north anymore. And this place isn't quite as accessible. But hey... Singapore's really tiny so what's an extra 15mins on the road.",TOZI_-UpMf3Iz0_LIKEMaA

The whole car is redolent of it that you just want to devour the packet of chicken rice immediately. You are warned. Luckily it dissipates quicker than durian smell. Like what Cheryl N reviewed, the rice is good enough to eat on its own without any dark soy sauce or even chili sauce.

Yeo Keng Nam Chicken Rice,yeo-keng-nam-chicken-rice-singapore,"The most memorable chicken rice that i've tasted was dabao-ed (takeaway) by S. It was the most fragrant and fluffy rice cooked in chicken fat that i've tasted. I immediately proclaimed it to be the best chicken rice in Singapore in between gobbles. According to S, it was a random buy but i thought we hit chicken rice jackpot. It was only when i took a closer look at the stall that i realize this is no ordinary chicken rice stall. They have won some award back in 2009 for their traditional Hainanese dishes.I like the broken and slightly soft rice grains. This shows that they have been simmered in a rich stock of fried ginger, garlic, chicken stock (and some fats) and salted for additional flavor. Some people have complained that this is too healthy. Seriously?? I don't care as long as it tastes good. The fragrance of stock has penetrated and locked itself within each grain of rice and you can simply eat this on its own. No need for chili or dark soy sauce (i thought the dark soy overpowers the flavor of the rice). I actually contemplated having a second bowl of rice! Amazeballs!The chicken is nicely flavored as well. They served us breast meat for the individual plates though. I should have said i want the thigh meat for that additional succulence and tenderness. The breast meat wasn't dry though and was juicy enough.The chili was a killer. It really stings. There is a nice sourness and spiciness to the blend of ginger, garlic and chili. Go easy on it if you can't take chili.",4WlVklOsSd409skDsWwQkQ

This is the 2nd K+B location with the first operating for a few months now at Leisure Park Kallang. The owners hope to open many more and franchise it throughout Asia. The pizza are delicious and because I'm a thin-crust fan, this place already has a ""pizza"" my heart. The crust has a little spring & chewiness to it so if you prefer a harder crust, you may not enjoy it as much. The sauce and topping options are very extensive and fresh, but the bacon is superb. Perfect size slices of real side pork, and not that dried baco-bit stuff many other places use. Pizza comes out pretty quick and is in the oven only a couple of minutes - great for those who are patience challenged.Counter seating, convenient to Raffles Place MRT (Exit C towards Ocean Financial Centre basement level), and friendly service.

Pita Pan,pita-pan-singapore,"Pita Pan is a great place to grab some food before the nightly light show (you get a good view of the light show from the steps of Marina Bay Sands) or if you're shopping at Marina Bay Sands. I had a really delicious falafel wrap meal here. The meal comes with fries and a drink, but it's a bit expensive. (You're paying for the location, I think -- Marina Bay Sands is a little fancy-pants and touristy.) The falafel balls were flavourful and not at all dry (which can happen with falafels), and the hummus was really enjoyable.Atmosphere-wise, this place is pretty casual...kind of one step up from fast food. It's all Mediterranean-style vegetarian food, but not all-vegan (they have a lot of shakshuka options, which have egg.) They also have a range of pizzas, salads, and platters with dips. It was crowded when I was there (at night) and the air conditioning was frigid (not a bad thing if you've been out walking and sightseeing all day.) Service was a little unfriendly, but they were busy.Definitely worth a stop if you're near Marina Bay Sands and craving some Mediterranean food.",iFjKasqkx7shSFsYOgNG2g

We ordered the Mediterranean platter to share among three of us and a Green shaksuka to share. Food took approximately 10mins to be ready. I like it that the food are served warm. The serving was fairly decent for the price. The taste was interesting and delicious. A different taste experience vs the usual Chinese/Korean/Jap cuisine. Not sure if such food would appeal to my parents who mostly prefer Asian food. Overall, decent food with slightly above average price tags.",qqZzCpD70nRd-UilsywRQA
Pita Pan,pita-pan-singapore,"Why am i getting charged for service for food that I order at the cashier then bring back to my table by myself?

It's still decently priced for its location, but i just wish they are more up front about it.The food is good. I love the pita pockets, where you can choose your own (healthy!) ingredients and add your own sauces. Sundried tomato falafel is tasty. The red and green shakshouka are both really yummy as well, served piping hot.I just wish they would solve the odd hidden charges already!!!",WjFI4zVmeDkA7c3tcOy3-g
Pita Pan,pita-pan-singapore,"Had a business meeting around the Marina Bay Sands area thus decided to wander around to check out the food here. Was introduced to Pita Pan by my lunch buddy for the day for it's easy to consume Pita that's served the Subway style.First you go to the counter to order what you'll like to have. Decided to go for the simple and easy to manage Pita Set. Went for the half set which is served with 3 falafel instead of the full set which has 5 falafel. Besides the Pita, the set comes with a drink and an order of fries. For those who are here for the first time, I recommend that you top up the set with an additional $2 to change the normal fries to the sweet potato fries. It's a interesting texture and of course, slightly sweeter than regular fries. Upon finishing your order, take a seat at your table and they will call your number, which was issued to you when you paid for the food, when they are ready to serve you. When called, proceed to the ""salad"" counter and you'll get to choose what you'll like to put into your Pita from the selection of vegetable and sides available at the counter. The hummus is a staple in all pitas and it's really good! There's no limit to how many ingredients you can add to the pita and the last choice to round up the pita is the sauce, of which you have four flavours to select from.The food tastes not too bad. The portion is sufficient for me. However, I dont quite agree with having to pay for service charge when there is hardly any table service. Note that the price quoted on their menu boards are before GST and service charge. So even though the Half Pita set was decently priced at $7.90 on the menu board, it came up to about $9ish after taxes. I'm happy to pay the GST but it doesnt seem right to include service charge when I am mostly self serving and besides some ala carte dishes where they are served to table from kitchen, all the ordering and payment are done self service.Do try and it'll be great to hear how you feel about paying service charge!",nbYBWghA9fWHz-0JokGotA

It was exactly what I was looking for - I was eating a late lunch and knew I had dinner plans, so just needed something quick and healthy to help tide me over. This hit the spot. Certainly not the best food I had in Singapore and certainly not the worst I've ever had, so A-OK seems to do the trick here.",6d74xseomEdQZ7u5CIkh9A
Pita Pan,pita-pan-singapore,"Came to Pita Pan, a Mediterranean bistro which offers salad, falafel and hearty Middle-East/Lebanese stews because I was craving for hummus. Pita Pan sounds like Peter Pan to me but it's not any happy fairyland restaurant. It was the poor service which ruined what could be a more pleasant experience.This is less like a restaurant at MBS and more like a fast food outlet as diners have to find their own seats and order from the counter (no signs stating that it was self-service). What was more hilarious was the servers at the salad counter told us to order at the cashier, but yet the cashier had been ignoring us as she was busy counting the cash.What can we do but wait before they were ready to key in our orders? The HALF-POCKET SANDWICH ($7.90), was assembled gradually like a subway sandwich. First, half a pita bread was filled with three chickpea falafel. Then, pick all-you-want from the salad counter ( I chose nearly everything), and lastly the dressing (I opted for the tahini dressing also known as sesame paste).The end result looked totally different from the menu but was very delicious, especially the golden-brown falafels. They had a crispy coating but were not too dry inside.Instead of the Middle Eastern breakfasts, we had the Hummus with Mushrooms served with pita bread ($11.90). The bread version here was warm, soft and fluffy. The hummus here was better than Onaka's version because they are not chilled nor too salty. It was extra creamy with generous amount of mushroom toppings. Not quite sure how healthy this was but my tummy was satisfied!Conclusion: Service aside, food was not too bad and portions are quite substantial.

I question the hygiene. I saw staff touch grimy doors and bins then handle food without washing their hands or changing gloves. I suddenly felt very sick!Also a VERY SWEATY looking  woman was frequently walking in and out of the kitchen area.

Pita Pan,pita-pan-singapore,"I remember reading a review on PP in the Sunday Times yonks back and being a big fan of uh.. food in general, decided to head down with a friend. Of course, like all kiasu Singaporeans, I also did some pre-reading on HGW. Bad/horrendous/rude service featured quite frequently - ok, I get it! We had the Red Shakshuka, Mediterranean Platter, extra pita and sweet potato fries. Food was not bad, to be honest. Fresh, aromatic and stuffed chockfull with corriander, the quality was definitely up there and PP is worth a couple of revisits, just to explore the extensive menu. Service was brusque, but not terrible. Perhaps from what I'd read, I'd expected surly servers to give me lip. Maybe I just had the worst in mind, which tempered the entire experience. Tables are packed very close to each other, and it's a pain to suck in your tummy and try to squeeze past. Especially if you've just eaten a load of chickpeas (beans!); not a good idea. If you're getting a platter to share, you'll definitely need more pita to sop the runny stuff up with. This isn't exactly a budget or high end joint, and while the price isn't hefty, it's also a bit more than I expected.",jfJF7wNEYW53_h1mE21ztg

It's really something that feels like it came out from mother's oven - it just gives that whole hearty, warming vibe and has now been put on my list of comfort food.

California Pizza Kitchen,california-pizza-kitchen-singapore,"To me, pizza is the kind of food that comes to mind when I'm stuck at home feeling hungry and lazy on a rainy Saturday night. This is until I head down to CPK for their popular wood-fired peking duck pizza. If you haven't tried wood-fired pizza before, I assure you this will be one of the best pizzas you've ever tasted.  The crust is slightly thin and crispy and filled with a hint of smoky aroma of the wood-fired oven. Topped with with duck slices, garnishes and crispy crackers, the peking duck pizza is one of the must-try dishes at CPK. The ambience of the restaurant is pretty modern and cosy at the same time --Probably due to use of amber lighting. The staff's service, especially the branch manager's, is extremely good. The branch manager was very helpful and courteous in acceding to my questions and request for an extra serving of deliciously fresh guacamole dips. What I have learnt from my visit: You have not tried real pizza if you've not try wood-fired pizza!

Lower East Side Tacqueria,lower-east-side-tacqueria-singapore,"One Yelper put it best, ""About as Mexican as me."" This is not an authentic Mexican restaurant, but this is not to say you should avoid this place entirely. The food for me is three-stars (good enough for late night hangovers and to satisfy my once-in-a-while Mexican food cravings). My go to dishes are the following:(i) Chipotle Beef Burrito - sweet corn & pineapple salsa, cilantro rice, homemade guacamole, jalapenos(ii) Cumin and Grilled Chicken Burrito - Bacon & Pinto beans, cilantro & lime rice, sour cream.Although the food can be much more authentic, the atmosphere and dining experience of Lower East Side is five stars. Foreigners living in the area absolutely love this place! For one, they play top 40 hits (no local coverbands, thank goodness), which makes the dining experience fun and, in some sense, clubby.  Second, its just a really relaxed atmosphere with solid service. Best of all, this place is open til midnight on the weekends and 11pm Monday - Friday. In short, this probably the only game in town, if you are looking for late night food on East Coast Road. Let's face it, Mexican food in Singapore is ridiculously bad, or ridiculously expensive (Lucha Loco and Super Loco exemplify both).

The aioli sauce on the side makes it even better! However, I'm not too much a fan of their elotes. For me, Super Loco in Robertson Quay actually wins that battle.The decor is really neat here. It exudes Mexican realness and the various chairs hanging from the ceiling makes it a great conversation starter. The vibe is very chill and there's always a good playlist on. Alcohol can be expensive; it might be best to come before 8 PM to take advantage of their 1-for-1 deal.Best part about this place? The kitchen is open 'til 2 AM.

Lower East Side Tacqueria,lower-east-side-tacqueria-singapore,"this is a good place to come to, with the bright colors, a well-stocked bar, chirpy service (if you get the nice caucasian lady), and flavors that are fresh and crisp.it was pure happenstance that we came to this place: it looked cool, sounded new-yorkish cool, and that beautiful interior sure is welcoming.mexican food seems to the new in thing in singapore, with south american places popping up everywhere. it's a cuisine that feels familiar, what with an emphasis on grains and beans (very much used in asian cuisine as well) and braised meats, but differentiated with extended use of spices, cheese, and quite a bit of crisp uncooked veg.I'm not really one for the typical burrito or taco, which fills feels like carb wrapped with carb stuffed with carb and topped with carb (slight exaggeration, possibly) - but their meat dishes, salads, salsas and beans (especially beans) do fantastically well for me (almost akin to a mexican on the atkins).chilli con carne of minced beef in a tomato sauce, baked under a deliciously layer of cheese (I like how it forms a slightly firm single layer of topping) and sided with fried tortilla triangles. rich with the beef and cheese but cut through with the tomatoes, this was pretty tasty (the tortillas were really kind of oily, but I've never seen a piece of fried dough/ bread that isn't).I forget the second dish, but it's easier to say mexican lasagne. it was pasta/ tortilla layered with more meaty sauce and cheese, baked with even more cheese to a brown top and steaming middle. tasty, but really filling with all that fat and carb.the freshest tasting dish was composed of tender, pink beef sliced atop a fresh tossed salad. the beef was well-seasoned and had a good beefy flavour, the grain of the meat gave it a satisfying chew, and well-executed pink beef is always a sight to behold. not too sinewy or fatty too, it was complemented by the fresh, crunchy salad and the sweet-sour dressing.mexican food is always hearty, what with its copious use of fat and meat and grains, and we were pretty darn full here with three dishes between two. the dishes are well-priced, food comes in crazy-hand-burning casserole dishes that are almost definitely larger than recommended serving size, service is mostly friendly (except for a dude behind the bar who took over when our lovely waitress was busy), and the place is beautifully done out.relaxing and cooling even on a hot afternoon, this place makes a respectable play for business in the already food-saturated enclave that is katong.",znaofcTB6CKmdUqJSd17iA
Lower East Side Tacqueria,lower-east-side-tacqueria-singapore,"Nice decor, ok food, crap service. This is one of the newest Mexican places in town, and being in the 'hood warranted a visit. We got the elotes, hake taco trio, les mix and a bucket of corona. Now my gold standard of elotes is the one dished up at Mamasita in Melbourne. It's not even that difficult to recreate it, which I've done. The corn here is char grilled, which is good, but waaaaay drier than the mayo slathered monstrosities I love. I loved the guac, and the other items were ok, if a bit complicated, with nice plating and all. It's alright I suppose, but Mexican nosh to me is fun and street-foody so I'm not a fan of the frills and pretty layering. Service though, is terrible. There were two waitresses to a half empty restaurant, and one of which had no idea there was a happy hour promo as indicated on the menu. The other, who knew about it, explained that buying 5 beers would get you 1 free. And since majority of the beers were $15 a pop, I asked if I could mix 5 $15 bottles then. Alas no, and no justification given. Quite silly, really. Our appetisers came in with no cutlery. And after being tired of waiting for service, I went to pick up the serviettes and forks and knives myself- only to have the waitress tell me I have those items on my table. I must have looked rather dumbfounded at that, because it embarrassed her enough to carry the stuff off my hands to my table where my first batch of invisible cutlery was. And when I asked for the bill, I was dismissed with 'wait, wait' as the waitress sailed on by. She later asked me how the food was, to which I replied the corn was a little dry. 'Oh'. That's it. Brings to mind the comic of a shredder located underneath a suggestion box.The place is new, I geddit. And all places have their teething pains, I geddit too.

I was expecting the dessert of the day to be something tiny given that the full set including free flow ice tea only costs $12++, but I was surprised by both the size and quality of the tart.

We started the meal with escargot and onion soup. The escargot came in tiny individual clay jars, heavy on the garlic and oil, and i dunked some bread into the jar to soak up the garlicky goodness. Very delish. The soup wasn't anything special; think I would have preferred a thicky consistency, but nothing much to complain about.We got the Chateaubriand steak (for two), and ordered it done medium rare. It was sliced tableside, done beautifully, and so tender. Tenderloin is not my favorite cut of meat, but this was done exactly how a tenderloin should be treated. The steak was served with a blue cheese and another sauce I forgot, but I liked it just with salt and pepper. The potato gratin that came along with it was so delicate it fell apart in my mouth (and on my fork). We also got creamed spinach but I don't think that was anything to shout about. We washed it down with a carafe of a red I forgot, but it's nice they serve less-than-a-bottle-and-more-than-a-glass portions of wine.I ordered the Crepe Suzette for dessert and they did it tableside.

Fatboy’s The Burger Bar,fatboys-the-burger-bar-singapore-4,"Even though Fat Boys has been around in Singapore for quite a while, I've never been to one. But one weekday night I decided to give it a go. They offer western comfort food, like greasy burgers, artery clogging mac and cheese, chili cheese fries, milk shakes etc.They also offer customization of burgers, so you get to pick your veg, meat, egg, sauces and even buns. You could pretty much create a mega upsized burger with all forms of protein and dairy products, as long as your wallet was okay with it.Most burgers are priced around $13-$18++, you can top up $2.50++ for truffle Parmesan fries or chili cheese fries. Just top up and you won't regret it. Totally worth the extra time in the gym and money!So here was our feast for 3 pax, 2 hungry adult males and I! It was way too much food. I could sense food coma approaching as I looked at the table!1. Shrooms Burger $13++ + $2.50 for chili cheese frieslove mushrooms and the mushrooms here were quite generous. The burger bun was fluffy and slighly crispy on the edges, but as time went by, it became a soggy burger bun. The onions weren't very flavourful but rather, they were quite oily. Nonetheless, the onions brought out the flavour of the juicy mushrooms.I loved the melted cheese. It was perfect for the thick beef patty. I really liked this combination and for the price. I felt that it was pretty decent. The chili fries weren't as good as I had remembered. But the fries were crisp all the way.2. DIY Burger + $2.50 for truffle friesAt Fay Boys you get to customize your burger. For this baby, we haveHoney Oat bun $2 with1. Beef Patty $92. Bacon $2.503. Sauteed Shitake Mushroom $24. Swiss Cheese $1.805. Fried Egg $1.506. Fried Onion Rings $1.507. Garlic Aioli $0.80Total $21.10++It is a pretty pricey burger but it has everything that I want on a burger, no veggies! The burger came pretty quickly and sadly I didn't get the honour of bursting the runny egg yolk. The garlic aioli sauce was addictive and it really gave everything in the burger the same flavour.3. Chicken waffle sandwich $15.50++Another sinful main course, chicken cutlet sandwiched between cheese underneath a buttermilk waffle. The chicken cutlet was pretty thin despite it's length, but it was crispy and breaded. The waffle was quite tasteless despite it's colour. The mash potatoes were strangely cold but tasty.4. Onion RingsI loved these onion rings mainly due to the batter they used. It was fragrant and very crispy. It wasn't doughy at all. The onion rings were huge in diameter and they tasted great with the bbq sauce.5. CalamariThe calamari was abit too chewy for my liking. But the wasabi mayo was it's saving grace. Definitely preferred the onion rings over the calamari.Overall : Decent burgers with quick and friendly service. Just skip the sides.",H8mXfh5XgGCqmMLwVH7k5A

I'm not sure if I'm biased because I had only eaten 3 rice cakes earlier that day but MAN that burger was good! I asked for it to be medium, and although it was a bit too red in the centre for me, it was quite delicious and I didn't get sick from it. The fries that it came with were good, but not life changing.This is the perfect casual spot to meet friends, watch the game, and, hey, it's air conditioned. I'd be more than happy to return!",nzIq7_i0C79ToOp-U5e0fA

Fatboy’s The Burger Bar,fatboys-the-burger-bar-singapore-4,"Wanted to love this place after seeing the menu in the window.  The two of us returned on a Thursday evening October 9th around 8:30pm.  Every seat was taken in this small dining room.  We waited in the queue outside.  After a short wait we were invited in.The staff member showed us to a 4 top in the back of the restuarant.  After we were seated we were asked to move to a very small 2 top back in a narrow hallway.The original 4 top remained unfilled during our whole dining visit.  We were treated to the constant flow of servers rushing by our tableWe placed our order and asked for water for the table as  neither one of us are bar drinkers.  We were told that the water canteen was out front.  It truly was , just left of the front entrance door.   I weaved and dodged my way through service staff and customers to arrive at the water station.  There stacked were the smallest red plastic glasses I had ever seen.  I filled two and proceeded to walk to the back of this place dodging the same crowd as before. i WILL CALL THIS THE WATER WALK OF SHAME.  PUNISHMENT FOR ORDERING A NON CHARGABLE BEVERAGE.The food took some time to arrive to our table and that is understandible  as they were busy.  I ordered a black pepper and blue cheese burger and my dining companion ordered the Holy Ceaser Chicken.The burger was coated in way too much black pepper. The Chicken Ceaser was okay.  There is a sign at the front that says if you don't like our burgers go to the clown next door.  I can think of alot of places in Singapore to get a GREAT burger and food at this price point.  I will take their  advice and go revisit one of my other favorites.The best thing going for this place is there is no service charge.  I suspect that is what packs them in.",M6SBedMGc93C6CQJ8trzag

Peperoni Pizzeria,peperoni-pizzeria-singapore-2,"I've been coming here off and on for a couple of years and I really enjoy it. If you are looking for good atmosphere, varied menu, good pizza, and reasonable (For Singapore) prices for large pizzas, this is the place to come.I haven't been to any of their other outlets, but this really has a good atmosphere, it feels like a true New York neighborhood pizzeria with the tile floors built around the large wood fired oven in the middle.They have a large varied menu which contains many great dishes, I've had their pasta and some appetizers in the past, I don't remember specifics,I was pleased and not disappointed. My last visit we did get the house salad, which had good dressing and was large enough for 2-3 people to easily share.The real draw to this restaurant, and the focus of their name is the Pizza. This is really good pizza, it isn't too fancy, it is just good pizza. They have a wide range of toppings and pre-designed types to order from including the traditional Pepperoni, which is always a good measure to judge by. The pizza is a hand tossed, thin crust, wood fired oven pizza; it has just the right amount of char on the bottom. The pizza is greasy on top, if that isn't appealing, take a napkin and sop it up as I have seen many do in other parts of the world. The table comes standard with napkins for this and utensils along with the usual, crushed red pepper and grated cheese to fine tune your slice the way you want.The $50 21"" is a great deal to ensure all are satisfied and you will have slices for breakfast the next morning, and if a harmonious consensus on the toppings isn't possible at your table you can always do a half and half style pizza. I advise making reservations as they fill up fast with families, couples, large groups and others looking for a good pizza night out.",_DDTeIubkh7QcgMQgcVn6A

So with pizza you can't go wrong making it even if you tried, but to make good pizza....aha....Here in pepperoni, they celebrate the different ways of eating and enjoying pizza.I was tempted to do a Cindy Crawford pizza pull. (90s kids you know what I mean??) For Peperoni, its their speciality.  I ordered the pepperoni and seafood half and half 21 inch.Huge pizza, cut in quarters, it was lovely to my stomach and I'm loving all of it.The cheese is lovely but I think its a bit too much as I couldn't love the ingredients along with it.A lone stray hair came baked in the pizza but hey, its alright as the pizza is a pizza.I ordered a pasta - linguine in pesto... Its alright....not bad...little watery no oomph but cmon its a pizza place! So they're an aiight place to hang.

Peperoni Pizzeria,peperoni-pizzeria-singapore-2,"Peperoni Pizzeria's claim to fame is their XXL (21-inch!) pizza, and their versatility. If you want two kinds of toppings and can't decide on one - you don't have to! You can have both of them on one pizza. Isn't that neat?The pizza crust is thin, the toppings are fresh, the selection is vast, and put to the taste test, the Pancetta (Cured bacon, sliced tomatoes & egg) is delectable. The egg, still runny, goes perfect with the bursting-with-juice and huge slices of tomato, and the pork isn't like the typical American breakfast variety - still salty, not crispy, and tender. The selection of beers (Belgian!) is impressive as well - you have the leffes, the Satan Gold (oh la la!) and if you catch them at happy hour, you knock $2 off the price. Isn't that neat? Still a little overpriced even at happy hour - but worth it for the money you save on the pizza.Compared to the Greenwood Avenue branch, this has a more cutesy American diner feel, as compared to Greenwood's aged Italian pizzeria feel - but both joints have pizza with the pizzazz!",tBoiIg3s8gUtYNeFrYHBLw

Its an ideal place for big groups as they have that XXL pizza you can order and its great for sharing. Reservations are recommended though as the place can get quite busy especially on weekends.Back to the food, the pizzas are baked in a wood fire oven and its something I really like. I guess it somehow enhances the flavour of the pizza. With the XXL pizzas, you can split them into 2 different flavours. I love the seafood and parma ham options. Their appetizers are pretty good too. It may sound weird but, do give their chicken wings a try. They're seasoned well and are really tasty. However, I'd say give their pastas a miss. I'd rather you spend your money on their pizzas.",J-NdrqdYuaBZnD8zo9pgjg

If you are looking for something savoury to warm your tummy, I will recommend you to try Saybons.Served in a cup instead of a bowl, they would urge you to drink it from the cup instead of using spoons to enjoy the soup.

The mushroom soup is better than at many restaurants, very affordable, and I'm always happy to drink it. The other stuff is quite nice too.

Sentimental reasons aside, Saybons is always an attractive alternative to a 'proper meal' as it is cheap, filling and good. While I'm sure the crepes I had in France were different in texture, the crispy crepes here are just as good in their own way. The soups are always decent as well. I usually prefer potato and leeks soup because the others are a little too bland for my taste. I had the seafood bisque recently and while it was rich, it wasn't very flavourful and lacked much taste. I do really like their focaccia bread which is toasted till it's soft and hot inside with a thin, crispy layer outside which I usually get with garlic herb butter. The butter could do with more taste but the texture of the bread is lovely.

Their cheddar cheese broccoli is a hearty one that fills me up and leaves me pretty satisfied. They don't use preservatives in their soups and their soups are made rather healthy!

Although the atmosphere and interior is modern and relaxed, the food and alcohol is just way too expensive! i simply can't justify paying over $25 for fried food, specifically German sausages which you can buy at the grocery and cook at home at a fraction of the price. The $18 grilled pork sausages with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut is probably the ""best"" value. The Weiner Schnitzel was $34, yikes, and I'm not even going into the price of alcohol. Last but not least, I hate restaurants that don't serve tap water and force patrons to buy ""still"" or ""sparkling"". Charging for tap water is fine, although this still peeves me as this is illegal in many parts of the United States (particularly NYC), but not offering it to customers is sacrilege.  Expect to burn a hole in your wallet and leave unsatisfied, if you plan to visit Brotzeit.

The seafood hor fun with egg is so good, I have to take a plate at least once a week!The negative about this place is the parking - there is none.

We did get a bowl of rice to go with our chicken. The rice was the hainan rice and it as very tasty.  I think my overall issue with this place is that the dishes were very small.  It was a little hard to share it with 3 other people.",LzmC0SDuCp4Tps-k9fc0sQ

The ngo hiang is also yummy.

Five Star Hainanese Cuisine,five-star-hainanese-cuisine-singapore,"I'm a chicken rice lover and I am proud to say it. If ever you see me depressed, a plate of chicken rice works as a great cure. So more often than not I seek chicken rice that is of quality,  in terms of price and taste. This joint disappoints with the former. Their chicken is juicy,  really tasty and the whole combination of their well cooked fragrant rice,  soup,  and condiments is easy on the palate. I particularly love their 'hometown'  tofu,  served with ample gravy and minced meat. They also serve up a pretty mean 'egg fuyong'.What is hard to swallow is the inflated prices at this establishment. Half a chicken goes for $16 if it hasn't changed,  a bowl of rice is a dollar or slightly more,  the tofu is in the range of $8-10, and all in all you walk away spending almost $15 to $20 a person for a simple meal. If you value good chicken rice at regular prices,  then there are much better options elsewhere. Somehow I find takeout at this restaurant a better solution. Quite frankly I feel that you get more rice and chicken for your buck this way. For $6, you get a sizeable portion of chicken rice,  plonk youself on the sofa at home and enjoy the chicken rice in peace and quiet. I gave it 4 stars,  then took away 1 star for their relatively exorbitant chicken rice rates.",rRas1bGzAjZmEspPM7BdZA
Five Star Hainanese Cuisine,five-star-hainanese-cuisine-singapore,"Sheesh, the Chicken Rice competition is Singapore is soo fierce that I give five-star chicken rice, three stars. Don't get me wrong, a three star review is a good review. This place delivers a classic chicken rice. I ordered Chicken Meat for $ll4.80 and specifically requested drumstick. Unfortunately, rice didn't come with the dish, so I made a separate order for 90cents. I wish they matched both items to make the ordering a little bit simpler. Nevertheless, the chicken has a strong soy taste more so than other chicken rice chains. My guess is they doused the chicken with soy sauce before serving it to customers. Unfortunately, my chicken was a little dry in some parts, which I was hoping would not be there with my dark meat/drumstick order. The rice was nothing special, flavored with the typical chicken rice broth. The order also came with a huge bowl chicken stock soup. Overall, five star chicken rice delivers a solid chicken rice, not as good some of the famous chains, but good nonetheless. However, what five star has against it's competition is its open till 2am! So if you are coming home hungry late at night after a day trip to Jakarta and are tired of the food on Singapore Airlines, then this is the place for you! :D",anrZv1OM1a2sC_EfZ8mt-Q

The bad:  It's more on the expensive side, but totally worth it.  Other food there...well...I've never tried any of it because the chicken rice is so damn tasty.

Five Star Hainanese Cuisine,five-star-hainanese-cuisine-singapore,"Chicken rice is a comforting, satisfying dish and a staple Singaporean dish. But let's be honest, does a good plate and excellent plate of chicken rice really differ by that much? Should there be a large difference in price between plates of chicken rice at different establishments? NO on both counts. If the chicken is tender and rice flavorful, I'm happy and I'm unhappy if I have to pay a lot for a lot of hype.We stopped by Five star because of the decent reviews and convenient location.The steamed chicken itself was mediocre - somewhat tender in some parts, slightly dry in other places and a bit too cold.  The rice was light and flavorful, but again, not any more special than a good plate of chicken rice at a hawker stall. The broccoli was garlicky and cooked just right though the small portion was indeed small.A bowl of rice was S$1, half chicken was S$16, and small broccoli was S$13. I found the price for vegetables particularly insulting for a restaurant a step above a hawker stall.Verdict: 3 stars for food, -1 star for price.  I wouldn't return and will be satisfied with mall and hawker stall chicken rice plates. This overpriced, perhaps touristy place singlehandedly convinced me never to visit these type of chicken rice places again.",bWYTvHxF8MO4k_Anqf5nPQ
Supply & Demand,supply-and-demand-singapore,"This restaurant is right in the middle of everything. It's along the water, surrounded by many other restaurants. It has both indoor and outdoor seating (top deck) which really connects it to the whole marina environment. It has such an inviting, relaxing, yet hip atmosphere with a warehouse/outdoor cafe feel, complete with string lights, wood accents, and brick walls.We were greeted immediately, and they offered to switch our table closer to the air condition fan when they saw how hot we were. The food came in less than 15 minutes. We ordered the risotto frute di mare and their signature pizza- La Mattina Dopo (The Morning After). It came with a soft egg in the center- that's their thing! It was pretty good.Perhaps the best aspect of this place, the only reason that motivated me to pick up my phone and write this review- was the kindness and attentiveness of the wait staff. Not only were they considerate with reseating us, but when we inquired how most people ate the pizza with the soft egg, she explained that people either leave it for the end or break it and drizzle the yolk.  She went so far as doing it for us!The only reason why I did not award this place a full 5/5 was because I thought the risotto was a little undercooked (a bit too chewy) and the cheese on the pizza tasted as if it was under the warming lamps a little too long before it came to our table. But I still stick to my 4 stars-- all of the staff was so friendly and inviting, even though it was midnight when we came in. They're open til 3am!",9Lsb3IMxyXltwGiT9ZlCDw

The style of Peruvian food due to the huge Asian influences on Peruvian food. Dishes to try would include their Pizzas, Peruvian Chicken, Steak fries with dipping as well as their Sausage platter. While I thought that nothing was particularly mind blowing, I felt that each dish was executed very well and tasted great. Besides they do serve $10 happy hour Belgium beer with a rooftop bar with an excellent city view.Conclusion:This is a new restaurant, located just outside esplanade mall. Nice ambiance and decor. As it is a new restaurant,  there are still a few issues such as staff training.

Taste is good but not wow. The service is average and sometimes rather unenthusiastic. If you want a view, go up to level 2 where they have an alfresco bar. For dining, its still more comfortable to dine at Level 1. But the tables are close and sometimes a huge table may house 2 separate groups at the same time.

Supply & Demand,supply-and-demand-singapore,"The food was great, made up for the lack of good service from the staff there.1. Friend made a reservation for 14, whoever was in charge arranged for a table of 12. Upon arrival, we were told to either wait for a larger table or sit separately. If we wanted to be split up into separate tables, we would've requested for it, there's a reason why we all want to be seated together. Also, why should we wait for a RESERVATION? The manager (I didn't get his name but he was a young Malay guy with spectacles) was not apologetic about it either. We ended up having to squeeze and it was rather uncomfortable eating while seated so close to each other. The mood was already dampened before we even began ordering the food.2. We asked to be served water for everyone (we did order other drinks but that's not the point), one of the waiters came and served us ONE glass of water. So.. Were we all expected to share that pathetic cup together? One of my friends ordered a strawberry tea and they forgot about the order, which was fine because I know the restaurant's busy so that tends to happen. 3. SO MANY SERVERS BUT WHERE WERE THEY?! Standing altogether and chatting in the indoors area. We were sitting outside the restaurant. Waved like mad to get their attention but most of them were too busy chatting. The manager saw us but ignored and just walked away. Eventually one of the waiters came after one of my friends went in to request for service, this didn't happen only once, by the way.I am a waitress myself, have been one for 4 years. I know what it's like to deal with difficult customers. But if we didn't even receive decent service from your staff, how can you expect us to keep our cool? I kept quiet during the entire time when 2 of my friends were speaking to the manager, because I want to observe how your manager/staff handle such a situation. The manager was the least bit professional about it and even responded in such a rude and cold manner. Our total bill came up to $506, and we even had to pay 10% service charge for WHAT SERVICE? SELF SERVICE? One of us cleaned the table up herself in frustration when the waiter took so long to do it. It's just simple wiping of the table, do you need to take that long or even wait for us to request for it? It's all about taking the initiative, your boss isn't paying you to just stand around and talk to your colleagues while the customers are waiting like dogs. We didn't pay to end up serving ourselves either. If the manager was not happy with us because we were such a ""difficult"" bunch of customers, that's fine because he's only human. But be a bit professional and wait until we leave then start being so rude? We obviously wanted some form of compensation for the lack of decent service. He asked us what we wanted, fine, we asked for the 2 pizzas and 3 sides to be free. He responded with ""I can't just give it to you free LIKE THAT"". WHAT'S ""LIKE THAT""? You asked and we answered, then you're not happy with our answer? Why, was it ridiculous? Then why did you even bother asking? You could've simply offered something you had in mind if you weren't going to be happy with what we wanted. We got a waiver of the 10% service charge in the end, which was really fine by us because the food was really great. We just felt unhappy about paying for the crappy service. Overall, I don't know about my friends, but I myself would return but definitely not to this outlet. Perhaps the one at somerset where there's a better team of servers and a more professional manager? I don't mean to be so difficult about it but all we wanted was to eat nice food and be served properly, is that not a simple request? We were there for a happy advanced Christmas celebration only to be pissed off in the beginning. But yeah, the food was awesome!",uz4Z-za2e5xjxtUfF3ZCng

We joined the queue ahead of us and dutifully checked in on the electronic queueing system cum phone number collection, receiving SMS-es, then phone calls from robot voices, all a bit impersonal, but okay if it helps, and eventually got ushered to a table. And that's where it went off track. The couples tables are so insanely close to one another that you're sitting closer to the guy next to you than the wife opposite of you. Not even in Singapore with limited space is this ok. Now, in our case, there was space. We had a table between us and the next couple, but barely sat down, the guy asked us to move over so our table could be joined to make room for four. Then we'd have been wedged between a couple and a group of four, with barely enough space to move between the tables. So, I'm not able to share about the food, because at that point we walked out. If you go there, please stand your ground, insist on a table with privacy, and if they don't accommodate you, just go elsewhere. Hopefully they'll get it eventually.",8uhSaRacb0fkPxe4re4StA

Shades of white, gold and grey give a fresh look and floor to ceiling mirrors amplify light and space.TULSI SHERBETA delightful concoction consisting of basil, lemon, ginger and spices! The perfect drink to enjoy on a warm summer night in Singapore!A very refreshing and cooling drink to have. For one who do not like basil, it really tastes very good.Tandoori Paneer ($20)A traditional Indian favourite - Indian cottage cheese marinated in yoghurt masala and grilled in a tandoor.One never knows that it is cheese until we see the menu. There is none of the usual strong cheese smell or taste. I have thought that I am having grilled tofu.Bombay Pani Pani ($9)A classic savoury snack made of semolina puffs, chilled spice water, sweet tamarind chutney and mint chutney. To eat this, first put abit of the sweet tamarind chutney or mint chutney into the puff, follows by pouring some of chilled spice water into it. Eat it in a mouthful. I could feel all the different flavours in my mouth all at once. Interesting snack item.Chilli Cheese Kulzza ($10)Think pizza, but Indian-inspired.Warm,melty with a tinge of chilli and coriander, these flat breads are stuffed with yellow cheddar and make prefect appetizers to any meal.It is like habing cheese pizza with chilli sauce to dip with. Interesting and different from the traditional dishes.Murgh Angar ($20)Tender, juicy chicken chunks coated with a red chilli marinade.It is actually tandoori chicken, made with a marinade of 12 ingredients which includes cashew nut, ginger, bell pepper, yogurt and chilli. It is tender and tastes quite flavourful with a kind of nutty taste that reminds one of the satay sauce.Lamb Biryani ($24)A meal fit for a king.Indulge in our rendition of fragrant basmati rice, tender lamb chunks and splashes of saffron and mint. It kinds of reminds us of the chinese version of claypot rice. The rice gives an even yellow color after mixing together.Garlic / Butter Naan ($5 per serving)Crispy and fluffy, layers of fresh bread peppered with garlic bits or infused with luscious butter.Butter Chicken ($24)Creamy house tomato gravy with chicken chunks.The chicken pieces are very tender and flavourful, with a melt in the mouth texture. I could mop up lots of the gravy with the fluffy and garlicky naans.Prawn Curry ($27)A medley of sweet peppercorns, coriander and a spritz of lemon.Seldom see prawn curry in Indian restaurant. This version here is not bad except that it is more on the salty side for me.Dessert Trio ($14)Rasmalai - Cheese dumplings with reduced cardamom flavoured milkIt does not taste like cheese and has a cloub like texture. Interesting.Gulab Jamun - Indian dumplings in cardamom syrupThe version here has a golden brown color instead of the usual cream milk color. It tastes light and not as sweet as the usual version at other restaurants.Table's Pop -Sugar free popsicle made with strawberry slices, fresh coconut and chia seedsSurprisingly I could not taste the strong taste of chia seeds. It is not too sweet and quite refreshing.Masala Tea ($6)A freshly brewed Indian spiced teaIt is made of 7 different ingredients which includes cloves, bay leaves, ginger, water and milk. I am surprised that it is served without sugar added. Most places usually served it in a quite sweeten version. It tastes quite strong and fragrant.Overall the food is delicious and not as sweet as the traditional version which I feel most will be able to accept.

Table by Rang Mahal,table-by-rang-mahal-singapore,"Table by Rang Mahal is a permanent fixture in the lobby of the chic Naumi Hotel with focuses on contemporary Indian cuisine. We arrived into Singapore late in the evening and hunger was already setting in with jet lag following closely behind. Rather than searching for a place to eat we decided on this restaurant nearby. While the menu is limited, it had all the classics. We decided to go for something safe and familiar. You simply can't go wrong with butter chicken and naan right? Wrong! The venue was pleasant however, the food was rather disappointing. The Punjabi Butter Chicken was spicy with an unpalatable sour note and the Naan was thick and doughy lacking the thin crispy texture I've come to love. They may excel in other dishes on offer judging by other reviewers but I gauge Indian restaurants by their butter chicken and Naan and this venue failed in two of their most iconic dishes. With a moderate to high price point, I'd say you're better off spending your money elsewhere especially with plenty of other great options available in town.",K74S1UK7QjAhWnkXIN0nhg

Table by Rang Mahal,table-by-rang-mahal-singapore,"Indian Fine Dining is a rarity in Singapore and one of the famous one is no other than Rang Mahal at the swanky Pan Pacific Hotel. Well, there's no need to break the bank though as Rang Mahal has opened a younger and more contemporary sister restaurant at Naumi Hotel. Table by Rang Mahal is a relaxed bistro-style dining concept from the award winning group.The restaurant is conveniently located on street level, right next to the lobby of the hotel.A contemporary open concept dining room concept is at play here at the boutique hotel nestled in the heart of the city.V and i started with a clear asparagus soup (a little salty for our liking) and the Chilli Cheese Kulzza. The fresh fluffy bread packed with mild yellow cheddar, piquant chili and fresh coriander was extremely addictive and tasted way better than it looked. We then sampled the Executive Set Lunch which is available in both non-vegetarian and vegetarian options. The dishes were elegantly presented on a wooden tray and i liked that the portions weren't huge and there is a variety of items. Each set is served with a choice of naan and comes with some sides. From left to right): Dal Tadkewali- yellow lentils tempered with onion, tomato and cumin; Brown and red rice pilaf with cumin and Gobi Matter- cauliflower tossed with peas, ginger and coriander. The rice was the most boring of the lot.Here is the Tandoori Mushroom and Tandoori Paneer Tikka (foreground). I loved the fresh button mushroom in herbed spice yogurt (very creamy) but the paneer (Indian cottage cheese) was rather plain imo. I would have preferred it cooked with creamy spinach (call me boring but wev).The non veg version: Murg Angar and Tandoori prawn. Tender cubes of chicken in a yogurt and red chili marinade. The tiger prawn is a little on the dry side but kinda expected as it had undergone the tandoori treatment.I must say that Table does really good breads. The naans were also irresistible and i keep mopping the lentils up with them. I wished there were other gravy though. A wholesome five grain flour is used to prepare the naan (quinoa, soya, ragi, sorghum and gram). Table also served Indian classics such as tasty Chicken Tikka with cubes of chicken marinated in robust yogurt and red chilli to the more unique Bengali Fish masala - fresh sea bass fillets tossed in mustard and spices. These are available during dinner. We ended the meal with some Table's Pop, a sugar-free popsicle made with fresh raspberry and coconut infused with chia seeds. I never quite enjoyed the iciness of popsicles as it kinda compromises on the robustness of the flavors. The Masala tea rounded up the meal nicely. Rich, thick and flavorful but there could always be more spice.

The buffet breakfast is priced at $22/pax, while the executive set lunch is priced at only $15/pax.

Astons Specialties,astons-specialties-singapore-6,Astons is the best budget steak house in Singapore in my opinion. Always get a hearty and enjoyable meal under $20. Their chicken teriyaki is my all time favourite.,7SfAHIf_hNYrRdhew4pmlA
Astons Specialties,astons-specialties-singapore-6,"Lunch at Astons to try their take on pasta. Their website lists its menu and includes prices, which is extremely rare - well done.Around 11:40am I went there to get an early start on lunch. Ordered the spicy chicken spaghetti meal ($8.90) which included soup and pasta.The soup of the day was cream of mushroom and it was excellent. Thanks for not making some disgusting SoTD flavours like Subway does e.g. cream of broccoli. It also came with a sliver of garlic bread which was also excellent, but small.Finally after 20 minutes (I'm guessing they lost my order) the main came out (see pic). Overall it was good, the pasta was nice, the chicken and diced tomatoes were excellent, but the rest of the sauce was a bit bland, and not spicy.Additionally, no Parmesan cheese, pepper grinder or Tabasco on the table was a bit weird. But overall for less than $9, a hearty meal.",DyiSA0yxVGN8zSRaYHoyMA
Astons Specialties,astons-specialties-singapore-6,"Compared to the other Astons Specialties outlets in town, this one at Bugis+ is probably the least crowded. One possible reason is Bugis+ is still undergoing some renovations as it gets ready for a facelift. I find that the portions served here is slightly more generous than the other outlets I've been to. More value for the same price! But the staffs are sometimes not very attentive. Although there are not many customers around, they took quite a while to come to us to take our orders (sadly, this happened more than once). The saving grace is that their attitude is still overall pretty positive. What's more, I like this outlet more than the other outlets I have been to because it is more open, and has nice natural light which gives warmth to the overall atmosphere.",L5qnan1MZhuF8LetcU-Ziw

Delicious, but perhaps not the best sort of perfume.. Anyway, here on a Sunday afternoon, fairly crowded, seemed to be quite populated with Filipinos. Service was fairly quick - although we did have to wait a little bit for our waters to get refilled.Grilled squid aka Inihaw na Pusit ($14.95) was delicious! Nice sauce and good char-grill taste. Not too chewy, nice bite to it. A bit too charred at some places - we were trying to scrape a bit off (avoid carcinogens.. plus completely burnt bits don't make for the nicest taste either).Bulanglang ($7.45) was pretty good too, hadn't had it before so it was definitely interesting. Mixed vegetables in a rather salty sauce (as long as you don't try to drink the sauce on its own you're fine - just be satisfied with it flavouring/clinging on to the veges!) I liked the eggplant, had a good roasted taste. Other veges include bittergourd (not a fan in general), pumpkin (ok, not that sweet), okra, long beans, some tomato/onion (yum!). Also, four pieces of grilled fish on top had pretty good flavour too!Garlic rice ($1.70) was nice, soft and flavourful; I bet a good amount of oil went in to making it moist/yummy. Haha. Oh well...Pinaputok na cream dory ($11.95) was also delicious! I thought 'cream dory' meant it was going to be creamy so I was a bit wary, but boy was I wrong. This dish came wrapped in a banana leaf (I love foods that are steamed/wrapped in leaves! They are usually scrumptious) and tasted pretty healthy (surprisingly, Filipino food isn't really something I associate with healthy living haha).

The pancit palabok is made with the big thick noodles, but I prefer it with the thinner kind. The lechon kawali was tough, like it had either been sitting around for a while or just overcooked.

Yellow Submarines,yellow-submarines-singapore,"The cheesesteak here is mediocre. The beef tasted like it'd just been cooked and there was neither the flair of the grill nor any fragrance - it tasted like it'd just been boiled and then put inside the bun. Although it was oozing cheese there was almost no onion inside.The chicken coney hot dog was a bit better. There was quite a lot of coney sauce but it was made of chicken so it didn't taste exactly right. It was better than A&W Indonesia's pathetic and limp chicken coney sauce though. The sausage was okay - better than normal chicken sausages in Singapore (what is called ""hot dog"", is filled with questionable material and is really soft). In fact it was similar to the Ikea hot dog sausage. Strangely it was cut in two and fully wrapped with paper which made it very messy when opened.The first batch of fries were good - well fried, with bite and with enough cheese on top. Unfortunately the  second batch were slightly underdone - some fries were slightly undercooked and/or not crispy enough.The mushroom soup was mediocre. It was a bit watery and tasted like there was mushroom oil or essence inside. It didn't taste generic - which was good - but it wasn't quite hot enough.The coleslaw was weird, tasting raw and underdressed. Also, strangely, it was marked as a dessert.",fBL9s_Cym7VJ3AY7Ioeaqw

Yellow Submarines,yellow-submarines-singapore,"I grew up in the US, nearby Philadelphia - the original hometown of the Philly Cheesesteak, which made the ""hoagie"" famous. And I've had my share of Philly Cheesesteaks - from good to amazing.The average cheesesteak in the US is nothing fancy - some meat, cheese, and maybe grilled onions/mushrooms. And the best ones are HUGE and CHEESY. Americans love cheese on everything.That said, Yellow Submarine's cheesesteak hoagie tasted pretty decent! The bread was toasted just right, the meat roasted well and shaved thinly like it's supposed to be. The cheese was melty, gooey, dripping, there was lots of it - just the way we Americans like it! The cheese fries tasted pretty good too! Felt like a pretty ""authentic"" cheesesteak actually. Although the taste was on-point, I didn't feel like I was getting the ""bang for my buck"" - not getting my money's worth - hence the four stars.I spent $9.90 on their classic cheesesteak plus fries, small drink. Since I don't eat so much, so the portion was just right.But I feel like I could have had more food for paying that much - I'd be much more satisfied if the meal was about $1.50-2.00 cheaper.Overall, taste is OK!

Yellow Submarines,yellow-submarines-singapore,"I'm a carnivore and nothing makes me happier than a combination of thin juicy slices of premium beef with gravy, topped with melted American cheese and sauteed onions sandwiched in a bread roll.  The latest option to satisfy this Philly Cheesesteak craving in Singapore is the Yellow Submarines, a cheery and happy spot located in the Toa Payoh heartland. The Yellow Submarine Classic (S$6.90) is a tasty sub no doubt with high quality Australian sirloin steak being used in this one. The cheese sauce also had me swooning and i wished there was more of that in my sub (i gave feedback that they should provide a side portion of cheese sauce for all who wants more heh). The bun was also faultless with its crusty exterior and toasted  buttery interior.  Here comes the but.. and only because i'm too accustomed to the real deal. The meat was a little too thickly sliced and hence it lacked in the juice department. The large onion chunks (a fixture in all their subs) were too Asian styled for my liking. Philly cheesesteaks have long strands of sauteed, caramelized onions, not chunky pieces. And why the ketchup? Now that definitely doesn't belong in a Philly cheesesteak. Thankfully the ketchup taste wasn't too overpowering. I'm not saying it is no good, it's just not authentic Americano. I cannot express how crazy i am about Yellow Submarines' cheese sauce. Made from a blend of several cheeses, this heavily guarded secret recipe is a sure winner. You gotta make your sub a meal with the Torpedo fries and a drink for an additional $3. I say this is certainly one of the best tasting cheese fries in Singapore. Desserts don't fare as well here ($2.80 each). Again, everything was toned down for the Asian palate. Food should educate, not accommodate and this whole 'catered to Asian taste' thingy is sure pissing me off (i'm . The cheesecake was very milky and soft, though lacking in the richness of the cheese. The brownie was dry and not chocolatey enough.Overall, i did enjoy my meal at the Yellow Submarines. The fries are sufficient for me to visit again soon. Do hope some changes will be made to un-Asian-fy the subs. More cheese would definitely be awesome.",4WlVklOsSd409skDsWwQkQ

The first time I tried it was in New York and I must say, the taste is almost the same as when I had it over there. Order the set, it's well worth it. If you're going to eat with more than 2 people, order the large set. I usually order it with edamame beans and rice for the sides. Depending on what flavour you like, you can choose between the soy garlic or the spicy. I usually get the mixed as they are both good. If you're going with a big group, you can even get the 40pcs for $39.90.

First bite, tasty crispy chicken skin. Next bite, dry and tasteless chicken meat. Poor marination of chicken, and I rarely tasted Korean fried chicken to be like that.Tteobokki was very spicy, but it tasted like sauce over the rice cake. The rice cake tastes blend on its own, and the 2 just doesn't taste together like a dish as one.All 3 of us felt that the beef bibimbap was our best order! It's sooooo good! Slight crispy burnt rice, flavorful sauce, balanced ingredients, and we scrap everything off from the hot stone bowl.Ice water. I hate places that actually serves still water with the ""tap water"" taste. So, meh.Service was normal, quick to serve the food, I like it!Total bill for 3 came up to approx $50, which is okay.

They will also give you plastic gloves to eat the wings if you ask. This seems to be more of a trend in Singapore than the US. There are often looong lines here during peak eating hours.

The skin was crispy but the taste of the marinate is but skin deep. Once the skin is off, the meat has hardly much taste. The other dishes we ordered like the salad was a pathetic portion and pancakes were doughy. I have to say, the food looks good but unfortunately the taste don't measure up.

BonChon Chicken,bonchon-chicken-singapore,"I'd first tried the famous BonChon chicken wings in New York City, where they had earned their reputation as the best chicken wings in America. You can choose between two sauces - soy garlic or hot.  Known for its double-frying technique, the chicken wings are crispy on the outside yet succulent on the inside. I was hooked. So imagine my joy when I found out they had made their way to Southeast Asia, with outlets in Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia and yes, Singapore! I got to try the chicken wings in Bangkok and was sufficiently convinced that the standard was more or less the same as what I had in New York.Sad to say, I am not a fan of the Singapore outlet at Bugis +. Somehow the frying technique was not mastered, rendering the chicken wings overcooked and dry on the inside. You still get the flavorful blend of soy and garlic marinade on the crispy outside but the pleasure of juicy meat was nowhere to be found.That said, BonChon also serves other Korean fare like bibimbap and bulgogi, as well as sushi and gyoza to go with the chicken wings.

We ordered the Korean seafood pancake because it looked and sounded promising but omg it was TERRIBLE. For S$12.90, this is pathetic.

The fried mushrooms are too sweet as it is coated with honey. The coating is so sweet that you can't taste the mushrooms.Service was very attentive and courteous.FYI.

So for now, this is my #1 chicken rice place until I find another even better place. This place is near where I live so it was the closest good chicken rice nearby. What else can I say? Something that looks so unassuming, chicken, rice and kai lan, IS that good! We also ordered gizzard. So all that came to S$30. I guess your paying for a fancier kitchen and electricity for that aircon in this restaurant. P.S. ask for the grated ginger, if you don't ask, they don't deliver.",FKWeca2cwUkxJTgW_Tj1nA
Mad For Garlic,mad-for-garlic-singapore-3,"Been here on a few occasions, but my favourite dish to order will always be the snowy garlic pizza -- perfect for garlic lovers. Thin crust pizza with a sweet light creamy base, topped with prawns, pineapples and lots of garlic. When the dish is served, the staff will freshly grate cheese on your pizza, which explains the name ""snowy pizza"". The garlic can be overwhelming, but hey, isn't that already in the name of the shop? Apart from the pizza, none of the other dishes stand out and I find the prices at too high a premium. Service here is a hit-or-miss, often being neglected by the service staff even when the outlet is not full. Fortunately, they are on The Entertainer App and also Burpple Beyond, which allows us to enjoy the pizza at a 1-for-1 deal, otherwise, I wouldn't be patronising this outlet often!",a0VARjOrjhffnICy4NNCrA
Mad For Garlic,mad-for-garlic-singapore-3,"Came here with friends on Monday night upon recommendation. The place is not busy at all. We ordered combo B since it has the popular Garlic pane (basically just garlic bread), Garlic Snowing pizza & garlicpeno pasta. We also got the garlic sizzling rice. Love the pizza & pane best, rice 2nd and would never get the pasta again. There's no meat & feels rather plain. The rice has some crunch due to the fish roe which is a unique addition that i never see in any Italian place. The orange & yuzu ade are just like Italian soda. It's alright. My friends got sticker shock upon paying since things add up after tax & gratuity. We could probably have at least 3 nice meals if we eat somewhere less fancy. The ambience somehow is rather depressing. Probably due to the crappy service and unfriendly gazes from the waiters.",mgxklzhLAXHSgXUYAcqrWA
Mad For Garlic,mad-for-garlic-singapore-3,BBQ chicken ranch pizza ($22.50) - 2.5 starsGot this without the ranch dressing because ranch dressing is bad enough on salads. I ordered this because every other pizza seemed to come with a cream base. The pizza was really spicy for me - it tasted like they'd used chili oil and there was a little fire in my belly for an hour after. It was pretty good but not many ingredients - just the chicken and some salad leaves.With the Entertainer app it wasn't too expensive but I'm not sure I'd come back for the pizza since there weren't enough ingredients. The seafood pasta looked good so maybe I'd try that.,8-16ryk-5pdzUs_6cI_5aw

Mad For Garlic,mad-for-garlic-singapore-3,"Twi-hards, Count Dracula's high court and Underworld hard core fans may want to steer clear of this cheeky Korean chain.  With a name like Mad for Garlic and dishes on the menu like the famous ""Dracula Killer"", the restaurant is loud and proud in declaring it's love and liberal usage of garlic.Personally, I love garlic and I ask for most dishes with extra garlic, a whimsy the kitchen is always happy to oblige!  We usually start with the Dracula Killer, with baked garlic and anchovies served in an escargot pan, paired with bread.  If you don't care for anchovies, the garlic bread is also delicious.  For mains, I usually stick to the pizzas and pastas.  I'm a fan of the garlic snowing pizza, which is strange because I usually don't like pineapple on pizza, but somehow this works.  The garlic carbonara pasta is delicious but heavy, so you may want to share it!If you saved room, the garlic berry ice cream is decidedly interesting.  For something more traditional, the Oreo cheesecake is delicious.PARTING THOUGHT: If garlic really does help prevent cancer, dining out here may be just what the doctor ordered!",Ss6Fz9oK7HCOvYllxpdwEw
Mad For Garlic,mad-for-garlic-singapore-3,"Finally tried out Mad for Garlic this outlet over the weekend. Always saw a long queue around dinner time so I thought I'd give it a try and purposely came to this outlet at 5 pm. At that time I came there was no queue at all. I ordered for Lobster cream pasta - it is priced at SGD$23.50 - on the menu it is marked as one of the signature dishes - and the only signature dish for pasta. This is the description of the dish: garlic cream sauce pasta rich in lobster meat and fish roe. It came exactly as it is described in the menu, however I can very much tell that the chef used frozen lobster - and that makes me wonder: what is so special about this place? I mean honestly, taste wise the pasta overall is just very standard. Then ingredient wise is also very standard. It's not fresh or anything special (yes the word ""lobster"" does make it special, but seriously though). Why would people want to queue so long for this kind of OK dish? I've tried pasta much better taste than the one here (at Mad for Garlic) and priced much lower. Regardless what makes me decided to try out this place was because of the hype. If you are like me, please save yourself and come during the off-peak hours. Otherwise your disappointment will be too great to bear.",kszt8vOPh4xos8OtOqmr5Q

As stated by its name, they put so so much garlic on top of the pizza and tons inside the pasta which makes my stomatch feel really really sick until now.

Baker’s 13,bakers-13-singapore,"Thanks to Vanessa, I got to know this little place along Geylang Road, not far from Eunos MRT station. I have past by this place a few times and it seems like a normal cafe just the like others, but I was very wrong.I met 2 other Yelpers at the cafe, we managed to get a place near the window. It was a small cafe so getting this table can be frustrating, depending on the time of the day. The boss is friendly and sociable and thanks to him we got to know a bit of history of this little cafe and sample some biscuits. We ordered the raspberry scone and for myself, a glass of cold coffee (cafe's speciality) and it is definitely worth it. Prices is pretty reasonable and I would definitely come back to try the others. About the Scone - absolutely delicious. Little bit sweet for my liking but this is certainly one to enjoy for every morning before your day starts. No wonder the duchess of this venue comes here so often! As for the coffee, I think it's worth trying it especially for the first timers. For $4.50, it's definitely value for money. Overall, I enjoyed my time there and would certainly recommend you to drop by there to try the scones. There are seats outside the cafe, but if the place is full, just take it away and enjoy it somewhere else. There are a couple of Malls nearby to enjoy the air con and the scone!",Vtdm-QpN5yYxT-O00cuqFg
Baker’s 13,bakers-13-singapore,"This is my favourite cafe in this area. Reasons why:1. Good location: a short 5 min walk from Eunos MRT station (EW green line). Eunos Station is situated in the east area, near to the historical Joo Chiat area. 2. Yummy food prepared with a lot of heart: the owners do not believe in cutting corners when it comes to food. They prepare everything from scratch; they bake their own breads, prepare their own yummy cakes & tarts, prepare the food (sandwiches, pasta etc) from fresh ingredients. They serve coffee & tea; Selection ain't that wide. That's because they rather concentrate on preparing good food instead of serving so many types of coffee/tea. 3. Unpretentious place & laid back atmosphere:It's a small cafe but it's pretty cosy with nice decor. The inside of the cafe sits about 4, while there are about 3 tables for 2 pax outside. 4. Excellent service:Too bad there are only 5 stars in yelp, for service, I'll give 10 stars. They are most attentive and will top up my water (complimentary) without asking. Always ready with a smile & a chat, the owners & staff made you feel most welcomed. What I'll love to try next is their customised cakes. Plan to order them for future celebrations. Open Mon - Sat: 8am - 8pm. Closed on Sundays.",0DcUFh4oG2IlBGOj9KcjVQ
Xin Wang Hong Kong Café,xin-wang-hong-kong-caf%C3%A9-singapore-22,"This was my first meal when I landed in Singapore a few days ago. I think this is a chain but I thought the food was pretty good. There are a ton of food items on the menu, typical of a Hong Kong style cafe.I got the Hong Kong curry and I thought it was really delicious. The curry was a bit spicy. It kind of reminded me of Indian curry. There were tons of chicken in the bowl but with bone on so you really do have to chew or cut at the meat. They had a pineapple slice which was nice.The butter pineapple bread was ridiculous. It was cut in half with a slab of butter in the middle. I wasn't a huge fan of this one and hope to find something else in the city later.The chicken wings were plentiful but really tiny. They were about half the size of a normal wing. The honey sauce on it was decent but of course it made the wings sticky.Service was, well, not much after we ordered.",taPq7IxYskEWH7Vfc261pQ

It did not look like any mojito that I have ever tried, but it was refreshing and actually tasted really good.  For our second round of cocktails we all had margaritas. They are good and strong!! As far as the food goes, it is OK. I had an al pastor taco and a carnitas taco. They were too greasy for me and I would not order them again. We also tried the guacamole. Once again, it is OK, not great. I feel like it is almost unfair to try to review Mexican food in Singapore. It is not going to be great. I sound like a pessimist, but honestly, I am just being a realist. If I do go back to Señor Taco it will probably just be for margaritas, not tacos.",sS3AW6h3WgKGaa_ZhICRzQ
Gaia Korean Grill + Bar,gaia-korean-grill-bar-singapore,Originally at Suntec which we loved the authenticity of the food.  We were crazy to hunt it down due to the sudden craving for spicy and grilled red meat.  Was here on a week day early just to be sure to avoid any parking issues and eagerly waiting for the opening of the restaurant at 5:30pm......Please to say that they are as good as ever.  Still has the same dedicated waiter serving the food.  Prices were as expected higher but really justify the quality of the food. Galbi was excellent so is the yook gae jung and neng myun.  Issue for us is really the distance to travel from the east.  Otherwise we will be back more frequent.  All in all not a wasted trip glad they maintain their standard.,yNraV5fC6-0m-kgF5P7hqA

Super pushy and tried to talk us off our dishes and upsell many things we didnt want. We repeated 3 times that were comfortable with our order and didnt want the dishes they (2 different waiters!) tried to sell us (obviously we were supposed to get a miss-order by another guest or similar).Still I will go back again and try some more items.",tuAvGU3QxOHWcd7yL3d3uA
SPRMRKT,sprmrkt-singapore-4,"Robertson Quay is undergoing some serious revival with new hotels and changes in the food scene along the river. A homegrown favorite SPRMRKT has expanded and set up shop at the Singapore Tyler Print Institute (STPI) Creative Workshop & Gallery. I've walked past several times but only noticed their bistro concept SPRMRKT Daily. Little did i know that their Kitchen & Bar, which serves refined European food, is tucked away upstairs through a side stairway.The spot is absolutely gorgeous in the day with expansive views of the idyllic riverside. Lunch sets are offered, starting from $30, served with coffee or tea. They have also started their weekend brunches and we say grab a table now!For lunch, start with a simple but wholesome Brussels & Roots with a honey clove dressing. The vegetables are simply steamed- golden baby beetroots and baby turnips along with the Australian Brussels sprouts. The garden of greens is flavored with pops of umami from the slow-baked tomatoes seasoned with thyme, garlic, sea salt and olive oil.For lunch, go for a lighter Pan-Roasted Chilean Sea Bass. The fish is seared and basted with butter, then finished in the oven with a simple touch of salt, pepper, and lemon juice. A refreshing ratatouille adds a juicy crunch to the mix. We agreed with the chicken stock flavored polenta which was rich and velvety with some Parmesan sharpness.For dinner, the Firefly Squid ($24) surprised us with a bacon-like smokiness in the meatless cauliflower puree. I have no idea how but i'd take all the cauliflower puree as a guiltless replacement. The special firefly squid from Japan is intensely flavored, having been marinated overnight in soya sauce, sake, mirin and brown sugar. Definitely order the Octopus & Prawn ($24). This has to be one of the best (if not the best) Spanish octopus i've eaten this year. The octopus is simmered whole with mirepoix and other spices and white wine for 2 - 3 hours before grilling on a plancha. The crispy skin and that tender flesh were unforgettable.I didn't like the Fjord Trout ($19). I'm not sure if it's due to the way it's cooked- mi cuit style, sous vide with salt, but the flesh was mushy and powdery. The flavor was great, just not the texture. Fresh pasta are a must these days. If you like something really meaty, the Malbec Oxtail Pasta ($32) with a smoky Scamorza will satisfy. The oxtail is braised with Malbec (my favorite wine) to impart that berries, plum, and chocolate flavor. Perfect comfort food. Can i have another glass of Malbec to go with this please?A favorite at SPRMKT is the Smoked Lobster Tail ($42) which features a cold smoked and then seared Maine lobster with toasted garlic panko bread crumbs and a Mac n Cheese. The cheese sauce is a lot lighter than usual as they have added pumpkin puree to the Emmental, aged Parmesan, and Mozzarella mix. I absolutely love the Twice Cooked Chicken Roulade ($28). I've not had a chicken so good in a while. The juicy chicken thigh is brined overnight and then rolled with a creamy spinach and mushroom duxelle, before being cooked sous vide and then shallow fried for that amazing Peking-duck-like crispy skin. It's great on its own, with its own jus, or with the amazing curry cauliflower puree (seriously they are so good with their cauliflowers). I can go on forever about the other tender juicy red that is the Stockyard Côte de Boeuf ($94). This 200 days grain-fed 600g Australian bone-in beef ribs is good for 2. The ribs are first coated with a house made Creole spice rub before being seared and roasted. Drizzle a little of that beef jus made with roasted bones, red wine, tomatoes, and veal jus for some tart umami. The meat is served with mixed mushrooms, roasted rosemary tomatoes and vine-ripened tomatoes. Perfect date meal!End your meal with a fragrant and light Earl Grey Creme Brûlée ($16) scented with a lemon lavender streusel base and fresh seasonal fruits.For something rich and earthy, the Three Beet Chocolate Lava Cake ($18) delighted us with the medley of textures created with the versatile root. Of course, we cannot resist a 70% Valrhona dark chocolate lava cake. I wouldn't be surprised to see more of this beetroot and raspberry sorbet on the market. I'm already seeing a lot of beetroot on the menu of many noteworthy restaurants.",4WlVklOsSd409skDsWwQkQ

SPRMRKT,sprmrkt-singapore-4,"This place is at one of the locales in the Tyler Print Institute building at Robertson Quay. At first is a bit confusing, the name suggests a market, and they do sell a few (overpriced) fruits and vegetables, but it can also appear as a bakery, cafe, restaurant, takeaway or souvenir store. They seem to have a bit of everything.As a restaurant they have few tables outside where they serve an interesting menu. Ambitious might be the proper word to describe it. They have common dishes, mostly Western, but made with a slight, almost imperceptible, twist, mainly done by adding a touch of a different flavour, which lifts the plate. For example, the sweet potato fries come with a well-balanced curry mayonnaise. More importantly, the food I've had there a couple of times is done with care and precision. Prices seem rather high, but portions are on the generous side, so I think they're fair (it's Robertson Quay anyway). Burgers are big and delicious, and pasta is served in more than enough amounts. Mainstream beers are expensive at 10++ for a miserable half pint, but they have good craft beers at the same price for a bottle. Coffee is not bad, but nothing to rave about. Cakes are tasty, worth trying. An important thing is they make an effort in offering more local products rather than imports, maybe they could make that more explicit.Inside the shop, there are three tables that serve as a cafe, and there's a shelf that showcases souvenirs of the interesting kind, I'm talking about Singlish ""dictionaries"" and Teochew recipe books instead of Merlion keychains. While these quirky souvenirs are quickly becoming mainstream, they also sell books by Math Paper Press, which are truly good local gifts.SPRMKT has a little bit of many different things and, sometimes, it's not quite clear what to expect. It is, after all, a place to have a nice dining experience and find some amusing local products. It is worth a try, the food is better than it would seem.",AbfS_oXF8H6HJb5jFqhrLw
